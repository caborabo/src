00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:31,454
Hi, hello. My name is Jorge Castro. I work as

2
00:00:31,494 --> 00:00:35,566
a transformation leader. I have some experience in DevOps

3
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,974
SRE quality and Agile world, working at

4
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:42,470
large enterprises and also with

5
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:46,354
different kind of programs, it testing and so forth.

6
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:50,182
So I'm very happy to be part of the event. I hope you

7
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:53,686
can enjoy my talk. Okay, the name

8
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,674
of my talk is building more reliable products through SRE

9
00:00:58,214 --> 00:01:02,394
community of practices. Connecting people makes better continuous delivery.

10
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:07,514
So basically during my talk I'm going to share with you real experiences.

11
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:12,158
Helping and working with my clients in the challenge to build

12
00:01:12,286 --> 00:01:14,914
more liable products and services.

13
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:19,526
The SRE community of practices help us

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,838
to reach that goal. First of all,

15
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:26,994
my introduction as I mentioned before, my name is Jorge Castro.

16
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:32,410
I work as an agility, agility DevOps software

17
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:35,810
engineering test, data transformation leads coach,

18
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:40,378
agile coach as well and program manager. And also I

19
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:43,762
am very lucky because I had the chance to

20
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:47,490
be a speaker and keynote speaker in some events about agile

21
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:50,634
testing and so forth. So you can see here

22
00:01:50,674 --> 00:01:54,854
my contact information and also my LinkedIn account. So please

23
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:59,196
add me to your LinkedIn. It would be awesome if we can

24
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,024
keep in touch after this session and we can build community

25
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:07,244
and share experiences. Sharing caring is

26
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:10,504
my mindset so I believe in that.

27
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:14,944
And actually that is the reason that why I'm here, sharing knowledge.

28
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:19,532
Okay. Basically in this talk we are going to share our

29
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:23,842
experiences facing the business challenge to build more reliable products

30
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:27,658
to meet customer needs at enterprise level. As you know

31
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:31,746
when you work with teams or team of team levels

32
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,418
in different companies, right. The size is quite important if you

33
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:38,494
are going to talk about large enterprises.

34
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:43,294
So my experience is basically helping these large enterprises

35
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:46,374
to build more reliable products,

36
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:50,878
designing and building community of practices,

37
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:54,354
in this case, SRE community of practices.

38
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:59,070
So the idea with this is that when you

39
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:02,594
have this challenge to build more reliable products,

40
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:07,114
you are going to have several obstacles like

41
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:11,662
lack of team collaboration and so forth. So something

42
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:15,054
key here is that a community help us to

43
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:19,038
foster team collaboration, sharing knowledge and fix

44
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,606
the skill gaps and also promote the

45
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,390
hands of work while we promote

46
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:29,234
that walk the talk culture, right. In different situations.

47
00:03:29,974 --> 00:03:33,550
So yeah, that's part of the story. We are going to share

48
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:36,918
with you our real experiences from natural inches, dealing with these

49
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:40,994
bottlenecks with software development teams.

50
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:45,134
Let's take care of the basics.

51
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,274
I assume that most of you know what is SRe

52
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:53,410
and so forth. But anyway, I think that we need to

53
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:57,386
start with the basics. Okay. What is site

54
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,794
reliability engineering? It's a framework, right?

55
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:04,014
It's a framework to handle

56
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:08,944
these operation structure, to manage

57
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:12,184
the reliability of the products in production.

58
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:16,340
SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to

59
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:18,424
design and operation functions.

60
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,980
SRE focuses on running systems in production and basically

61
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:28,344
this work is made by development teams.

62
00:04:28,884 --> 00:04:33,180
So another approach or another concept that

63
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:36,514
is quite important in SRE, it's about service

64
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:40,550
level objectives that slos,

65
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:44,846
which are basically these agreements about the

66
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,494
expected reliability and availability of products,

67
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:52,078
services in production. It's a kind of agreement

68
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,798
between development teams and operations and also

69
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:59,086
our customers. It's quite important for SRE

70
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,878
purposes. Another key point about SRE

71
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:05,644
is incident response processes.

72
00:05:06,184 --> 00:05:09,604
Because of we are talking about production, as you know,

73
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:14,064
in production we have a lot of situation, right? Especially bugs or

74
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:17,488
incidents, you know. So SRE is also

75
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:22,184
about these old processes, about catching,

76
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:25,552
finding, sorting out and

77
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:29,564
improve the root cause of issues in production.

78
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:33,452
So yeah, it's a very important topic

79
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:37,304
in SRE, this incident response processes.

80
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:41,756
So this is a kind of summary about what is

81
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,704
SRE, about this framework.

82
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:48,916
So I hope that basically this can help us to

83
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,264
align our main knowledge about SRE.

84
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:56,036
Okay. About the principles, which are

85
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,036
quite important. You know, principles are important in

86
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,388
any kind of framework or methodology or

87
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:06,940
mindset. Number one, SRE needs

88
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:10,876
slos with consequences. Consequences, yeah, that's quite important.

89
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,304
As I mentioned before, SLOS service

90
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:19,676
level objectives, which are agreements about the

91
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,784
expected availability and reliability of other products.

92
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:27,554
And those agreements are between

93
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:32,090
or among, sorry, development customers and operations.

94
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:35,674
So yes, if you don't achieve

95
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:39,610
some specific SLO, there are some consequences about

96
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:43,170
the service, about the quality of your product, about the trust with your

97
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:47,194
clients, about how trust you are

98
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:51,114
in terms of your product, the quality of your products.

99
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:55,702
Number two, SRE must have time to make tomorrow

100
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:59,950
better. I think that is quite important because as any other kind

101
00:06:59,982 --> 00:07:03,794
of framework maybe has some similar

102
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:07,366
root cause or roots or

103
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,914
origin in link mindset,

104
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,982
or maybe a framework that has some common

105
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:19,618
things with Agile DevOps and so forth.

106
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:23,282
SRe also continuous

107
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:27,370
improvement, you know, be ready for that and

108
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:31,586
analyze metrics, analyze processes, analyze what

109
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,634
is happening in the end to end of software development, to make better

110
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:39,706
products in the future, in the near future. So yeah, that is a very

111
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,666
important principle which is aligned to gai saying

112
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,898
mindset or this continuous improvement mindset,

113
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:50,330
right. To improve the operation of your

114
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:54,418
products in production, the quality, the availability and the reliability.

115
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:57,762
Of course, SRE teams have the

116
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:01,074
ability to regulate their workloads. That is quite

117
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:04,690
important, right. And actually I

118
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:07,842
like to relate this number

119
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:12,014
three topic principle with the cognitive

120
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:15,806
load approach, right. SRE teams,

121
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,294
as any kind of teams, should be

122
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:22,726
able to regulate and manage,

123
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,314
in a good way, the workload to avoid

124
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:30,582
the famous cognitive load. Right. And to avoid.

125
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:36,334
To overload the work and

126
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:40,203
produce a negative impact in the ways of working. And that

127
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,695
quality and availability, of course, that is

128
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,359
quite important. And number four, failure is an option.

129
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:50,159
Sorry. Failure is an opportunity to improve.

130
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:53,919
That is quite important. And actually this is

131
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:57,303
part of a, I'm not going to say a new

132
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,775
mindset, at least a good mindset that

133
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,895
we need to sell and we need to foster in

134
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,056
our development teams, right. That failure is

135
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,536
not something bad, it's something that we

136
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,176
need to use and we need to get, if we

137
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,992
want to be masters of something, if we want to get the

138
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:24,288
best quality of something, if we want to do better

139
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:27,968
and better in each iteration. Most probably failure is

140
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:31,160
the paths. So, yeah, so it's quite important that

141
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:34,554
we need to foster this kind of mindset in our teams.

142
00:09:34,894 --> 00:09:39,034
And actually this number four principle,

143
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:43,894
I relate this topic to the psychological safety

144
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:48,294
approach, right. Because it's about feeling

145
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:52,182
well about fail, but having

146
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:55,822
the idea that

147
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:59,550
you need to take the best from that failure to improve the future,

148
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:02,354
right, to improve your product. So, yeah, that's quite important.

149
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:07,914
Okay, so now after this alignment about

150
00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:12,434
basic topics in SRE concepts,

151
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:16,342
we can talk about a real story,

152
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:19,766
right? A real experience. So real life, real life

153
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,470
business, right? Dealing with customers, with developers,

154
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:26,894
tester production, with issues and so forth.

155
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:31,258
So, yeah, once upon a time we were

156
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:34,226
working at a large enterprise,

157
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,454
an IT large enterprise,

158
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:41,494
something that happened in that company. Is this, right?

159
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:45,650
We had a global and diverse teams involved in continuous

160
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:48,970
delivery. Yes. We had people

161
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:52,742
from Latin America, from Europe, from different countries as well.

162
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:56,534
So more than maybe 600 people

163
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,714
working with different products, moving code to production,

164
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:04,934
maintaining coding, doing quality and so forth.

165
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:06,114
And of course,

166
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:11,302
people, software is about people, right?

167
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:15,182
I think that is key to understand if you are in this business.

168
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:18,926
So in our teams, we had different people with

169
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,994
different cultures, time zones,

170
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,358
skills with working and people

171
00:11:25,406 --> 00:11:28,510
from different roles as well. So that is something quite

172
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:31,966
important if you want to develop whatever

173
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,390
practice or whatever enterprise capability in your

174
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:38,950
company. My first advice is

175
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:42,074
to understand the reality of your team,

176
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:46,598
how global your team are, and also

177
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:49,910
how diverse your team are in terms of technology, locations,

178
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:53,514
time sum, skills, ways of working and so forth.

179
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:57,122
So that was part of our situation

180
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:01,282
with this company. In that company, we had some problems

181
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:05,322
with our mobile products, with our web

182
00:12:05,378 --> 00:12:08,834
applications and actually

183
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:12,106
with our in house applications. Those were

184
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,014
the problems after goproduction.

185
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:19,278
We faced that, to be honest with you.

186
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:24,174
And also we face another problems like we

187
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:28,022
had not reliable product services. You know, we had problems

188
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,594
in production, so our products were not reliable.

189
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:35,750
Low product. Sorry. Low product availability as

190
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:39,510
well. We had some times that

191
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:42,154
our products were not able to.

192
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:47,654
Lack of enterprise capabilities. Yes. We had only a few

193
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,850
people with strong capabilities in as

194
00:12:51,882 --> 00:12:55,974
example, SRE, right. We didn't have a pool of

195
00:12:56,914 --> 00:13:00,054
engineers with SRE capabilities,

196
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:03,654
some of them. So yeah, it was a problem.

197
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:08,434
Low organizational resilience. I think that is quite important,

198
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:12,082
right. Because if you don't have that, most probably

199
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:15,802
when you, when you face a kind of change in

200
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:19,774
your architecture, infrastructure, platforms and so forth,

201
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:24,474
you are going to suffer a lot of pains during

202
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:28,386
the change, of course. And finally lack of collaboration and

203
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,882
sharing. Right. We had some people that they

204
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:36,722
knew the business officer e. They were very technical as

205
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:40,134
I mentioned. Right. We had people from different countries,

206
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:44,806
different. But we noticed that we

207
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,274
suffered a lack of collaboration and sharing.

208
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:51,694
People were working together. It looked

209
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:55,974
like we work to

210
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:59,674
different companies. So we didn't share

211
00:14:00,814 --> 00:14:03,354
goals. Okay.

212
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,322
That was the context we needed

213
00:14:07,338 --> 00:14:11,234
to change. Right. And as you know, change his heart, as Nancy Heart

214
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:15,042
said, but not changing is worse.

215
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:19,034
I totally agree with her. So we decided to change,

216
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:23,074
of course, because of the situation before that

217
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:26,586
I explained before we decided to apply community

218
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,294
of practices cops. I like this

219
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:34,484
concept, this meaning about from

220
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:36,784
Etienne Wenger and Beverly Wenger.

221
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:41,924
Regarding to them, cop is group of groups of

222
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,184
people who share a concern or a passion

223
00:14:46,564 --> 00:14:50,556
for something they do unlearn how to do it better

224
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,364
as they interact regularly. I think I like this idea because

225
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:57,524
at the end that is the approach that we

226
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:01,404
wanted to sell to our client, right. To our company.

227
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:05,888
Community is about people. So people taking care of a problem,

228
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:10,080
right. A business problem, a real business problem. And communities,

229
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:13,924
people learning together to improve something. Right.

230
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:18,184
Have fun and interact. Right. In a

231
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:20,724
positive, in a proactive way.

232
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:24,960
Okay. About this first approach, okay.

233
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:28,586
We said, okay. We have the, these commutative practices, we have

234
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,802
these challenges about SRE and our reliable products,

235
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:35,626
lack of collaboration, lack of low

236
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:40,194
availability and so forth. We had our first

237
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,522
thought about it. Number one, our community should

238
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:46,914
help us to building ways of working SRE waste

239
00:15:46,954 --> 00:15:50,394
working, foster experimentation. Yes,

240
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:53,526
because we noted that most of the problem that we

241
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,914
had is because didn't want to try

242
00:15:57,294 --> 00:16:00,502
SRE practices or DevOps practices or

243
00:16:00,518 --> 00:16:04,022
new tooling and so forth. So yes, we had to foster

244
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,206
experimentation also, which also critical topic

245
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,174
is about collaboration, right. As you know,

246
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:14,694
the most important asset in any kind of

247
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:18,438
company, more than software, is people and their

248
00:16:18,486 --> 00:16:22,062
skills and their knowledge. And if you want to develop

249
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,594
this kind of capabilities through your entire organization.

250
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:29,270
Collaboration should be part of your DNA as a company.

251
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:32,662
So that was part of our thoughts that we were looking

252
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,854
for this community and finally build outcome center

253
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:40,926
planning. Very sure about designing

254
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,462
a community, not only for, you know,

255
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:47,754
bringing people together and share stuff.

256
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:51,354
We wanted to impact business, right?

257
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:55,222
Make people design, run the

258
00:16:55,238 --> 00:17:00,246
community, look for the results to get

259
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,114
impact in our outcomes. So that was part of the approach.

260
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:09,114
We said that we decided to create our SRE

261
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:12,234
site reliability engineering community of practices.

262
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:17,370
Our second thought was about that learning experience,

263
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:20,746
right? The experiential learning and

264
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,474
learning by doing or walk the talk learning,

265
00:17:23,554 --> 00:17:27,050
right. The idea was to, we need to learn

266
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:31,214
new stuff. We need to prepare people to learn more stuff,

267
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:35,098
build new capabilities, SRE capabilities in our community,

268
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:38,820
through our community. And for that purpose, we follow

269
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,324
this approach, this learning

270
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:45,544
by doing approach. First of all, concrete experience.

271
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:49,692
So basically, in our community, we shared real

272
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:53,116
experiences, real situations, working with

273
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,344
Sov, problems with our clients,

274
00:17:56,164 --> 00:17:59,572
we have a reflective observation on the experience.

275
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:03,664
So basically, we analyze the good things, the bad things,

276
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:08,240
the context of the experience, the metrics

277
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:11,524
involved, the people involved, and all the situation,

278
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:16,696
because we consider that we

279
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,800
need to get that experience from this kind of shared

280
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:25,040
knowledge from our community. And then we

281
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:29,136
went to that abstract conceptualization which

282
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,404
was concluding and learning from experience.

283
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,304
So basically, it was okay about this situation,

284
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:38,704
new situation, new skills, new practices.

285
00:18:39,404 --> 00:18:42,812
I analyze the context, experience and the metrics

286
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:46,484
and so forth. So I conclude with some ideas about

287
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:50,444
what are the best movements to implement this approach in

288
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:54,304
my teams, maybe run some workshops,

289
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:57,384
promote some gamification approaches,

290
00:18:57,784 --> 00:19:01,444
um, move some mentoring and coaching,

291
00:19:02,784 --> 00:19:07,244
and finally, learning by doing right, active experimentation

292
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:12,128
in this point, something that which is key is about psychological

293
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:15,792
safety, or basically press

294
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,844
in your experiment,

295
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:22,680
don't feel, you know, panic about failures,

296
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:26,146
and do the experiment right and do

297
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,854
it right. That is the most important part, of course.

298
00:19:30,594 --> 00:19:33,962
Do experiments in, you know,

299
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:37,810
maybe small contexts, and then if that works,

300
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:40,774
you can escalate the solution. Of course,

301
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:44,898
that was our approach for learning my doing. Okay,

302
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:48,466
about the team, right. I think it's a quite traditional

303
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,942
team. You know, we have our community with

304
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:54,994
different engineers from different countries,

305
00:19:56,174 --> 00:19:59,446
business units and so forth. And we have a core team

306
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,514
inside the community. You know, the core team was in charge to

307
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:08,054
design, to facilitate and organize at

308
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:12,022
least the first sessions and the

309
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:15,964
first steps of the community, because our purpose was

310
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:20,140
to rotate this core organization team. So anyone

311
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:24,284
in the community could have the chance to organize some

312
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:27,668
sessions of the cop. We have the leader,

313
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:31,184
which is basically the guy,

314
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,748
the person in church, to lead

315
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:40,164
all this approach, deal with the upper managers, with the stakeholders,

316
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:44,600
with the, with the other communities, to design

317
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:48,524
and to foster the best practices inside the community

318
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:51,712
and drive the community in terms of value,

319
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:55,336
impact and the best for their practice

320
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,184
and its development, you know. So yeah,

321
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:03,272
the lead is a very important role. And as part

322
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:07,144
of this approach, we had the backlog of the community, you know,

323
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:11,384
with all the challenges that

324
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:16,804
we wanted to develop, sort out with our community,

325
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:19,984
you know, lack of some skills, certifications,

326
00:21:20,684 --> 00:21:24,572
some business implementations, some SRE customer challenges

327
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:28,260
and so forth. That was part of our cop

328
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:32,732
backlog. You know, the gaps about our current capabilities

329
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:36,512
in terms of SRE. As part of that, we also have

330
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:40,440
okrs. Our community of practices, our SRE

331
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,804
community practices. We have some okrs.

332
00:21:44,224 --> 00:21:48,072
Okay. Something that was quite important was learn

333
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:51,964
from the past, especially from the failures. And as you may know,

334
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:56,248
this approach to creating sorry community was not the first

335
00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:59,936
approach to create a community inside the company. So that is why

336
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,534
learning from the past was quite important in our experience.

337
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:07,490
So about this topic, please be sure that you

338
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:11,074
understand and share this voice with your team members, with your stakeholders

339
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:14,386
and so forth. CoP is an investment. So it's

340
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,594
an investment. Investment of time is investment

341
00:22:17,674 --> 00:22:21,234
of talent and so forth. So you need to, you need to handle

342
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:24,054
this approach in that way. It's an investment.

343
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:28,768
And then SrE cop aligned to

344
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:31,344
business strategy. That is quite important.

345
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,948
You need to understand what are the business

346
00:22:36,076 --> 00:22:39,580
contexts, the business challenges. So with

347
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:42,104
your SRE community of practices,

348
00:22:43,084 --> 00:22:46,664
move your okrs inside your community,

349
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:50,404
produce impact to these business goals.

350
00:22:50,524 --> 00:22:54,380
Right. The business challenges are

351
00:22:54,412 --> 00:22:57,648
going to be more products, velocity,

352
00:22:57,736 --> 00:23:01,424
quality, reliability, win more clients

353
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:05,128
and so forth. And I'm pretty sure that SRE Cop can

354
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,764
help you with that. I'm pretty sure about it.

355
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:12,576
Okay. Some examples about OKR, about okrs that

356
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,360
we designed in our community. Number one, improve your reliability

357
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:19,432
and availability. Okay. That was one objective.

358
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:23,458
And as an example, key results achieve an x

359
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:26,954
percent reduction in a number of incidents impacting production

360
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:30,274
services. Another example, number two,

361
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:33,434
improved team collaboration. Key results,

362
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:37,186
launch x cross functional workshops or

363
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,866
hackathons with global groups from different teams.

364
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:44,014
Right. And number three, increase SRE enterprise capabilities.

365
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:47,786
It results increased participation in SRE

366
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,906
related training courses or certification by x percent

367
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,386
within the community. Okay, those are examples that

368
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,442
we use in our community. You can add more, you can

369
00:23:58,498 --> 00:24:02,178
choose a different ones, but basically please remember that depending

370
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:06,130
on your business challenges, depending on the business

371
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:10,490
strategy that you are aligned to, you need to define your okrs.

372
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:14,818
Okay? Now this is a very, very important tool

373
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:18,706
that you can use to design your community. This is the minimal

374
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:22,492
viable community, the MVC. And as you can see, as you can

375
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:25,900
see here is a canvas that helps

376
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:29,980
you to design your first approach of

377
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,356
SRE community. Actually, you can use this for any kind of

378
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,708
community, but in this case we use that for community.

379
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:40,264
So now we are going to check

380
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:43,876
topic by topic and we are going to

381
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,032
share our experience about that. Okay? Number one is

382
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:51,120
the purpose. In our case, our purpose was bringing together

383
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:54,568
experts and enthusiasts, sorry, enthusiasts,

384
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:58,544
to share knowledge, skills and experiences related to

385
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:01,952
improving the reliability and performance of digital services

386
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:05,600
and build doers culture. That is quite important,

387
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,872
right? Because more than bringing people

388
00:25:08,968 --> 00:25:12,364
to work together to share knowledge, to help each other,

389
00:25:12,764 --> 00:25:15,544
also we want to make builders, right.

390
00:25:16,324 --> 00:25:20,036
We want to build doers, doers, that at

391
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,100
the end, they are the ones to create impact through experiments,

392
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:27,692
through trying new stuff and to deal with

393
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:31,756
real, real problems in production or in business.

394
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,464
So that was our purpose for our community.

395
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:39,616
Number two, the audience. Well, basically the audience of the community where

396
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,464
our SRE engineers, developers, devopsrs,

397
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,936
operation engineers and so forth, right? All the people involved in end

398
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,604
to end software development, production development,

399
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:53,432
they were our public, our team members in the

400
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:57,728
community. Number three, both values we

401
00:25:57,776 --> 00:26:02,024
promote the values of sharing knowledge, experimentation, collaboration and outcome

402
00:26:02,064 --> 00:26:05,418
base, which was quite important for the success,

403
00:26:05,616 --> 00:26:09,342
for the future success of our community. Number four,

404
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:12,502
the goal, right. Well, the okrs that

405
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,194
I showed before, they are examples of the goal.

406
00:26:16,694 --> 00:26:20,582
Please be sure to align to the transformation

407
00:26:20,678 --> 00:26:24,614
and business goals. That is quite important that you align your community

408
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:28,150
goals to that transformation approach that you are doing in your

409
00:26:28,182 --> 00:26:31,638
company and your business goals. About.

410
00:26:31,686 --> 00:26:35,430
Number five is quite important is that expectation, you know,

411
00:26:35,622 --> 00:26:39,038
and basically it's about the community member

412
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:43,070
experience, right. You know, we had in the market developer

413
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:46,990
experience, sorry about that.

414
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:50,434
That was Alexa. So we have in the market,

415
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:55,314
sorry, we have in the market customer experience,

416
00:26:56,934 --> 00:27:01,014
developer experience. And basically this topic is about community

417
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:04,776
member experience, which is a function of reality and expectation.

418
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,724
And that is quite important because we said before that

419
00:27:08,804 --> 00:27:12,524
the community, the SRE community is an investment.

420
00:27:12,684 --> 00:27:16,500
We said before that you need to align your SRE

421
00:27:16,612 --> 00:27:20,452
community okrs or goals to your business strategy and

422
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:24,140
you need to have outcome based approach inside

423
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:27,436
your community and about all activities that

424
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,374
you are going to do, training sessions, workshop and so forth.

425
00:27:31,564 --> 00:27:34,690
So that is quite important as well. Your team member,

426
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:38,146
the people that is going to be part of the community are your

427
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:41,426
clients. So you need to take care of your clients and you need to take

428
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,094
care about why they thought about the community and

429
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:49,346
what they are expecting from the community. It's a key

430
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,042
topic, right. So for that approach, for example, at the beginning of the

431
00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:57,294
community we ran these kind of feedback loops and

432
00:27:57,994 --> 00:28:01,984
we got this feedback from our SRE engineers

433
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:05,800
with our former team members. Very interesting, right.

434
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:09,924
As you can see here, basically people is saying that

435
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:14,544
they don't want from the community more PPT or

436
00:28:14,584 --> 00:28:18,248
more talks. They want

437
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:22,664
real experiences, hands on approaches and

438
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:26,484
also they wanted to know more real

439
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:30,912
failures are real victories or success stories in

440
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:34,224
SRE projects. That was quite important for us,

441
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:36,604
especially for design work, our community.

442
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:40,680
Okay, number six, the rules. Basically, as I mentioned, we had

443
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:43,808
the cop lead the core team, you know,

444
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:47,912
number seven, the rules basically is about the schedule, the participation,

445
00:28:48,088 --> 00:28:51,376
core team agreements and so forth. You know all, you know,

446
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,424
it's about, it's about all the topics, you know, all the

447
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:59,588
topics that you need to set up with your teams in terms of the

448
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:03,156
function, the operative function of your community.

449
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,956
Number eight, goals, how to prioritize backlog okrs updates,

450
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,100
learning initiatives, decision making and so forth. That is quite important,

451
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:13,068
right about, sorry about number nine,

452
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:17,012
communication basically are the channels to communicate inside your

453
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:20,774
community. Slack teams, internal social networking,

454
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:24,550
etcetera. Okay, a very important topic

455
00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:27,594
about these are the metrics, some metrics recommendation.

456
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:32,166
Well, basically three, we recommend that you use the

457
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,558
metrics of shares and collaboration. Basically how your

458
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:38,582
teams collaboration is collaborate with your royal teams.

459
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:42,134
An indicator of that, the number of experiments, cassian experiments

460
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:45,486
for example. And finally the outcomes, they are quite important.

461
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,910
The quality, the speed, the savings, the reliability that

462
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:53,862
you are reaching because of your community and

463
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:57,726
its operation. How do we make cop

464
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,822
last longer and more engaged? Yeah, I think that is a

465
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:05,006
good topic because we noticed that in the previous

466
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,462
cop approaches. The cop at the

467
00:30:08,478 --> 00:30:12,794
beginning was strong, but after some iterations it disappeared.

468
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:17,102
So we wanted to change that. And basically for that approach

469
00:30:17,238 --> 00:30:20,726
to make larger, long, larger communities,

470
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,062
we apply this, the minimum enjoyable game. So we

471
00:30:24,078 --> 00:30:27,790
applied gamification, right? We combined some gamification approaches with

472
00:30:27,822 --> 00:30:31,434
lean setup approaches to design the most

473
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:35,062
valuable and simple games inside the

474
00:30:35,078 --> 00:30:38,428
community to foster collaboration,

475
00:30:38,556 --> 00:30:42,060
learning and so forth. So make our

476
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,824
team members enjoy the experience.

477
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:47,924
For that approach, I recommend you to use this framework optalysis.

478
00:30:47,964 --> 00:30:51,064
It's a game design and human design framework. Very useful.

479
00:30:52,444 --> 00:30:56,316
And also as part of that we create this game right inside

480
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,684
the community. We create that reliability leak game

481
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:03,228
which is basically a combination of game design, Optalis framework

482
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:06,762
and human design approaches. And also link strap

483
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:10,946
in. This game was quite simple, right. We have the

484
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,826
people with strong skills in SRE who were

485
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,330
the Batmans inside this game and each Batman

486
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:21,818
has the psyche, right? The SrE psyche and

487
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:25,890
those Sre psyche were the juniors or the developers that need to

488
00:31:25,922 --> 00:31:29,426
develop SRE capabilities and so forth. So is Batman worked together

489
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,584
with the psyches and the Batman do whatever

490
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:37,664
they need, whatever she needs to do to create

491
00:31:37,784 --> 00:31:41,004
more heroes, you know, to develop the sidekick

492
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:45,680
and move their, practice their skills to another level. It was very

493
00:31:45,712 --> 00:31:49,544
funny, you know, we had a lot of backmans, we had a lot of sidekicks,

494
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:52,524
robins. It was very funny to work with that.

495
00:31:53,104 --> 00:31:57,376
Finally what we achieved a lot of things, I think increased number of experiments.

496
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,902
That was quite important, you know, do more experiments in a company,

497
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:04,798
improve services availability. Of course we improved

498
00:32:04,886 --> 00:32:08,350
that metric. That actually was a pain, was a real

499
00:32:08,382 --> 00:32:11,654
pain in our business. We improve our turnover, right?

500
00:32:11,774 --> 00:32:15,022
Because with this kind of approaches, gamification community

501
00:32:15,198 --> 00:32:19,726
people feel different, right? This kind of learning,

502
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:24,046
they feel motivated to share with their mates

503
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,082
and have fun. Through navigation, it helped us to improve the turnover

504
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:30,706
rate and finally the developer experience.

505
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,634
Yes. When we ran some feedback loops about the

506
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:37,898
NP's of the sessions of the community,

507
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:41,934
we got very good results about the experience of our developers.

508
00:32:42,554 --> 00:32:46,426
So finally some learned lessons. Rotate the cop core

509
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:50,098
team. That is quite important. Please try to more people can have

510
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:54,002
the responsibility to is to facilitate different

511
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:58,010
sessions. That is quite important. You are what your community is.

512
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:01,682
Yeah, that's true. So if your community foster

513
00:33:01,738 --> 00:33:05,802
team collaboration, experimentation, outcome base, the people

514
00:33:05,898 --> 00:33:09,490
inside the community is going to get that. So please be sure about

515
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:13,002
it. Your business grows as your communities and

516
00:33:13,018 --> 00:33:16,218
people grow. Yeah, that's quite important. If you

517
00:33:16,386 --> 00:33:19,826
can impact your business, I'm pretty sure that your community is going

518
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,180
to grow, not only people and maybe also in

519
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:27,756
budget and more resources. So yeah, and finally cop

520
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,972
improve developer experience. Yeah, that is quite important. So if you are,

521
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:34,460
if you're facing some leavings of

522
00:33:34,492 --> 00:33:38,260
developers or some bad numbers in terms of developer

523
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:42,024
experience, I recommend you to use cops and also gamification for that approach.

524
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:46,428
SRE cop can help you to build, enable and develop SRE

525
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:49,968
that replace capabilities as part of your business goals while

526
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:53,816

527

benefit and have fun also, right,

528
00:33:56,712 --> 00:34:00,176
people and business oriented collaboration inspires

529
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,544
people to become doers. And those doers

530
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,484
they make possible to build reliable products.

531
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:10,680
