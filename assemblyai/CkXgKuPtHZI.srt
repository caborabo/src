1
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,154
Today I will talk on the topics that is not commonly covered on such conferences.

2
00:00:32,663 --> 00:00:35,887
Well discuss core infrastructure and data

3
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:38,003
centers infrastructure in particular.

4
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:42,375
Of course, all engineering topics are very complicated

5
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,843
and deep and it's impossible to cover them all.

6
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:49,735
I just want to slightly open this box and have a look inside

7
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,039
and hoping in case of need, you will know where to look

8
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:56,723
deeper. But before that, let me introduce myself.

9
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:00,916
My name is Yigor and I have been leading critical IT

10
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,252
infrastructure for more than 15 years now.

11
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:08,172
I am ahead of IT infrastructure of one of the worlds biggest

12
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:12,220
marketplaces. And before that I led infrastructure transformation

13
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,184
at one of Europes largest banks and IT ecosystems.

14
00:01:17,804 --> 00:01:21,692
Developers, IT architects, and other field professionals

15
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:26,104
often lack a solid understanding of core IT infrastructure.

16
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:31,134
This gap in knowledge can be fatal, especially for critical systems.

17
00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:34,654
So today we'll try to bridge the gap and talk about

18
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:38,190
why it's important to understand one of the main parts of core

19
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:40,474
infrastructure, the data center level.

20
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:45,110
We'll discuss the data center infrastructure setup and operations,

21
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:48,886
and the main idea of this talk is to invite you to a virtual

22
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,582
tour of the datacenter main systems and let you see

23
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:54,354
how this system works.

24
00:01:56,144 --> 00:01:59,464
Imagine hosting your systems on the core infrastructure

25
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:02,244
as you were sending your child to a daycare.

26
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:06,240
You could choose the cheapest or closest kindergarten, but will

27
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:09,816
your child be safe and sound there? As a

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,208
responsible parent, you would normally research and select

29
00:02:13,256 --> 00:02:16,844
the best option to ensure your child's safety and comfort.

30
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:21,528
Actually, the same way you should investigate and choose the best infrastructure

31
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:24,874
environment for your systems to provide their required level

32
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,974
of reliability and resilience.

33
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:32,490
That's why it's important to understand what core infrastructure systems

34
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:36,386
are now hosted and we at infrastructure department

35
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,386
call it infrastructure awareness. This concept

36
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,778
presumes the deep understanding of all engineering and ITC systems

37
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:46,414
behind the product level.

38
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:52,180
Actually, you may have a question if infrastructure awareness is

39
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:56,340
important for all kind of IT systems, and the answer is,

40
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:59,824
it depends how critical the system is.

41
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:04,092
The more critical system is, the deeper infrastructure awareness

42
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:08,172
should be. If you are working a personal pet

43
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:11,652
project, you can actually run it on your local

44
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,132
PC, and if something fails, it's not a

45
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:18,824
big deal. Only you as a developer are affected

46
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:22,688
and you can fix it at your own pace. However,

47
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:26,792
if you are responsible for corporate application used by many people

48
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:30,480
and tied to business processes, the stakes get higher.

49
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:34,200
Even if small back office application for ordering lunches

50
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:38,264
goes back for a week, it will be inconvenient

51
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:41,976
but not disastrous. Still, it is a much greater

52
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,636
issue than a pet project failure, and in

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,692
case of failure of marketplace application for customers,

54
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:51,544
the impact of downtime will be huge,

55
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:55,668
critical business processes will be down, and even the whole

56
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,184
existence of business can be at risk.

57
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:02,668
Many root causes of critical failures are located on the

58
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:06,268
infrastructure racks or server fails,

59
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:09,892
connectivity fails, and so on. That's why we should

60
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:13,650
very carefully think of core infrastructure. This is exactly what

61
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:16,414
I mean by infrastructure awareness.

62
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:23,170
So first of all, you need to define how critical your system

63
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:26,814
is and define what to do in case of possible failures.

64
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:30,890
Usually the system architects limit themselves to a platform

65
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:34,834
level. For example, they plan several instances and

66
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:38,538
in case of fails, the rest will be

67
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:42,522
bear the load. If we deal with non critical systems,

68
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:46,454
it's totally enough to stop on this level and that's it.

69
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:50,210
But if the system is critical, then you must

70
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:53,610
drill down further. There are many more questions to be

71
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:57,834
answered. For example, what are your servers and virtual servers hosted?

72
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:00,826
What kind of cloud provider is used, if any?

73
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,498
Are your servers old on you? In what kind of quality

74
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:08,284
of data centers they are hosted, in what geographical regions and

75
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:10,504
country the data center placed,

76
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:14,620
and many, many more. One of the

77
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:18,708
most important elements of core infrastructure with developers and architects

78
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,980
often overlook, is data centers. I'll give

79
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:25,348
you a moment to try and figure out what systems

80
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:26,464
it includes.

81
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:34,184
The three pillars of any data center are electricity,

82
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:38,450
cooling, and connectivity. Let's elaborate

83
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:42,522
a bit of each. Electricity is a lifeblood of data

84
00:05:42,578 --> 00:05:46,762
centers. Obviously, without a reliable power

85
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:50,494
supply, servers and other hardware cannot function.

86
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:54,186
Data centers often have multiple power sources,

87
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,330
including backup generators and uninterruptible power supplies,

88
00:05:58,482 --> 00:06:02,334
providing continuous operations during mainline power outages.

89
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:07,288
Then comes cooling. As you may know, data centers

90
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:11,032
generate a significant amount of heat. Effective cooling

91
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:14,248
systems remove heat energy from IT equipment.

92
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,872
They prevent hardware failures caused by overheating,

93
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:20,712
and later on we'll talk about it more in details.

94
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:25,152
Basically, the goal is to remove heat and connectivity,

95
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:28,364
without which data centers are completely useless.

96
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:32,796
That is a must. All other engineering systems you

97
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,412
could heard of, like fire extinguishing physical access systems,

98
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:39,464
automation are actually optional.

99
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:44,916
Data centers come in different sizes,

100
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,740
but how do we measure them? Do we need to know the area

101
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:51,988
of the building, or do we know the count or

102
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,368
number of recs or units? No,

103
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:58,960
no, and no. The funny thing

104
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:02,444
is that data centers are measured in catals.

105
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:06,688
In other words, we use power watts to understand

106
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:10,064
the capacity of a data center. Of course,

107
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:13,936
more often we speak about thousands of kettles or megawatts.

108
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,256
A small size data center has a power capacity up

109
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,486
to 3 mw. Medium sized data center, three to 10.

110
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,030
We consider 10 more as data centers

111
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:29,718
for a large size. For context, 1 mw

112
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:33,554
is enough to energy the power about 200 homes.

113
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:39,046
And what about XXL size? When we

114
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,014
speak about hyperscalers such as Amazon,

115
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:45,454
Google, Meta and so on, their data center

116
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:47,674
capacity reaches a gigawatt.

117
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:52,218
To give an idea how big this number is, let me just

118
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:56,450
say that all in all, in 2023, data centers consumes

119
00:07:56,522 --> 00:08:00,274
around eight gigawatts of power. So you can see half of

120
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,974
this amount is consumed by the hyperscalers.

121
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:09,370
As we have discovered, data centers need power and

122
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:12,898
I like to visualize it as a tree like structure

123
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:16,308
with a trunk and numerous branches and leaves.

124
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:20,748
It is a fitting metaphor for redistribute electricity from

125
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:24,612
one central source to numerous consumers, ensuring that power

126
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:27,304
reaches every endpoint device.

127
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:32,740
Actually, electricity comes from the local power grid with the

128
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:36,652
high voltage transmission lines on its way to data center

129
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,738
consumers. High voltage is transformed to medium and

130
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:46,610
then to low usable wattage from

131
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:51,210
the transformer. Electricity goes through the primary distribution panel

132
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:54,874
which you can see on the screen to be further distributed

133
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:59,954
to it. Equipment load electricity

134
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:03,442
also always goes into Ups which stands for

135
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:06,940
uninterruptible power supply for backup power in

136
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:08,584
case of grid failure.

137
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:14,420
On the screen on the top of raxd you can see distribution

138
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:18,268
busbar with the hanging red distribution outlets

139
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,744
which are connected to the server racks.

140
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:26,980
That's what a diesel generator looks like. In case

141
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:30,644
of continuous grid failure, it will take the it load on.

142
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:33,944
The data center will keep on working as long as is

143
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:37,752
needed. A diesel generator can operate even for

144
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:41,296
months. Now we know

145
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,912
the data centers consume huge amount of electricity

146
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:47,764
and I have a tricky question for you.

147
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:51,484
What are the things the electricity is used for?

148
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:54,284
I'll give you a moment to make a guess.

149
00:09:57,424 --> 00:10:02,308
The answer is heat. Electricity is 100%

150
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,624
transformed into heat and to nothing else.

151
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:11,820
To get rid of produced heat, we need to take this heat away

152
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:15,424
somehow, and there are many ways to do it.

153
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:19,844
Cooling techniques fall in two main air based

154
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:23,284
and non air based. Air cooling used by

155
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:27,242
vast majority of data centers includes common air conditioning

156
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:30,994
systems and no air cooling system. Use water,

157
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:33,254
oil or solid materials.

158
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:38,634
Air conditioners are the data centers most common air

159
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:41,802
cooling methods. They actually function the same

160
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:45,614
way as the ones we have at homes. Just bigger.

161
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:51,170
Chillers are the second most common cooling systems,

162
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:54,770
using water or water based solutions to transfer heat

163
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:58,810
from it equipment halls to outside. They are

164
00:10:58,922 --> 00:11:02,994
more energy efficient than air conditioners, but require more

165
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:05,374
complex installation and maintenance.

166
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:10,254
Adiabatic cooling involves chambers or mats.

167
00:11:10,714 --> 00:11:14,534
Water evaporates in them and cools the air inside.

168
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:18,090
This technique is normally used in addition to

169
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:22,498
other cooling methods, exotic methods

170
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:26,578
including peltier elements which rely on thermoelectric

171
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:30,394
effects, and underwater data centers like Microsoft project

172
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:31,334
Natit.

173
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:37,650
There is a method that stands out of other cooling techniques.

174
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:41,778
It's called free cooling and it uses normal outside air.

175
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:45,454
As it is, free cooling is just running

176
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:48,726
the outdoor air through it equipment and does

177
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,342
nothing more. If the air is warm, we just

178
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:55,750
need to run more air through the servers, as free

179
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:58,894
cooling requires nothing but air fans and outside

180
00:11:59,014 --> 00:12:02,954
air. This technique is extremely energy efficient

181
00:12:03,654 --> 00:12:07,342
and to be honest, free cooling is my favorite cooling methods

182
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:10,602
in which I have quite a broad experience and I

183
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:13,898
am always eager to discuss and answer any questions about

184
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:17,074
that. As I said,

185
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,970
freecooling is one of the most efficient cooling technologies and it

186
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:24,826
provides the highest power usage effectiveness, or pue

187
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,602
value, which one of the most important metrics to understand

188
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:32,354
the efficiency of data centers? Many companies

189
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:36,326
worship pue as a sacred animal. Let's try to

190
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,234
figure out why it's so important.

191
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:43,030
What is pv power usage effectiveness is a

192
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,646
ratio that describes how efficiently a data center

193
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,430
uses energy, especially how much energy is

194
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:54,286
used by computing equipment. In contrast to cooling and other

195
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,114
overhead that support the equipment,

196
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:02,198
ideally it equals one, which means that all energy

197
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:05,514
is used for it equipment without any wastage.

198
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:09,252
However, achieving this perfect scenario is

199
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:13,324
impossible in real world. There are different methodologies

200
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:16,732
for calculating PvE. For example, there is a

201
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:20,396
way to calculate an instantaneous PVE. On the

202
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,572
other hand, a more comprehensive assessment will be

203
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:26,584
to calculate an annual average pUv.

204
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:32,284
I have just said that it is impossible to achieve pv

205
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:35,522
equal to one. But how do you think if it

206
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:38,654
is possible to achieve pv less than one?

207
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:43,058
And the answer is yes. But for this, we need to

208
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:46,574
switch from the terms of power to the terms of money.

209
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:51,266
For example, few data centers in USA and Europe

210
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,178
use heating pipes and sell hot water to the nearest

211
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:58,922
towns. In this case, if we calculate their PvE

212
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:02,522
in terms of money, it will be even less than one

213
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:06,114
because they get profit from selling this hot water to

214
00:14:06,274 --> 00:14:09,970
facilities now to

215
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:13,698
more tangible things. Many it professionals are well

216
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:17,534
familiar with the servers and regs, but there are also

217
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:21,602
those who are not. And this is the opportunity to have a quick

218
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:25,418
tour of a data hall and get an overall impression of its

219
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:29,100
setup. For many

220
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:32,692
of you, it's obvious, but I'll mention it. The data centers

221
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:36,564
servers are mounted in racks, which are standardized frames or

222
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:41,012
cabinets that host multiple servers and network equipment.

223
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:43,024
This is the way they look,

224
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:48,784
and here is the view from another angle.

225
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:56,920
Each rack contains many units, allowing servers to be stacked

226
00:14:56,952 --> 00:15:00,416
vertically. This setup provides easier operation

227
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,684
and maintenance and maximizes space efficiency.

228
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:07,496
As you can see, network ports and drive slots are located

229
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,272
in the foreign part of servers so that a data center

230
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,644
engineer can easily access them.

231
00:15:18,204 --> 00:15:21,468
Now we are witnessing the rise of ML

232
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:24,636
and AI technologies, so more and more capacities

233
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,784
of data centers are allocated to GPU's.

234
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:32,236
The GPU's through physically small consume significant

235
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,484
amounts of electricity. One GPU

236
00:15:35,524 --> 00:15:38,744
node can consume more than 8 power.

237
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:42,584
That means they produce the same huge amount of heat.

238
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:46,520
To address this problem, data centers have to upgrade the

239
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:50,464
electrical and cooling infrastructure to support their increased

240
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:55,216
power and cooling demand to

241
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,284
wind up let us quickly go through the today's takeaways.

242
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:03,680
The three pillars of any data centers are electricity,

243
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:07,480
cooling and connectivity. Today we have a virtual

244
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:10,486
tour of the data center electricity infrastructure.

245
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,946
We made an overview of the DC cooling technologies,

246
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,650
the special focus on free cooling. We also shortly covered

247
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:20,906
data center servers including GPU's. But if

248
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,906
you take away only one thing from today's talk,

249
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,138
let then it be this. The more critical your

250
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:31,418
system is, the deeper your infrastructure awareness should

251
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:35,354
be. Hope this short data

252
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,744
center infrastructure tool was useful. If you are

253
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:42,312

254
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:45,888
free cooling, you are always welcome to contact me directly
