00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,380
Hey, good morning. Good afternoon everyone. My name is Prateek Dhantra Day.

2
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:35,592
I'm a principal software professional working

3
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:39,200
with one of the leading human capital management companies in the

4
00:00:39,232 --> 00:00:42,440
US. And I'm active researcher

5
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:45,044
in the field of DevOps,

6
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:48,564
artificial intelligence, machine learning and security.

7
00:00:49,304 --> 00:00:52,888
I'm excited to be here at CoN 42 observability

8
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:56,376
conference to discuss the important topic today of

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,888
forging secure and

10
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:03,624
observable DevOps using AI

11
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:07,364
ML. And as we know that DevOps

12
00:01:07,704 --> 00:01:11,400
is growing exponentially and in

13
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:15,480
parallel it raises a concern to maintain the

14
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:18,244
security and the observability.

15
00:01:18,624 --> 00:01:22,920
It's becoming a challenge today and but

16
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:27,088
the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning

17
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:30,768
is a true game changer to help

18
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:34,296
in the DevOps. And today in my presentation I'm going

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,128
to talk about more into this detail.

20
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:40,004
So let's get dive into my presentation.

21
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:48,164
So let's start with the DevOps evolution.

22
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:52,584
DevOps has revolutionized how we deliver

23
00:01:52,964 --> 00:01:56,644
the software, breaking down silos between the development and

24
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:00,144
operations. It's enabled us to deploy

25
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:03,980
much faster and more frequent with

26
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:07,828
this greater reliability. But as the system scale

27
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:11,180
and it becomes more distributed, the traditional

28
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:14,264
DevOps practices are being stretched to their limits.

29
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:18,368
Today, the DevOps environments are spread

30
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:22,368
ecosystem like microservices, serverless functions,

31
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:26,312
containers and cloud services all interacting

32
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:30,344
in the integrate way. And this complexity

33
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:33,600
makes it daunting to maintain the comprehensive

34
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:37,324
visibility and ensure the robust security.

35
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:41,488
So question should come like how do we monitor each and every component

36
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,648
and how we detect the threats

37
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:47,194
across this dynamic landscape.

38
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:52,246
This is where the power of artificial intelligence

39
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,334
and machine learning comes into picture. And this reshape

40
00:02:56,374 --> 00:03:00,134
our approach to DevOps. So by harnessing

41
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:03,934
this AI ML, we can elevate our observability and

42
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:08,006
threat detection capabilities to match and scale

43
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,394
the dynamism of the modern software system.

44
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:17,334
Now let's talk about the observability.

45
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:23,274
So in today's DevOps world, we are generating

46
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:27,254
lot of data in terms of logs, matrices,

47
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,534
traces from the countless services.

48
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:34,666
All the significant amount of data are produced every second.

49
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,882
And this is the place where AI shines.

50
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:42,650
And machine learning models can identify these patterns and

51
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:46,170
go correlations that human analysts would miss.

52
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:50,090
And take a anomaly detection for instance,

53
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:53,450
like traditional rule based method often fails in

54
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:57,042
the dynamic environment. But machine learning models can

55
00:03:57,138 --> 00:04:00,786
learn what's the normal across various metrics

56
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,890
and flag deviation in the real time. This is not

57
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:08,874
just about the cpu spike, it's about detecting

58
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:12,506
multidimensional anomalies like unusual API call

59
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,146
patterns that might indicate a data bridge

60
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,010
or a bad actor. Take your

61
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:23,514
data so AI can transform this root cause

62
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:27,234
analysis. When an incident occurs, it's often

63
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:30,354
a complex chain of event. The machine

64
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:34,450
learning techniques like casual interference and

65
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:38,076
the graph analysis can navigate this complexity,

66
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,824
tracing issues and back to the source.

67
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:44,996
Imagine quickly pinpointing this database. Slowdown is due

68
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,724
to the network misconfiguration are

69
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:52,100
like three hops away and that's the power of AI driven

70
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:53,064
observability.

71
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:59,064
Now let's talk about security.

72
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:02,444
So in DevOps,

73
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:06,604
speed cannot come at the cost of safety.

74
00:05:06,904 --> 00:05:10,752
Yet in the traditional security models like with their fixed

75
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:14,416
rules and manual processes struggle to keep the

76
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,936
pace. But this is where the machine learning becomes DevOps

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,924
security multiplier. Consider a threat detection

78
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:27,126
ML model excel identifying

79
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,098
this subtle like evolving the attack patterns. By analyzing

80
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:35,218
vast data set of the network traffic systems,

81
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:39,074
logs and user behaviors, this model

82
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:42,690
can spot signs of intuition that

83
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:46,414
signature based tool might have missed and

84
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:50,626
they adopt this models adopt in the real time

85
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,378
and learn the new threat indicators as they

86
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:58,510
emerge. And AI also transform like vulnerability

87
00:05:58,622 --> 00:06:02,742
management. In this world of continuous deployment,

88
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:06,470
your attack surface is always changing and machine

89
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:10,234
learning algorithms can continuously scan your infrastructure

90
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:14,918
assessing like new components predictive do.

91
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:18,750
They do predictive analysis to forecast like which part of your system

92
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:20,874
are most likely to be targeted.

93
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:25,728
And this is how help the organization to prioritize

94
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:29,744
their defenses. Another game changer

95
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:33,296
is AI driven threat modeling. Traditionally this

96
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,720
is a manual and time consuming task. But now

97
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:40,672
like we have a machine learning system that can automatically

98
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:44,832
map your application architecture, identify data flows and

99
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,924
pinpoint the potential attack vectors.

100
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:52,296
They even suggest mitigation based on the

101
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,564
pattern learned from the countless other systems.

102
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,994
Now let's talk about the two most important

103
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:07,074
practices like intelligent monitor and genetic psychops

104
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:10,950
research. So let me

105
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:14,074
start with the genetic algorithm.

106
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:18,982
So this is one of the most exciting innovation in

107
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:23,078
the application of genetic algorithm in secops like

108
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:27,274
genetic algorithm inspired by the natural selection

109
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:31,036
which are the powerful tool for the optimizing

110
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,476
problem. Like in our work. Like if we are using

111
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,820
them to enhance our automated security testing drastically.

112
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:43,348
First like we are using this genetic

113
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:47,304
algorithm to generate diverse and challenging test cases.

114
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:51,580
Just as a genetic variation in nature leads to the

115
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:55,406
adaptability our a genetic algorithm creates

116
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,454
a wide array of test scenarios and from unusual

117
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:03,114
API call which sequences to

118
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:08,894
complex race conditions and this

119
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:12,094
diversity helps to uncover vulnerabilities

120
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:16,194
that predefined the test suite might miss.

121
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:20,354
But this genetic algorithm truly shine

122
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:25,024
in the optimizing our vulnerability detection tools.

123
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:28,636
False positive and negatives are the major pain

124
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,460
points in security testing. A high false

125
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:36,212
positive rate overwhelmed teams while false

126
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,932
negative live system exposed. So each

127
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:43,908
algorithm parameter things like pattern

128
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:47,840
matching rules or anomaly threads are this

129
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:51,728
like genes. We run this algorithm against a data

130
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:55,592
set of known code or known backbone sample

131
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:59,088
and those that correctly

132
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:02,424
identify vulnerabilities while minimizing

133
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:05,656
the false alarm which are considered fit.

134
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,864
And through the process of mirroring, crossover and mutation,

135
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:13,642
we evolve this algorithm over thousands

136
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:17,258
of generations. And the results are

137
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,586
really remarkable. Like our genetic algorithm optimized

138
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,242
tool show a 30% reduction in false positive

139
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:28,394
and the 25% improvement in detecting

140
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,014
the noble vulnerabilities compared to

141
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:36,178
old solutions. This means our devsecops,

142
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:40,194
which is like a dev operations with security

143
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:45,034
spend less time on noise and have a greater confidence

144
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:50,366
in the security posture. Now let's

145
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,794
discuss about the intelligent monitor.

146
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:57,446
So while observability gives

147
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,142
us the visibility into the system behavior,

148
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:05,050
the future is intelligent monitoring, where AI

149
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:08,734
doesn't just watch, but understand and act.

150
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:13,054
This engine uses the deep learning techniques,

151
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:17,650
specifically like long short term memory,

152
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:21,210
which is LSTM networks, to understand the

153
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:25,538
narrative of your system operations. So this LSTM

154
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:29,442
are excellent at learning the sequences,

155
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:33,568
which makes them perfect for grasping the flow of the event

156
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:38,504
in the distributed systems. And we

157
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:42,364
use application tools like new relic app dynamics,

158
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:46,080
which have the stream of logs, metrics and traces.

159
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:49,792
But our LSTM models learn

160
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:54,848
the story, the events of those logs, and based

161
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:58,732
on the past incident. And now this new

162
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,420
telemetry comes in. This engine doesn't

163
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:06,020
just see the data points, it comprehends the

164
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:09,764
unfolding narrative. So understanding

165
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:13,664
is only the half battle. But cognitive

166
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:17,972
ops engine also uses the gen AI,

167
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:21,420
just like GPT-3 to,

168
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:25,514
you know, create the responses. So when it detect

169
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:29,758
an emerging issues, it just doesn't alert it.

170
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:33,134
It generates a tailored playbook, like a natural

171
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:36,954
language for a potential database deadlock.

172
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:42,198
It might say. I'm seeing a pattern similar to enrollment

173
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:46,814
search like last year, considering raising a connection limit and retrying

174
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:50,990
transaction. And here is the exact command, something like

175
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:54,356
that. It's like a generative AI

176
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,892
response. So moreover, like our engine

177
00:11:57,948 --> 00:12:01,260
continuously refines its knowledge using a

178
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:04,052
technique called experience replay.

179
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:08,124
From reinforcement learning, it revisits the

180
00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:11,372
past incidents, learning which

181
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:15,548
actions were most effective. And so it's not just monitoring,

182
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:18,906
it's. It's an AI operation expert that

183
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,694
grows wiser with every challenges that it faces.

184
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:28,034
So now let's talk about the

185
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:31,610
artificial intelligence in the devsecops lifecycle.

186
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:35,802
So as we embrace like AI in the DevOps,

187
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:39,882
we must navigate challenges thoroughly. Like ML models

188
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:43,956
are only as good as their training data,

189
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,648
but biased or incomplete data set can lead to

190
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:51,064
missed threats or false positive. So we

191
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,896
need diverse and well curated training data to represent the

192
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,240
full spectrum of this DevOps scenarios.

193
00:12:58,392 --> 00:13:02,336
So there is also a black box problem.

194
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,024
Like many AI system, especially like deep learning models,

195
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:09,456
they are like OpEC in the decision making.

196
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,056
In the security critical Devsecov task,

197
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,196
the lack of explainability is concerning. We must

198
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,868
prioritize interpretable AI techniques that

199
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:24,500
show their reasoning or and that's how you're building the

200
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:28,676
trust with the DevOps teams. So ethical

201
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,900
consideration also loom large

202
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:35,308
here. So AI power to analyze

203
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,916
a system and user behavior raises a privacy concern.

204
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,780
So we must implement techniques like differential

205
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:46,278
privacy to ensure our observability

206
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:49,854
tools don't compromise personal data.

207
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:54,298
Furthermore, like AI makes autonomous decision

208
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:58,178
in our DevOps pipeline and we need

209
00:13:58,226 --> 00:14:01,386
to robust governance to

210
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,130
ensure it aligns with our organization values

211
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:08,922
and it does not harm any reputation

212
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:12,878
of the organization. So now

213
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:16,478
let's talk about the DevOps devsecops best

214
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:19,670
practices. So now we stand at

215
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:23,246
this juncture. Like the fusion of AI ML with the

216
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,222
DevOps is not just promising, it's becoming essential.

217
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:31,034
Like in this era of cloud native

218
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:35,182
global distributed system, maintaining security

219
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,622
and observability is like too complex for a traditional methods.

220
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:43,464
But AI and ML provide this capability and

221
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:47,676
adaptability and it insights

222
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,340
that we need. But like this

223
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:55,796
journey also requires continuous learning and collaboration.

224
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,420
Like DevOps professional must upskills in the

225
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:02,772
AI ML concept and data scientists must understand

226
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:07,228
the DevOps workflows, security expert

227
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:11,572
must guide the ethical application for these technologies and cross

228
00:15:11,628 --> 00:15:15,232
functional teamwork is also our

229
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:17,284
path to the DevOps future,

230
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:21,840
you know. So in conclusion,

231
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:25,608
I would say the integration of AI

232
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:28,840
and ML learning

233
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:32,568
into DevOps

234
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:36,360
is not a distinct version, it's like an evolution

235
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:41,712
of happening now. And this

236
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:45,416
genetic algorithm optimizing our security

237
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,376
tools to LSTM understand our

238
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,920
system narratives. So there are

239
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:56,112
some challenges that we need to navigate

240
00:15:56,168 --> 00:16:00,576
like data quality, model interpretability

241
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,304
and ethical use. But potential rewards are immense.

242
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:08,020
Like DevOps environment are

243
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,556
self monitoring, self defending and it aligns

244
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,996
with the human values. So to

245
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,076
further extend this like maybe if I

246
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,724
would like to put like three

247
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:26,732
points, significantly expand expanding your

248
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:30,612
key research area. One should be like devsecops which

249
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:34,744
is like added concrete examples of your AI driven

250
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:39,492
devsecops platform showcasing how it uses NLP

251
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:43,020
and reinforcement learning to enhance the

252
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:45,424
security without slowing down the development.

253
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:49,780
The second is like genetic algorithm which is

254
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:53,624
like elaborated to your use of

255
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:57,844
GA like genetic algorithm in Sec Ops,

256
00:16:57,924 --> 00:17:01,504
explaining how you use them to generate

257
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:07,386
diverse test cases and more importantly to evolve from accurate

258
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,894
vulnerability detection algorithms.

259
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:15,418
Lastly, like we need the intelligent monitor which

260
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:18,858
introduced our cognitive Ops engine which

261
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:22,906
uses long term short term memory network to understand

262
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,738
the system behavior, narratives and the generative AI

263
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:30,646
to provide the human readable responses.

264
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,414
So all of this additions not only just provide the

265
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,766
technical depth, but also highlight

266
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,126
applying this edge cutting AI to

267
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,494
DevOps technology and collaboratively

268
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:49,554
like we can shaping a secure digital future.

269
00:17:51,174 --> 00:17:53,294
So that's all I have. Thank you.
