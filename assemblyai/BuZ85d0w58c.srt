00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,990
Welcome to my talk principium diving into the quantum

2
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:30,524
hardware ecosystem and today we are going to

3
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:33,932
look into the quantum hardware picture that is there

4
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,316
and what quantum hardware means, what are the different global

5
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,668
scenarios that we are looking into and what the current

6
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:45,292
and the future of indian quantum ecosystem looks like and what

7
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:48,948
are the different use cases that we will be going through. So moving forward

8
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:51,744
with the topic and the talk today.

9
00:00:52,124 --> 00:00:55,766
So before we dive deep, I'll just give

10
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,646
a brief intro. About me so my

11
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,462
name is architect Shavastava and I have been fortunate enough

12
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:07,514
to found ATM along with my colleague,

13
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:11,854
which is a quantum hardware community focused on improving

14
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:15,926
and spreading knowledge about what the quantum hardware is.

15
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,710
And I have also in my college

16
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:22,394
days founded Circuit Quantum Research.

17
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,140
In my college which was RV College of Engineering and in quantum

18
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:30,684
Computing India, I, along with few of my colleagues,

19
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:34,020
we were fortunate enough to found the

20
00:01:34,172 --> 00:01:37,676
quantum hardware learning circles that were there over there. I also worked

21
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,444
on various use cases and various topics

22
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:44,812
and it is a very good platform where we can learn a lot

23
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:48,684
of things. In my final year of college,

24
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:52,526
I was the quantum computing intern at Bose one QSI Private Limited.

25
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,562
Currently the company is one of the leading firms in quantum simulations

26
00:01:56,698 --> 00:02:00,194
in CFT field. I am also

27
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:04,298
a quantum evangelist at Inaugurus where I

28
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:08,254
am working on the GKQCTP project and

29
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:12,666
how it can help India in the coming

30
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,706
years. And currently I am working as a senior technical consultant

31
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,326
at zero nine Solutions, Bangalore, Karnataka.

32
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,326
And personally I'm more interested in solving

33
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,874
use cases of quantum computing where we can

34
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:30,470
look into how to integrate quantum computing in the

35
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:34,542
areas of astronomy astrophysics if we look at the

36
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:38,262
motivation of the topic. So there is a lack

37
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:42,014
of knowledge about quantum hardware ecosystem and the need for growth in the domain.

38
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:46,800
And we need to increase and

39
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:50,088
spread awareness about various topics related to quantum computing

40
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,816
hardware. And there is an immediate need for people to indulge in the

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,616
development of quantum hardware to realize effective quantum computing solutions in future.

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,880
Because without effective quantum hardware solutions,

43
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:05,224
we cannot essentially look at having optimized quantum

44
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:09,424
software solutions also. So looking at today's

45
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:12,916
contents, what we have is first we'll

46
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,516
look into the introduction of quantum hardware,

47
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,780
then we'll have a global picture, then how the indian landscape looks,

48
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:22,744
and we'll also look at the different use cases that are there.

49
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:26,924
So a brief, not so brief introduction

50
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:30,660
about what the quantum hardware is. So when we talk

51
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:34,012
about quantum hardware, people think that this is a quantum computer and this is

52
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:37,164
the only hardware, but this actually is

53
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:42,022
not the only picture that we have. So this

54
00:03:42,118 --> 00:03:45,446
is a relatively bigger picture if we see here, this is

55
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,070
what the scale looks like. So we have the qubit signal amplifier here,

56
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:52,998
the input microwave lines, the superconducting coil

57
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:56,982
lines, also the cryogenic insulators, quantum amplifiers.

58
00:03:57,118 --> 00:04:01,494
This is the mixing chamber that we have here and various

59
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:04,230
other components like cryogenic shields and everything.

60
00:04:04,302 --> 00:04:09,394
And we have various temperature gradation

61
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:13,162
happening also. So as we move down the dilution

62
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:17,562
refrigerator, the temperature decreases. And at

63
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:21,026
the bottom of the contraption we

64
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,454
have the qubit sitting where the temperature is nearly ten millikelvin.

65
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:29,410
So I don't think it will be fair enough if I call this

66
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:33,044
as the complete picture that we have right now.

67
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:37,480
If you look at the bigger picture more. So this is what a

68
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:41,408
quantum computer mostly looks like. So this

69
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:45,080
was the thing that we think is a quantum computer.

70
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:48,992
But actually this whole picture is what

71
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,672
the quantum computer comprises of. So we have the

72
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:56,816
qubit at the lowest end. We have amplifiers,

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,754
we have microwave electronics, we have the software

74
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:06,530
solutions also. And various,

75
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:09,778
various things that we can have,

76
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:13,226
we have here. So there

77
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,074
are different readouts, there is computation going on.

78
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,882
And a lot of things happen when we send signal and we receive

79
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:24,916
signal and how the circuits are connected.

80
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,216
It is not just the dilution refrigerator or

81
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,416
the picture that we generally see of a quantum computer,

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,408
which can be called as a quantum computer. But according

83
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:40,160
to me, this is what the whole picture of a quantum computer

84
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:44,016
looks like. What is under the hood of a quantum computer,

85
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,336
you have. First we have the user interfaces. As we

86
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,640
saw in the previous diagram. There are quantum algorithms and applications,

87
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:54,640
logic level compilation, circuit optimizations happening, quantum error

88
00:05:54,672 --> 00:05:58,208
corrections, hardware optimizations, and various

89
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:02,104
stuffs happening. Along with quantum firmware, which is

90
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:06,024
called as the hardware error mitigation, we have various

91
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:08,936
things on that level and the physical qubit hardware that we have.

92
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,464
Finally, a generic quantum

93
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:16,400
classical interface. How it looks like is the quantum

94
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:20,264
classical interface involves several key elements required for

95
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:23,718
quantum computing, control and readout subsystems.

96
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:28,578
So these systems are distributed between

97
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:31,534
the room temperatures at 100 milli kelvin.

98
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:36,054
And so as we saw that

99
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,642
the temperature decreases as we go down. And we

100
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:45,050
also have a readout transceiver equipped with an integrated field programmable

101
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:48,786
array or FPGA. And there are various D

102
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,786
two cs ADC's, which allows a simultaneous readout

103
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,186
of multiple qubits. We also have a cryogenic CMos

104
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,826
brown chip that addresses the input output bottleneck

105
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,594
that is there. And we also have various

106
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:06,978
qubit test platforms that are there and qubit planes,

107
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:10,506
readout multiplexings. We have various applications,

108
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,666
quantum algorithms error corrections happening here, along with qubit control and

109
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,210
the classical computer. And we have controlled

110
00:07:18,242 --> 00:07:21,998
readouts along with the routing and I O management

111
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:24,486
and readout multiplexing is also happening.

112
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,510
And at the bottom, we have the quantum chip

113
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:31,854
that is there. So if we look at the circuit diagram

114
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:35,590
also. So it looks something like this that we have read out resonators,

115
00:07:35,782 --> 00:07:39,646
read out transceivers, read out control. We have a DAC.

116
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,422
And as we move down, the temperature starts

117
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:47,278
dropping. And this is a picture

118
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:50,366
what is happening on a very granular level that is

119
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,766
there. So if we move forward with the

120
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,310
talk, what we have here is how

121
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:01,918
the quantum computer looks. So if we look

122
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:06,366
specifically at the dilution refrigerator. So, we have various

123
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,430
parts like quantum amplifiers, cryogenic shields, quantum signal amplifiers,

124
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:14,170
input microwave lines, and in

125
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,674
a general or a very bird's eye view picture,

126
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:21,050
what we have here is the. The things that are happening

127
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:24,498
in various quantum computing fields are the quantum computing theory

128
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,934
that happens on the quantum complexity theory and the quantum algorithms.

129
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:33,202
In the quantum programming, we have this layer.

130
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:36,994
And in the quantum computing architecture, we have the system organizations

131
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:40,366
and Quantum Microsoft architectures. We have

132
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,902
the QVC and FT implementations, classical control interconnections,

133
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,622
topologies and floor plannings, technology building

134
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:50,758
blocks, which are the qubit interconnect technologies,

135
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:52,994
qubit storage and gate technologies.

136
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:58,134
So there are various qubit

137
00:08:58,174 --> 00:09:01,142
architectures that we can look. And this,

138
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:03,994
personally, are my three favorite illustrations,

139
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:08,260
beautifully drawn by my colleague Abhir Vaishnav.

140
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:11,932
So, superconducting qubit, trapdance and photonic, these are

141
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:15,500
very common architectures. And there are various architectures that we

142
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:18,740
may look into. So if we look into

143
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:22,508
the superconducting qubit, that's that we have

144
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:26,356
here. So this is what a superconducting

145
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,382
qubit looks like. And we have resonators. We have.

146
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:34,282
So, in this picture, we currently have five

147
00:09:34,338 --> 00:09:37,770
qubits and qubit one, qubit two. So these are various qubits.

148
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:40,894
And there are resonators in between for.

149
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:44,866
And there are. There are lines for input

150
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,282
and output that we can have. And this is a picture of

151
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:51,282
the condor chip that IBM announced,

152
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:55,986
and it has 1021

153
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:02,452
qubits that are there. And on a very bird's

154
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:06,704
eye view scale, this is what the qubit architecture looks like.

155
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:11,356
If you talk about the iron trap qubit

156
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,244
architecture, we use laser beams to control ions. To address the two arbitrary ions

157
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:18,892
in the string of trapped ions. It can be done with

158
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:22,148
beams, the red ones that we have here. And this method

159
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:25,652
can entangle two arbitrary qubits on the string of ions that are

160
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:29,752
there. The basic principle that goes

161
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:33,400
are the entanglement and superposition of the qubit.

162
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,744
So, this is how we realize an ion trap qubit.

163
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:41,644
So if we look into another simplified

164
00:10:43,864 --> 00:10:47,304
model of a compact ion trap quantum computer demonstrator.

165
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:50,968
So, this actually is a simplified scale

166
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:55,016
model of the quantum computing demonstrator, housed into an

167
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,992
18 inch racks, which are there.

168
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:02,024
And the modules in the red correspond to the optical systems

169
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:06,592
that we have. And in the green, what we have is for the communications

170
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:10,272
and the readout. The blue is the electronics and amplifier is yellow is

171
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:14,112
the fiber routing and switching. And the purple is for miscellaneous of

172
00:11:14,128 --> 00:11:17,480
the core module. So what we see here is

173
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:21,324
basically a concept of a compact antwrap

174
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:25,030
computer demonstrator. And this is from

175
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:28,750
the. From a paper named as the compact ion trap quantum computing

176
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:32,174
demonstrator. And it is a very good paper to get an

177
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:35,518
idea about the concept moving

178
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:38,874
forward. We also have the photonic qubit

179
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:44,294
that we have. So, in photon. Photonic quantum computing architecture,

180
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:48,878
photons are basically used as the basic blocks,

181
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:52,856
building blocks of a quantum computer. And, uh, photons are basically,

182
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,704
uh, entangled and, uh, sent into superposition. And the,

183
00:11:56,744 --> 00:12:00,760
uh, readout results, um, are then, um, checked and,

184
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:04,524
um, maintained. And various quantum computing

185
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,924
solutions are also realized using a photonic qubit.

186
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:13,040
So. And the photonic qubits are

187
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:16,832
also relatively easier to realize than

188
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:19,958
the class, than the classical, uh,

189
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:23,614
superconducting architecture, which is very popular around.

190
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:27,962
So, if we move towards the global picture, how the

191
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:31,134
global picture is looking for the. For the quantum hardware.

192
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:35,370
So, the current global quantum computing market

193
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:38,654
is approximately valued as at $500 million,

194
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:43,466
which was in 2021. It is

195
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,734
expected to reach nearly $1.7 billion by 2026.

196
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:51,824
And the major investments are happening from the tech giants like IBM,

197
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:56,232
Google, and Microsoft, and significant

198
00:12:56,328 --> 00:13:00,136
government fundings and private sectors. Investments are happening worldwide,

199
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,784
along with rapidly growing interest from sectors like finance, healthcare and logistics.

200
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:07,344
And these are not the only sectors that are attracting quantum computing

201
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:11,016
investments that can happen. So, if you

202
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,720
look at the picture of what the quantum computing

203
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,914
companies look like, uh, these are, uh,

204
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:22,614
only the 102 companies that are shaping the quantum computing landscape.

205
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:26,606
And it actually is, um, like just 102.

206
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,926
And it is a very, uh, dynamic and, uh,

207
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,070
continuing, constantly developing area there.

208
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:36,142
We are having a lot more companies popping up

209
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:39,662
on a daily basis. Uh, so we can have a very, um,

210
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:43,630
uh, like, bird's eye view of what different companies

211
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:48,542
are working on different technologies. So we have superconducting photonics

212
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:52,022
across industry and various companies, and we can see very

213
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,254
big, big names also over here, and very new

214
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,710
players also that currently are

215
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:01,754
working rigorously in the domain.

216
00:14:02,454 --> 00:14:05,874
So if we look at how the

217
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:09,486
current global market for the quantum computing is look

218
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:14,386
like, so quantum hardware specifically is marketed,

219
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,978
is valued at 300 million

220
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:22,498
and it is projected to grow at 1.3 billion by 2027.

221
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:26,266
And there is an increasing competition

222
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,906
from startups and event trends. And if

223
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,514
we see the quantum computing global market to increase on a daily

224
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:36,666
basis, and there are a

225
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,938
lot of investments happening and a lot of innovations happening

226
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:44,626
regularly, and if we look,

227
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,866
what will be the long term benefits, we ask is

228
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,738
the enhanced computational power which

229
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:55,882
we get from these quantum computers are

230
00:14:55,978 --> 00:15:00,106
driven to innovation and economic growth of any country that

231
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,890
follows it. It accelerates advancements in AI,

232
00:15:03,922 --> 00:15:06,954
cryptography and material science. It attracts high tech investments,

233
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:10,880
talents in boosting GDP, thus increasing the employability

234
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:14,680
in any country, and strengthens national security through

235
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:18,240
advanced encryption and defense capabilities. Because quantum

236
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:21,600
computing in a very generic sense is very vast.

237
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,712
And quantum cryptography, as mentioned above, is one of the key

238
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:28,752
areas where a lot of development is happening globally,

239
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:34,176
and it will increase the security landscape

240
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,870
drastically that we can have, and it promotes leadership

241
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:41,790
in the global tech landscape also, and along with various international collaboration.

242
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:45,714
So it is not only if a country is developing the

243
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:50,634
quantum computer or the quantum hardware ecosystem,

244
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:55,030
but it happens based on how things

245
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:59,634
are looking and how intercontinental or intercountry

246
00:15:59,974 --> 00:16:04,234
relationships work. And it increases

247
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:07,768
the level of technology

248
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:11,128
that we have. And any country that is

249
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:15,336
investing in also increases the

250
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,032
chances of better inflow of technologies

251
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:23,444
amongst them. And if now

252
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:27,344
we look at how the future looks like. So the expected

253
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:30,612
market size of quantum computing is 2.5 billion by

254
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:34,124
2030. There is a continued exponential

255
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:37,764
growth in the R and D investments, increased partnership between academia,

256
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:42,076
industry and government, and rapid improvements in qubit scalability and

257
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,492
stability, broadening application areas

258
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:49,564
like healthcare, finance and climate modeling. And the

259
00:16:49,604 --> 00:16:54,988
quantum computing, like very various

260
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:59,752
fields that we have in major mega

261
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:04,524
science projects along the globe, is a

262
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:10,152
intersection between academia, industry and government. And quantum computing

263
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:14,240
for any nation cannot be realized without

264
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:18,440
the interaction and involvement of all these three together.

265
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:23,308
So it is a very holistic

266
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:27,188
space where all the three come together and develop

267
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:29,344
the whole country together.

268
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:33,868
And looking more

269
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:37,460
at India. So how the indian landscape

270
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:41,748
looks currently is the India

271
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:45,236
is coming out as a key player in the strategic investments

272
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,260
for quantum computing, and national quantum missions

273
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:53,444
and technologies and initiative that

274
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:58,520
government is promoting is actually helping the ecosystem

275
00:17:58,552 --> 00:18:02,244
to grow a lot. And a lot of startups are coming on a

276
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:06,688
very regular basis, and resource institutions and academia collaborations

277
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:10,880
is increasing along with industry and the startup ecosystem that is existing in India.

278
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:14,536
And there is a focus more on quantum cryptography,

279
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,466
simulations and AI applications of India because it

280
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,954
serves as the need for the r for the development of various

281
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:25,594
other technologies in India at various scales

282
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:29,254
and for other future technologies for the quantum computing field.

283
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:33,818
Government is supporting various R and D projects,

284
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:37,306
R and D initiatives, assigning budgets

285
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,174
and fundings and development of skills in quantum technologies.

286
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:46,724
We also have so, uh, these are

287
00:18:47,464 --> 00:18:51,728
very like one of the places

288
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,484
where and institutions,

289
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:58,480
communities, college groups which are promoting quantum computing

290
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,432
at various levels and both professionally in academia,

291
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:05,560
in industry, and I'm really sorry

292
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:08,964
if I miss out on a lot of

293
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:13,648
new upcoming initiatives or

294
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:17,216
companies, and these are

295
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,684
very few of them which I could have a grasp of and

296
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:25,752
I'm really fortunate enough to have been part of a

297
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:29,616
few of them from this. So quantum Computing India boson

298
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,944
QSI Akum circuit in a gris kino Labs UPI

299
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:37,876
AI is C IIT Madras TIFR

300
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,460
and these are various quantum computing

301
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:45,064
communities, companies, college societies,

302
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:50,104
initiatives and colleges universities

303
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:54,900
which are day in and day out working together to bring

304
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:58,184
up the quantum computing and hardware ecosystem in India.

305
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:02,508
If we look at the National Quantum Mission which the Government

306
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:07,254
of India has initiated, so it is intended to invest approximately

307
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:11,682
8000 crores of indian rupees over five years, which is focused

308
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:15,818
on fostering research and development and deployment of quantum technologies focus

309
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:19,978
on quantum computing, communications and sensing applications, which will help

310
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:24,494
in development of skilled manpower and established quantum labs and test beds,

311
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:29,934
which will help position India as a global hub for quantum technologies and

312
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:34,056
innovation. And if

313
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,784
you look for future of India, so because of the heavy

314
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:41,336
investment of government of India and by

315
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,124
the help of national quantum Mission,

316
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:48,648
we are going to have an increased

317
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:52,880
ecosystem of quantum computing in future. And we

318
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:57,512
currently also see a lot of quantum computing initiatives

319
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:00,684
and companies coming up on a daily basis and

320
00:21:01,164 --> 00:21:05,540
they are fostering creating jobs in various areas.

321
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:09,140
Strategic partnerships with academic institutions and international quantum research

322
00:21:09,212 --> 00:21:12,468
centers are also in place and are happening on a

323
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:17,716
daily basis and they are increasing the academia

324
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,876
industry interactions that happen.

325
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,820
And there are a lot of emerging startups which are focusing on quantum hardware

326
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:29,258
development and it is expected to that

327
00:21:29,346 --> 00:21:32,698
the quantum computing market share of India will increase in

328
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:35,618
the future in the Asia Pacific region and also globally.

329
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:38,930
And India is anticipated to be

330
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:42,810
one of the biggest contributors in the quantum technology globally

331
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:46,130
by 2030 and focus on sectors

332
00:21:46,162 --> 00:21:49,890
like cybersecurity, health, finance is underway and

333
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:53,298
various projects are happening in India which are focusing on this

334
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:56,774
like cuno Labs and various other

335
00:21:57,114 --> 00:22:00,586
communities and companies working on it and

336
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,962
it aim, India aims to establish it as

337
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:07,294
a significant player in the quantum computing landscape that is there.

338
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:11,154
So if we move look at the various use cases that quantum

339
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:15,174
computing can address. So what we have with us is

340
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:19,354
a varied variety and an infinite amount of possibilities

341
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:23,258
that can happen. So we have protein folding, quantum chemistry,

342
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:26,770
design optimizations, supply chain inventory optimization,

343
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:30,314
disease risk predictions, finance modeling and portfolio optimization,

344
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:34,378
and various other. So these all areas

345
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:38,538
where quantum computing will be implemented based

346
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:41,930
on the quantum hardware that we, that we will be, we will be

347
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:46,114
having, will help in addressing various

348
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:49,662
scenarios and use cases in our daily

349
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:52,846
lives in the longer term, say 50 years or 100 years,

350
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,374
and achieve innumerable possibilities

351
00:22:56,454 --> 00:22:59,314
that we cannot even think of as of now.

352
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:03,314
And giving a brief about

353
00:23:04,494 --> 00:23:07,694
a very interesting topic. So this was my talk

354
00:23:07,814 --> 00:23:11,878
that I gave at CoN 42 last year, and its name was inignoitis.

355
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:16,294
And I tried to touch very

356
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:19,822
slightly on how quantum computing can be used in

357
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:23,542
the area of astrophysics. And this

358
00:23:23,638 --> 00:23:26,846
I presented as my

359
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,310
personal interest about how

360
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:32,834
it can be related to a very,

361
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:37,606
very different field and how it

362
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,662
can help in the development of that. So please

363
00:23:41,758 --> 00:23:44,994
check this talk out and if interested,

364
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:51,016
just reach, reach out to me on LinkedIn. And I

365
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,776
hope that this talk gave you some information about how

366
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,136
the quantum hardware ecosystem looks like and how what

367
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,096
quantum hardware actually is. And I

368
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,864
wish you a great day. Thank you.
