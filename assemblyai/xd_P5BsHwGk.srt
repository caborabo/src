00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,500
Hello everyone. Myself, giddy Prasad Manoharan. I work

2
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:34,180
for a company called Citibank Investment Banking

3
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:37,876
side as a senior artificial intelligence data

4
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,716
engineer. And here I'm going to talk about enhancing

5
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,252
banking security with artificial intelligence.

6
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:48,708
So here's the introduction of the banking security and AI.

7
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:52,384
So table of contents

8
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,384
enhancing banking security with hey,

9
00:00:55,544 --> 00:00:59,064
welcome to a pivotal exploration of how artificial

10
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:02,776
intelligence is transforming the landscape of banking security.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,084
As a financial crowd becomes more sophisticated and frequent,

12
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:11,648
the need for robust reduction and prevention

13
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:16,264
systems becomes crucial. Today, we will speak

14
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:20,304
about the innovative intersection of AI and

15
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:24,474
data engineering that is setting new standards in fraud management.

16
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:28,554
So, limitation of traditional fraud reduction systems

17
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:33,046
traditional fraud reduction systems are often constrained by

18
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,302
inadequate reduction rate of

19
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:41,310
percentage coupled with high false positive rates

20
00:01:41,382 --> 00:01:45,446
of approximately 30 percentage. These limitations

21
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,374
not only strain resources, but also compromise customer

22
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:53,438
trust and financial integrity. So data

23
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:57,206
engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing AI capabilities

24
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,958
and enabling the development of sophisticated data

25
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:04,718
pipelines. So these pipelines facilitate the real

26
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:08,318
time processing and analysis of vast transactional data

27
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:12,478
sets, achieving unprecedented processing

28
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:16,394
speeds and accuracy beyond conventional methods.

29
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:20,086
And although advanced feature engineering,

30
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,902
we effectively reduce data dimensionality and

31
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,198
transform it into a more refined format.

32
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:30,790
This process significantly improves

33
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:34,174
the quality of input data of

34
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:38,470
our A models, resulting in enhanced reduction

35
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:41,514
accuracy that reaches up to 90%.

36
00:02:44,194 --> 00:02:47,786
So improvement in a model accuracy.

37
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,894
Our optimized AI models demonstrate significant

38
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:55,922
advancements, resulting false positives by up to

39
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:59,574
25 percentage while maintaining high deduction sensitivities.

40
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:03,866
These enhancements ensure more reliable

41
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,574
and efficient fraud reduction systems.

42
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:12,422
Model interpret interpretability and scalability.

43
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:16,794
So this is very important for any A models, but in

44
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:20,582
financial it is more crucial. So a models need to be

45
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:24,094
interpretable and scalable, particularly in dynamic banking

46
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:27,614
environments because of the security and the high level

47
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:31,874
data is coming from the systems. So these qualities

48
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:36,116
ensure that our system are transparent to regulatory

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,052
bodies and adaptable to ever growing data volumes.

50
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:43,628
So this is the main thing. So leading financial institutions

51
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:47,548
have seen remarkable success with the integration

52
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:51,252
of our AI driven systems. Case studies

53
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:54,724
reveals reductions in fraud

54
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:58,388
occurrences by 40 percentage and substantial

55
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:01,724
improvement in operation efficiencies. So this is the case

56
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:05,776
study which follows very fact for customer trust.

57
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,216
So advanced fraud deduction systems are

58
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,664
pivotal in enhancing customer trust by

59
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:16,768
securing the financial environment with AI,

60
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:20,312
we provide customers with accuracy that their

61
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:24,056
assets are protected against increasingly sophisticated

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,552
threats. As I mentioned earlier. So all the data

63
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:31,152
sets which coming in investment banking side is more crucial,

64
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,302
so, so that we want to prevent

65
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:38,006
the data. So using AI techniques. So this

66
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,754
is the most crucial thing that we can do,

67
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:45,670
comprehensive guide and implementation.

68
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:49,894
So our discussion today serves as a comprehensive guide for

69
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:53,262
banking entities eager to implement cutting edge

70
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:56,718
AI and data engineering techniques in their fraud direction

71
00:04:56,766 --> 00:05:00,954
systems. We have outlined essential strategies and

72
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:02,654
implementation considerations,

73
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:08,738
so here is our conclusion on future outlook. In conclusion,

74
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:12,570
the integration of AI into banking security is

75
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:15,906
not just a trend, but a necessity in today's

76
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,282
digital age. Looking forward, the continued

77
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:23,210
evaluation of AI techniques promises even more

78
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,648
sophisticated and effective tools to combat financial

79
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:29,856
fraud. So thank you so much for

80
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,816
this opportunity. Hope you enjoyed my conversation.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,184
Thank you. Have a great day.
