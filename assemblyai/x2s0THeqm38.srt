00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,056
Good day, everyone. I am delighted to present to you today on

2
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,368
the topic of the elusive phase unravelling

3
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:36,280
quantum mysteries. This presentation will take you through

4
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:39,976
the fascinating journey of a phase operator for oscillators,

5
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,112
a concept that has puzzled scientists since the inception of

6
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:47,256
quantum theory. Describing the phase

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,824
of an electromagnetic field mode or a harmonic

8
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:54,542
oscillator has been an obstacle since since the early days of

9
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:58,086
modern quantum theory. We will explore the historical

10
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,606
context, starting from Dirac's phase operator

11
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,478
dilemma, and trace the breakthroughs and advancements leading

12
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:09,374
up to the modern formulations that are shaping our understanding

13
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:14,006
today. I hope you find this talk both informative and engaging.

14
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,014
Let's dive in. To begin with, let's set

15
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:21,978
the stage by introducing the concept of phase operators in

16
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:25,482
the context of quantum harmonic oscillators,

17
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:29,418
or what we call as Qho, which is a fundamental

18
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:32,954
model in quantum mechanics, representing a particle in a

19
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:36,890
potential well oscillating around an equilibrium

20
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:40,818
position. The phase operator is a crucial

21
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:44,626
in describing the phase of the oscillating system,

22
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,082
analogous to how phase is represented

23
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:50,354
in in a classical wave theory.

24
00:01:51,134 --> 00:01:54,886
Despite their importance, defining a proper phase

25
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,398
operator has been a challenge since the inception of

26
00:01:58,446 --> 00:02:02,102
quantum theory. Since Dirac's first attempt

27
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:05,350
in 1927, which is almost a

28
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:08,886
century ago, scientists have struggled to find a

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,646
suitable definition that resolves the various theoretical

30
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,314
issues. Understanding the phase operator is not just an

31
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:19,826
academic exercise. It has profound implications

32
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,642
for the field, such as quantum optics and quantum information

33
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:27,946
and computation as well. The journey to understand

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,386
phase operators is as old as quantum mechanics itself,

35
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,374
with significant contributions and obstacles along the way.

36
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:39,894
Let's delve into the details of this elusive operator, shall we?

37
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:44,678
In 1927, Paul Dirac made

38
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:48,430
the first significant attempt to define a phase

39
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,034
operator for a quantum harmonic oscillator.

40
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:57,166
Simple enough. He proposed a definition where the annihilation operator,

41
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,966
a hat, is expressed as the following expression that is

42
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,366
given right over here. So a hat is

43
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,770
equal to e to the power of I, phi hat, n hat to the power

44
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:10,970
of half. Here we have n

45
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:14,794
hat being the number operator and phi hat

46
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:18,054
being our very own phase operator.

47
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:21,922
An annihilation operator, just to give you a brief

48
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:25,562
introduction, is nothing but an operator which

49
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:29,394
acts on a state such that the number state

50
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:32,902
is reduced by one. This is a

51
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:35,954
common notation in the quantum harmonic oscillator.

52
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:40,094
I do not want to bore you with more details, so I will move on

53
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:43,926
from this point. So the problem with

54
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,438
this approach is that it encountered

55
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:51,102
some major issues. The term here, e to

56
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:55,634
the power of I phi hat, was found to be non unitary.

57
00:03:56,774 --> 00:04:00,162
That just means that it does not preserve the inner

58
00:04:00,218 --> 00:04:03,898
product of the Hilbert space itself, which is a fundamental

59
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:06,134
requirement in quantum mechanics.

60
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:10,034
Additionally, there were ambiguities in the expectation

61
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:13,826
values of the phase operator phi hat given here,

62
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,894
which means that it is very difficult to interpret this physically.

63
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:21,994
These problems highlighted the need for an

64
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:26,054
alternative approach to defining this quantum phase operator.

65
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:29,206
Enter Louise contribution.

66
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,594
Almost 50 years later,

67
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:36,350
William Louise in 1963 proposed

68
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:40,454
an alternative approach to tackle the issues left unresolved by

69
00:04:40,494 --> 00:04:44,582
Dirac's definition. To tackle the original problems

70
00:04:44,638 --> 00:04:48,478
encountered by Dirac, let us transform the

71
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:52,020
operator such that the inner product of the operator

72
00:04:52,142 --> 00:04:55,776
with the number states end up as unitary. Let the

73
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,844
operator become unitary is what he proposed.

74
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:02,824
He introduced the commutation relations for the cosine and

75
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:06,192
sine phase operators. Here we have the

76
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,848
commutator relations cos phi hat comma. The number

77
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:13,120
operator n hat is equal to I sine phi hat and

78
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:16,408
sine phi hat comma number operator n hat is equal to minus

79
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:19,892
I cosmic. Using this operation,

80
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:23,744
the phi hat has finally become a unitary operator.

81
00:05:24,484 --> 00:05:28,524
While this is a step forward, Louisa's approach

82
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:33,104
still did not yield a hermitian phase operator.

83
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:37,020
Hermitian operators are essentially in quantum mechanics

84
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:40,732
because they ensure that observable quantities

85
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:44,826
like phase have real eigenvalues,

86
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,754
meaning that it has real physical

87
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:52,074
correlation to the real world.

88
00:05:52,654 --> 00:05:56,990
The inability to define a hermitian phase operator continues

89
00:05:57,022 --> 00:06:01,182
to be a significant hurdle, necessitating further exploration

90
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,926
and new ideas. We move to a very

91
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,462
popular and a similar kind of idea given by

92
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:12,722
Suskind and Glorgover in 1964.

93
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:16,194
Just a year later, Leonard Suskind

94
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:19,962
and John Glogoer proposed a novel approach

95
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:23,954
by decomposing the annihilation operator in a different manner

96
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:27,098
from dynac. They defined cosine and sine

97
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:31,414
operators, the c hat and the n hat s hat.

98
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:34,854
So, based on this following relation,

99
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:39,494
where e hat is our electric field operator,

100
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:44,614
e hat is a one sided unitary shift operator.

101
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:49,294
They derive the commutator relations for the following operations.

102
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:53,642
C hat comma n hat is equal to my I side is

103
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:57,578
hat, and s hat comma, n hat is equal to minus ic

104
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,746
hat. Do you see the relations and the ideas building

105
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,446
from previous models being incorporated

106
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,118
in their model as well? This approach was

107
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:11,942
really innovative, but unfortunately it was still

108
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:16,474
imperfect. The cosine and sine operators did not commute

109
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:20,838
and thus they did not form a complete set

110
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:24,678
of phase variables, highlighting the

111
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:28,502
ongoing complexity of defining a proper

112
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:31,444
phase of operator in quantum mechanics.

113
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:36,024
Now we come to Carter's and Nieto,

114
00:07:36,144 --> 00:07:39,632
who further explored the properties of cosine and the sine

115
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:43,920
operators. Now what we call as the sg operators

116
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:48,144
standing for of course such kind and block over. They discovered

117
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:51,872
that their eigenvalues spectra are continuous in a particular

118
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:55,208
interval which is minus one to one. However,

119
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:59,342
they also found that these operators do not commute as shown

120
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:02,582
by the relation c hat s hat is equal to

121
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:06,966
one by two. I zero zero outer product

122
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,154
state. What does this zero zero actually mean?

123
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:15,798
So these are called as the number states and the number inside

124
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:20,086
represents the number of photons in the particular field at that time.

125
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,038
Here, zero photons basically mean vacuum and

126
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,870
what we are seeing is that the commutator relation leads to a relation

127
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:31,630
which directly computes to the outer product of the vacuum

128
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:36,430
states. This non commutative indicates

129
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:40,630
that a perfect phase operator satisfying all the desired

130
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:43,674
criteria are still eluding us.

131
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:49,074
Go another 20 years ahead to 1989,

132
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:53,674
in an attempt to overcome the issues faced by the earlier definitions,

133
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:57,488
Peg and Barnett introduced a novel approach.

134
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:01,320
They defined the phase operator as a finite dimensional

135
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:05,200
subspace of the Hilbert space as a whole, which allowed

136
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:08,604
for a more consistent mathematical framework.

137
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:13,120
Specifically, they used the definition in that the subspace

138
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:16,952
for the annihilation operator and expressed the exponential

139
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:20,286
of that phase operator as the following cyclic

140
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,374
summation. So here we have our phi hat

141
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:27,630
of the subspace being expressed as a

142
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:31,406
cyclic summation of all the number states up to

143
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,158
the state s, which is present in their particular chosen

144
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:38,614
subspace. Even this definition

145
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:41,790
looks very similar to Dirac's original definition,

146
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:45,498
and just see how the world is

147
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:49,854
very cyclic in nature. So specifically,

148
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:53,922
this approach, while effective in a finite

149
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:57,498
dimensional setting, becomes problematic as the

150
00:09:57,546 --> 00:10:01,082
dimension s approaches infinity, that is,

151
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:05,034
the whole Hilbert space. Nonetheless, it provides a

152
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:08,354
significant step forward in our understanding

153
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:10,774
of a quantum phase operator.

154
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:15,524
So it is clear to us at this point that

155
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:18,972
phase measuring experiments respond to various

156
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:21,584
constructed operators differently.

157
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:26,384
Let us build our own phase operator.

158
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,220
To determine the effectiveness of any proposed

159
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:34,092
phase operator, it is important to consider certain

160
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:38,040
desired properties. There are three properties

161
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:41,864
that every phase operator must have and which

162
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:44,564
we would consider as a valid phase operator.

163
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:48,312
The phase operator should be hermitian, that is,

164
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:50,924
phi dagger is equal to five.

165
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:54,844
Now this means that the eigenvalues which

166
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:59,084
corresponds directly to physical measurements.

167
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:03,924
Secondly, the trigonometric identity should hold

168
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:08,028
analogous to the classical case cos square phi hat

169
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:11,744
plus sine square phi hat should be equal to identity.

170
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:16,812
This, if violated, might not get commutative

171
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:20,804
operators. As seen before, the phase operator should

172
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:24,572
exhibit proper time dependence described here,

173
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:28,860
where omega is nothing but our frequency

174
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:31,570
of the oscillator and phi hat,

175
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:35,282
or at time t can be

176
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:38,618
directly represented with phi hat, with the initial phi

177
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:42,290
hat and omega times the time

178
00:11:42,362 --> 00:11:46,138
elapsed. Meeting these criteria is crucial for

179
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:50,362
the phase operator to be physically meaningful and mathematically

180
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:54,074
consistent. Now I just want

181
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,954
to talk about the recent advancements and applications.

182
00:11:58,074 --> 00:12:00,654
In the current recent years,

183
00:12:01,394 --> 00:12:04,482
where there have been significant advancements

184
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:08,014
in theoretical formulations of phase operators,

185
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:12,090
researchers have proposed new models that address some of

186
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:15,842
the historical challenges, such as maintaining hermesity,

187
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:20,050
ensuring consistent time dependency. These modern

188
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:23,778
formulations not only enhance our theoretical understanding,

189
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:27,890
but also have a practical application. For instance,

190
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:31,882
in quantum optics, accurate phase operators are

191
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:36,162
essential for precise control of the light fields

192
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:40,114
in various experiments. Additionally, in the realm

193
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:43,994
of quantum information, they play a critical role

194
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:47,914
in protocols for quantum communication and computation,

195
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,964
where phase coherence is crucial.

196
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:55,208
The journey to define a phase operator for

197
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:59,488
quantum harmonic oscillators has been both challenging and

198
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:03,288
enlightening. Starting from Dirac's initial attempts,

199
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:07,264
through the contributions of Loessel Saska and Logover

200
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:11,088
Carathis, we have made substantial

201
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:14,924
progress. However, the quest is far from over.

202
00:13:15,224 --> 00:13:17,204
Many open questions remain,

203
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:21,850
particularly regarding the extension of these concepts to

204
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:25,298
more complex quantum systems. Future research

205
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:29,554
will likely focus on resolving these issues and exploring new

206
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:32,694
applications in emerging quantum technologies.

207
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:36,682
I want to take this opportunity to thank you all for your attention,

208
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:40,866
and here I would like to conclude my presentation, and I

209
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,970
thank the hosts for giving me the opportunity for this talk. So thank

210
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:45,074
you.
