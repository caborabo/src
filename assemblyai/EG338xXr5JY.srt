1
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,062
Hey there. Hi. So, let's get

2
00:00:25,238 --> 00:00:28,502
started. So, my name

3
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:31,634
is Chetanya, and based out of London.

4
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:35,614
Today I'm gonna discuss the way,

5
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:39,558
how we leverage relentless marketing.

6
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:42,994
We're gonna discuss different aspects,

7
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:47,554
how do we measure conversion rates,

8
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:50,994
leverage data to do certain actions.

9
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:55,614
Uh, we're gonna understand the whole scenario. Many might

10
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:59,886
have had talks about people talking about building an

11
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,270
LLM or maybe fine tuning them.

12
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:08,590
Yeah, but those are concepts which are

13
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:12,478
around. But leveraging LLM

14
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:16,550
in marketing is something which I haven't thought of

15
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:20,810
before, according tweaked with AI and

16
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:24,954
stuff like that, and probably wanted to learn more

17
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:29,858
and then figured out there are ways where I can improve my marketing conversions

18
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:33,474
or bring in more revenue, understand more data

19
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:38,042
by using certain tools like Big ML or maybe

20
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:41,922
Amazon party. We're gonna discuss all of this, but let me deep dive

21
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:43,054
into this now.

22
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:49,154
So today's agenda,

23
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:53,830
we want to talk about introduction, a brief history,

24
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:57,526
introduction to web elements, the layers

25
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,302
of generative AI optimizing

26
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:05,038
metrics. How do we, how marketing change with AI,

27
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:08,398
building your own LLM with

28
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:11,804
Amazon party rock, and maybe other tools like that.

29
00:02:13,944 --> 00:02:16,564
So let's know each other a bit.

30
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:23,584
Yeah, think. Had a good understanding

31
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:27,976
of AI and things, and I was working with the company called Writesonic.

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,952
I don't know if you guys have heard of it, but it's one of

33
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:35,644
the fastest growing AI tech companies joining the company,

34
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:38,982
the initial first few employees.

35
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:42,718
It's. I didn't have any reference

36
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:46,702
on how to grow the product. Right. Since AI is a

37
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:51,166
new industry, we couldn't really understand

38
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,634
a lot of things. But, yeah, be made of me.

39
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:59,174
I was able to grow the company at a good scale, generating our

40
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:01,274
$9 million in about a year.

41
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:04,564
Previously to that,

42
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:10,136
it was mostly leading growth

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,904
marketing and product marketing functions in various tech

44
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,164
companies, mostly cybersecurity,

45
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:20,568
deep tech AI. Yeah, that's pretty

46
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,684
much partly,

47
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:25,484
yeah. Let's deep down now.

48
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:30,660
So what's an LLM? Right. I think

49
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:34,020
the different definitions and different

50
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:37,532
forms of LLM. But to keep it simple,

51
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:41,344
let's imagine LLM

52
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:46,504
as a bunch of data, bunch of unorganized,

53
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:49,940
unscattered data,

54
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:53,652
where it's sitting in a maybe, let's say something like

55
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:57,192
a Google Drive. Right. So how do

56
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:00,960
we leverage this data is by building a

57
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:04,720
problem set. It's building a solution and optimizing the

58
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:08,968
solution. So that's how I look at defining

59
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,544
an LLM. And there are different, like, fine tuning,

60
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:15,176
optimizing. We can do

61
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,232
100 different things. The core depends on how,

62
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:22,604
what data you have, how do you acquire the data

63
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:28,394
and what are the other forms of data?

64
00:04:29,254 --> 00:04:33,270
Yeah, probably database. Now we can look

65
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:36,670
at it, right. I think this is a key in

66
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:40,834
building in code LLm or the best LLM.

67
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:48,624
Now let's look at the layers of generative AI

68
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:52,252
and then like to understand the technology stack and.

69
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:56,300
Yeah, bits and buttons of it. So when you look at the layers of

70
00:04:56,332 --> 00:05:00,292
generative AI, you see applications fine tuning,

71
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:04,420
foundation models and infrastructure applications.

72
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:08,444
Right. So a drive sonic. We had our own

73
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:12,748
llm, which is open

74
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:16,196
sourced llm. We found shown that we released in a product

75
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,204
called as botsonic with an open API and people were able to use

76
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:23,772
it. So that's an application level

77
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:27,704
use of LLM and how we could use

78
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:31,388
buildings on top of an application or an API

79
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:35,484
using different tools and techniques. Then let's

80
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:39,028
look at fine tuning. Let's suppose we

81
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:42,796
have a data of next, which was not

82
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,824
really accurate. Maybe you're getting,

83
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:49,958
trying to give some input to it and output

84
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:53,926
is not what we are expecting. In the instance like that,

85
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,406
you try to fine tune things and you trying

86
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,142
to optimize things and you try to get more relevant

87
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,114
outputs.

88
00:06:05,494 --> 00:06:08,234
Next, let's go to the foundation models.

89
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:12,590
The market for the foundation models is really

90
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:16,194
huge. A lot of companies who are working on

91
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:19,794
fine tuning, pre training, optimizing these

92
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:23,414
models. So I would see

93
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:28,018
adopting decision models would change

94
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:32,418
before and after a few years. Think right

95
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:37,466
now we're at the pace where we're able to see more foundation

96
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,424
models with rapid data sets.

97
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:45,852
The last comes the infrastructure, like for

98
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:49,388
running this use, application, using OpenAI or whatever,

99
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:54,220
hugging phase and all of that. We need large

100
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,420
infrastructure. You heard about Nvidia, Nvidia going

101
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:02,180
into this direction. And probably all of this

102
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:06,336
needs a heavy lifting, probably a good retro lifting. That's what

103
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,724
I would do.

104
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:14,048
Let's go back and look at the technology step.

105
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:17,936
You see the technology at the current

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,184
state, I mean, not at the current state. Technology is

107
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:24,960
always evolving, right? And you see what you see today

108
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:28,240
and you don't see after a week or couple of

109
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:31,936
months. So, which means that we need to adapt according to it.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,390
Consider the amount of data and the amount of things

111
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:39,102
which we need to think through when you're building a

112
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:42,598
last language model. So now doubling that

113
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:45,814
every 3.45 to ten

114
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:48,902
months is, yeah,

115
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,678
pretty much a hard job. I've read

116
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:56,446
reports where the cost of carbon emissions and therefore the central

117
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,918
conditions we need to maintain the temperature in

118
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:04,236
the data centers. We need to make sure that

119
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,924
there are no halls with extensive emulsion

120
00:08:09,044 --> 00:08:12,708
of different, different emissions and keeping at the right

121
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:16,692
things in the right place is an important place in

122
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,864
an important place.

123
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:25,164
Now let's get into the actual customizing

124
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:28,874
market efforts through LMSFO visual engagement.

125
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:33,766
So when we look at, when we looked at how

126
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,134
do we leverage AI in our marketing efforts, right?

127
00:08:37,294 --> 00:08:41,046
So we're working with a company called as mixed panel, which was pretty much

128
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,454
has a more sophisticated technology and

129
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:48,406
they were able to pull out data and where I could search certain

130
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,118
things on how I wanted to see measure

131
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,260
things between. Usually at this point,

132
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:58,716
before the eye, we're able to go

133
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,116
to Google Analytics or pretty much other tools

134
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,972
like that, select a date and look at a conversion rate. Right?

135
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:09,644
But now we're able to ask tools, hey, what was my conversion

136
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:13,300
rate between this and this? What, what was my conversion

137
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:17,340
rate of an ad campaign? So to get more inaccurate,

138
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:21,444
accurate data with different forms of

139
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:27,304
data, similarly, we're able to measure things like conversion

140
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:30,444
rate or analysis and customer segmentation.

141
00:09:32,784 --> 00:09:36,736
Let's get a bit detail here. So let's

142
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,964
say conversion rate,

143
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:45,040
improving the conversion rate is where we use data to understand

144
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:49,554
what's working in. It's not working. Then we measure

145
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:54,366
this in form of ROI. Could be a payback period. Like I

146
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,194
spending to $100. How much time will I need to

147
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:02,198
keep running my campaigns to get hundred

148
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:05,670
dollars back? And how much profitability, when does my profitability

149
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:08,954
start? Takes three months. So that's what we do.

150
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:13,620
And then customer segmentation from the

151
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:17,028
customer segmentation using AI, we were able

152
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:20,460
to personalize segments of marketing,

153
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:24,692
personalized marketing strategies. I was able to personalize certain

154
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:28,268
campaigns where I know that, hey, this guy is from us,

155
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:31,784
this guy is from India, some other person is from UK.

156
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:35,144
And we're able to have different messaging

157
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:39,610
for all the different people, so on and so forth.

158
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:43,570
Yeah. And that was one of the key changing

159
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:47,234
things of personalization where

160
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:50,658
we could do so many things in terms of personalizing

161
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:54,306
with gifs, images. Yeah, I think the

162
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,774
world keeps going on there.

163
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:03,250
Use cases. So let's talk about the

164
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:06,702
use cases for marketing. So one thing we

165
00:11:06,718 --> 00:11:10,438
previously discussed, like searching for data, you have

166
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:14,334
one or two branch numbers, probably for me as

167
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:17,374
personal, I hate Excel. Yeah.

168
00:11:17,454 --> 00:11:20,702
Can manage with Google sheets and all of that, but probably not

169
00:11:20,718 --> 00:11:24,374
a big fan of Excel. Then there are

170
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:26,474
situations where I had to struggle,

171
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:30,726
use other tools and pretty much

172
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,460
it's a hard job for me, but with AI, I was able to

173
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:38,224
crunch numbers, create formulas, create calculations,

174
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:41,444
lot of things. So the tools like sheets,

175
00:11:41,524 --> 00:11:45,332
AI, which makes this job pretty easy. So kudos

176
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:46,664
to the makers.

177
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:52,708
Then let's talk about sales intelligence right here, you probably

178
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:57,660
seen tools like Gong, which were adaptable

179
00:11:57,732 --> 00:12:00,952
in terms of understanding what does it sell. So,

180
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:05,552
to give an instance, right, you could tell

181
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:08,884
a number, talk to a customer saying that, hey,

182
00:12:09,384 --> 00:12:12,672
I saw that you signed up on my website and I

183
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:15,484
wanted to understand more about what you're looking for.

184
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:19,848
Then Gong will understand his reactions

185
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:23,744
and analyze and understand

186
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:27,284
those, and gives you word cloud and

187
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:30,492
gives you the sentiment where you're doing better in

188
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:34,212
your pitch, where you're doing bad and compares with your other

189
00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:37,668
teammates calls. And that's probably what are we looking

190
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:42,076
at and how things are changing. Last one would

191
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,604
be data analytics, where from asking your

192
00:12:45,644 --> 00:12:49,212
customers what you're doing and start saying

193
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:52,580
why they do it. So you can see that,

194
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:56,770
hey, conversion rate improved of x, which means that this change,

195
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,054
which I made a week back, is coming today.

196
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:04,774
So use that for a similar way.

197
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:09,754
I mean, these are not the two or three use

198
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:13,466
cases. There are different use cases. It depends on how

199
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,574
we look at it and how we probably look at

200
00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:21,134
building it into our workflows and systems.

201
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:25,284
So let's. Now let's.

202
00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:29,656
So there's a tool called as bigml, where you can

203
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,136
load your own data and

204
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,536
analyze things, and there are different sources. It's a mix of

205
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,352
a machine learning model. You can also look

206
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:44,936
at building your own alum and analyzing and

207
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,136
building multiple distribution. Right. So I have different data

208
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,972
which have already uploaded in the past. So that's while

209
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:58,744
we do, we train some data and.

210
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:02,508
And also let's look at this one.

211
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,704
So if we go back,

212
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:17,444
oops,

213
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:28,112
yeah, this one. So how all

214
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:31,728
of these details where I can take

215
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:36,004
some different parameters, like add name, campaign name, placement optimization

216
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:40,124
into the consideration. Now,

217
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:44,694
multiple things. All the things which you see in an ad group.

218
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:49,054
Right. Now I also see this one,

219
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:06,090
CPa. I'm just putting weight

220
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:09,024
as three, create fusion,

221
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:33,384
some issue with that model. But let's get into this.

222
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:38,824
This is like, based on reviews, we're able to see

223
00:15:39,124 --> 00:15:43,124
the importance of a review or

224
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:48,024
54 instances. It shows me an error rate of 4.815

225
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:50,744
and unexpected error.

226
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:56,844
Now, this is one. Let's go

227
00:15:56,884 --> 00:16:09,048
to models.

228
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:15,176
And you have associations, topic models determine

229
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,124
this, but let's do this.

230
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:21,808
So this is another data set where

231
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:25,938
I wanted to figure out the branching

232
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:30,274
grouping of different keywords

233
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:34,354
in those ad campaigns, where top terms,

234
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:38,274
you can see the commercial terms like this,

235
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:42,874
and you can also see the probability,

236
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:47,274
rent and topic probabilities.

237
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:57,934
Now let's go to domain.

238
00:17:08,714 --> 00:17:10,054
Let me try again.

239
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:24,310
Yes, got it. So now I have

240
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:28,094
this amount of likes which generated repeat

241
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:31,566
followers. I can see the instances

242
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,750
of impressions and then how the overall

243
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:39,198
campaign is looking at it. Let's go

244
00:17:39,246 --> 00:17:42,910
back and then now we see it instances

245
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:46,804
like video views, ad name

246
00:17:48,624 --> 00:17:52,480
which are probably secured data set for me.

247
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:56,144
So we'll just see number of pair

248
00:17:56,184 --> 00:18:00,112
like cpms are less than this is an average

249
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,040
different different averages. So this gives

250
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:07,640
me clear understanding

251
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:13,338
of how my campaigns are going. Probably third

252
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:16,842
base and we

253
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:20,774
could able to predict lot of things using this data.

254
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:24,874
So let's

255
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:28,810
play around that. Also see

256
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:33,002
video is at 50% three videos

257
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:37,590
less than 50% at two Ctrl

258
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,174
expected azure traffic instances

259
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:46,654
CpC cpl yeah,

260
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:50,254
that's what it is. So considering the time,

261
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:55,338
we won't be deep diving into all of these links, but I would be sharing

262
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:58,794
these links with you personally where you can play around and tweet

263
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:02,482
things. Maybe figure out a better way to

264
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:04,234
do Dhanmi.

265
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:09,222
So let's wrap it up with

266
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:12,954
challenges in this whole LLM

267
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:16,678
navigation. One I see

268
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:20,114
is adaptation of

269
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,358
is hard. Getting a buy in where we say

270
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:28,334
someone is using one wants to get an open source.

271
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:32,206
One will conclude on

272
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,462
points where hey, is it safe? Is it,

273
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:38,742
are we leaking up any data? Are we getting a third party

274
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,114
data or what are we training it for?

275
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,766
Navigating the privacy regulations in the customer trust

276
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,598
is key, so we need to educate people about how

277
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:54,166
privacy could be maintained. It's a narrow game, but still the

278
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,654
best to figure it out. If you have any questions,

279
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:02,314
drop down your questions in the comments and you can also connect

280
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:05,098
with me or LinkedIn. That's all. Thank you,
