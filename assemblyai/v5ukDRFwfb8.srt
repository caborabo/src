00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,710
Hello, everyone. Welcome to this presentation on demystifying

2
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:34,356
the card payment lifecycle. Today we'll be exploring the

3
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,908
various components and processes involved in

4
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,516
card payments, as well as the role of machine learning in the

5
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,836
domain. First, let me introduce myself.

6
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,636
My name is Michael. I'm a software engineer. I began my professional

7
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,028
journey in 2014 and over the past

8
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:55,664
decade I've had the privilege to work with leading companies

9
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:59,324
in several sectors of the payments industry.

10
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:04,064
My experience actually in payments spans across a

11
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:05,764
wide range of sectors,

12
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:10,244
from working with a smart data,

13
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:14,160
smart card data personalization company where we

14
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:18,008
embed EMV data into payments

15
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:22,976
card chips, to payment

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,634
processing, fintech issuer

17
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:30,378
banks and so on. And for me, it's been

18
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:33,786
a very exciting journey. I hope for you

19
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,650
either you are looking to move into

20
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:41,194
the payment industry or you're already within the payment industry. It will also

21
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,858
be an exciting journey for you. All right,

22
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:48,194
so before we go into all of the

23
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,854
things about the payment lifecycle,

24
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:54,384
I thought to share some stats to even let you know.

25
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:59,900
Why is it even important to want to know what happens with

26
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:02,104
payments or with card payments? Basically,

27
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:06,860
first, as of 2022, and this

28
00:02:06,972 --> 00:02:10,692
number has increased drastically, but I couldn't get the more recent

29
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:15,184
stats. There were over 600 billion

30
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:19,692
transaction volumes per annum from

31
00:02:19,828 --> 00:02:23,668
card payments and this amounted into $4.2

32
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:26,264
trillion in spending annually.

33
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:30,260
That's a huge sum of money. However,

34
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:34,264
unfortunately, there's also a substantial $30 billion

35
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:38,020
loss to fraud every year from

36
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:42,744
card payments also. So let's

37
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:47,454
identify some of the main components and parties involved in

38
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,886
the card payment ecosystem. The first and

39
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,434
foremost is your, you know, the actual payment card itself.

40
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:58,950
That's the card that your bank or your financial institution

41
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:02,526
issues to you to be able to spend from your

42
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,474
account, right? And this could be a physical card

43
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:10,710
that you tap or swipe at a pure

44
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:15,612
point of sale terminal or a virtual card which

45
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:19,508
could be on your wallets, on your phone and so on.

46
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:23,104
And these cards generally or typically

47
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:27,420
contains a 16 to 18 digits number in front

48
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:31,224
of them, which is called the pan or the primary account number.

49
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:36,424
Next component is the cardholder, which is you. This is pretty much straightforward.

50
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:40,220
If you have a payment card, you are a cardholder.

51
00:03:40,252 --> 00:03:43,956
So basically you're the person who initiates transaction using the card

52
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,184
by swiping, tapping or entering your details online.

53
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:52,604
The next component is the issuer or the issuing

54
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:56,500
bank. Now this is the bank that the cardholder

55
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:59,820
has an account with, and that's the bank

56
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:02,824
that has issued the card to the cardholder.

57
00:04:04,484 --> 00:04:08,164
Next we have the card scheme or card network. Usually these are

58
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:11,496
companies like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, you know,

59
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,164
China Union pay, and so on. They facilitate transactions

60
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:18,844
between issuers and acquirers.

61
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:25,120
Usually this, the card you get issued by your

62
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:28,680
bank would have the logo

63
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:32,204
of who the card network is or the card scheme.

64
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:38,032
Next is a merchant. The merchant actually is a business itself

65
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:41,560
that is accepting card payment for goods and services. This could be

66
00:04:41,632 --> 00:04:45,324
Tesco, Sainsbury, Amazon, name it.

67
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:48,684
It could be a physical store merchant or an online merchant.

68
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:52,312
Next is the acquirer bank and the acquirer bank,

69
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:56,088
or the acquiring bank, or the acquirer is a financial

70
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:59,964
institution that actually processes card payment on behalf of the merchants.

71
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:04,744
Usually the acquiring bank is the bank where the merchants have their

72
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:08,238
own bank accounts, you know, so if you think about you as

73
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:12,294
a cardholder having your bank account with the issuer

74
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:15,886
who issues you a card, then the acquiring bank is

75
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,794
the bank where the merchants typically have their own account.

76
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:26,222
And typically the acquiring banks provide

77
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:29,750
the terminals that merchants, especially fish, scout store

78
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:33,238
merchants that need point of sale, like PoS terminals.

79
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:36,758
Usually the acquiring banks provide. Not always,

80
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:40,234
but usually provided by the acquiring bank. Those terminals,

81
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:45,350
last but not the least, is the payment gateway

82
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:49,582
or payment processor. These usually have technology providers that

83
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:53,174
help securely transmit transaction information between the merchants

84
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:57,702
and the acquiring bank. In most cases, these are more

85
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:00,554
likely to be used for online transactions,

86
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:05,498
and if the merchant has the technical capability

87
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:09,962
or expertise to be able to do this, payment gateways are not necessarily involved

88
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:15,418
in card payments. Transaction flow all

89
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:19,010
right, that was a lot. Please feel free to come back

90
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:22,770
to watch this part over again as

91
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:25,934
necessary if you missed anything in the first go.

92
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:30,644
So what do customers see when they make card payment?

93
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:34,396
Right from the customer's perspective, they interact with the card by

94
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,180
tapping their card on the terminal or entering their card

95
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:44,060
details on a website. And they

96
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:48,044
either get an optional, like verification

97
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:51,740
or authentication step in the old flow, which could

98
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:53,864
be asking for Pin or three deciseconds.

99
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:59,030
And after that, the next thing the customer says is whether the

100
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:02,790
transaction is approved or declined. So you either see that on the

101
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,534
POS terminal, or maybe you are redirected to a new page,

102
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:10,190
the success page on the web

103
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,942
portal for the merchant. And that's

104
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,126
it. You done? Payment done as

105
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,074
far as the customized concern, right?

106
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:24,534
Looks easy, right? Like my daughter would say, easy peasy.

107
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:29,978
Well, not quite easy

108
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:33,810
for the customer, which is good,

109
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:37,858
but not so easy for other parties involved because there

110
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:41,330
are a lot of other processes behind the scene that actually take

111
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:44,834
place, you know, and this includes authorization,

112
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:48,808
capture, settlement, reconciliation. We'll be talking about this

113
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,964
in detail. One after the other.

114
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:56,792
So starting with authorization, you know, this is actually the process that was described

115
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:01,416
in the previous slide where the cardholder initiates

116
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,564
the transaction when they want to pay for some goods and services.

117
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:08,416
You tap your card or, you know, enter your card

118
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,360
details, and then it initiates the authorization

119
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:15,960
request flow. So basically, what's the authorization request flow?

120
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:19,664
We can see from the diagram. The first step in the authorization request flow

121
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:23,520
is that the cardholder

122
00:08:23,632 --> 00:08:29,576
swipes their card, tap their card, enter the card details, whatever initiated

123
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,624
by the cardholder, the merchant receives this and

124
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:37,944
then sends this request to the

125
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,224
acquiring bank, either directly or again through a payment

126
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:45,033
processor. The merchant sends that request to the acquiring bank.

127
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:48,693
It's called the authorization request. Now, the acquiring bank

128
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:53,745
looks at this request

129
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:57,233
and based on the

130
00:08:57,273 --> 00:09:01,425
PAN, the first few digits in the PAN, it identifies

131
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:05,333
what issue, I'm sorry, what card network

132
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,833
the request should be routed to. And this could be either visa,

133
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:12,965
Mastercard or American Express. And once this

134
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:16,550
request is sent to the card network, the card

135
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:20,254
network itself, then based on the first six digits of the

136
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:23,038
PAN, determines,

137
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:27,414
actually six digits of the PAN is called the biN. That's a bank

138
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:30,798
identification number, or IIN, which is the issuer identification

139
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:33,454
number. So based on these first six digits,

140
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:37,814
the card network determines

141
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:41,410
what bank or what financial institution issued

142
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:45,122
that card and then they send a request to that financial institution. And this

143
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:48,682
could be bank of America, Citibank, or it could even be

144
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:52,194
one of the fintechs like wise revolutes and so on.

145
00:09:52,314 --> 00:09:55,586
Right. Then the Ishwa

146
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,962
bank performs a number of things which could be include balance

147
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:04,034
check, to be sure you have sufficient funds to pay

148
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:07,724
for what you're trying to do. Fraud check.

149
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:10,484
You know, to prevent fraud,

150
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:14,944
there's also transaction limits, checks, right?

151
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:18,364
Have you gone over your daily limit, your monthly limits, you know,

152
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:22,656
and any other transaction rules that apply once

153
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,604
all of this is done, if successful, the bank would,

154
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:30,770
the issuing bank would freeze that

155
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:34,186
fund from the cardholders

156
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,978
account and then send a successful response

157
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:41,098
all the way back. So sends the response back to the card network,

158
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:44,714
the card network sends it back to the acquiring

159
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:48,454
bank. We then send that response back to the merchant.

160
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:51,970
And then you see you as a cardholder,

161
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:55,578
you see the result on either the terminal or

162
00:10:55,746 --> 00:11:00,120
you get redirected on a website to the successful page that

163
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:03,720
the transaction is done. So again,

164
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:07,216
mouthful, this is everything that goes on.

165
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,224
Well, when I say everything, even still on a high level,

166
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:13,304
because there are a lot of other things that issuers

167
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:16,840
could do in the background and all of that. But, you know, this is like

168
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:21,144
an overview of the process and what happens when authorization

169
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,084
takes place.

170
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:27,812
Now, next would be capture,

171
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:31,284
right? Because when a transaction

172
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:35,420
takes place, the money is frozen from the

173
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:39,132
cardholders account. However, the merchant doesn't have the

174
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:42,700
money yet. The money is still technically with

175
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:45,664
the issuer, actually with the issuer.

176
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:51,068
But somehow the issuer knows that they owe some form of money to

177
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:54,516
somebody, right? So the next step that comes here

178
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,964
is at the end of the day, usually, not necessarily all merchants

179
00:11:58,004 --> 00:12:01,628
do this, but usually at the end of the day, sometimes it

180
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:05,604
might take two days, three days. Merchants then compile

181
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:08,900
a list of transactions that they've sent for

182
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:13,116
authorization on that day and send

183
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,624
it as a batch request to their acquiring bank,

184
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:20,872
right? The acquiring bank takes this batch

185
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:24,816
request and then splits it, categorizes it according to

186
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,256
Whatcard network. Because take for example,

187
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,684
an Amazon or say, Tesco.

188
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:35,144
Hundreds and thousands of people paying every day would

189
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:38,672
definitely have paid with different cards issued

190
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:41,736
by different banks and which have different card networks.

191
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,404
Could be Visa, Mastercard, American Express, right?

192
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,174
Usually Visa, Mastercard in the UK.

193
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:53,234
What the acquiring bank would do in this

194
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:56,818
case is further categorize or

195
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:00,530
split that request into two. In this case,

196
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:04,666
Mastercard and Visa request send one to Mastercard

197
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,054
and send the one for Visa to Visa, right?

198
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:11,926
Once that request is sent to

199
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,398
those card schemes, the card scheme themselves,

200
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:18,846
or the card network would then say, in this example,

201
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,110
I'll just go ahead with the Visa. Say Visa receives that request

202
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:26,494
from the acquiring bank. Visa then further

203
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:29,966
splits the request based

204
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,754
on. Because this could be, again,

205
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:37,474
say, hundred transactions

206
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:41,996
and 50 of them could have been from cards issued

207
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,660
by bank of America or 30 of them from banks,

208
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:49,268
from Citibank, you know, 20 from HSBC

209
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:52,636
or wise, you know, and so

210
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,468
on. So the scheme splits

211
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:59,892
this and then send the request to the capture request

212
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:03,196
to all of those financial

213
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,364
institutions. Now, what the financial institution would do

214
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:10,310
is they received a request and then they try to match each capture

215
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,774
record to a transaction that they've previously authorized.

216
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:17,126
Right? To show that, okay, we've authorized this transaction before to

217
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,046
freeze this money. Now we are confirming that this transaction is

218
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,270
completed because the merchant is now asking that they would be

219
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:29,094
collecting this money, right? So that

220
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:33,566
happens. Now, for some banks, the user experience is

221
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,794
usually different. For some banks or for some financial institutions,

222
00:14:37,414 --> 00:14:40,534
when you initiate a transaction, you see

223
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:44,326
the transaction with the status of pending. And when capture actually

224
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,314
happens, the status changes to completed.

225
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:49,554
While for some other banks,

226
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:55,270
when you, they show this to you in a way of showing

227
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:59,302
you two different balances, you could have an

228
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:03,184
available balance and a book balance or booking balance. Available balance

229
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:06,664
is the amount you have to spend, which usually is less than the

230
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:10,496
booking balance, because available balance would be booking balance

231
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,924
minus any pending money that needs to go out.

232
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:19,256
So, yeah, so that's

233
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,008
how capture is then done. And still

234
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:26,644
there's no money movement in capture. That just confirms that the merchant has

235
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:31,360
stated their intent to, you know, capture this money.

236
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:34,524
To collect this money, there comes settlement,

237
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:39,524
which is the step four of the diagram. Right. The issue bank

238
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:44,528
will then initiate after receiving settlement requests,

239
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:50,416
usually, sometimes through the card scheme, initiates the actual

240
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,080
money movement by paying this fund, maybe to the card

241
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:57,086
scheme or directly to the acquirer bank,

242
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,534
and then the acquire bank would then settle their merchants.

243
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:06,374
And yet again, this process,

244
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:11,642
even though it's technically the end of the

245
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:15,226
card payment life cycle, there's still reconciliation

246
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,866
that has to be, or that needs to be done by some

247
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,010
of these parties, especially the issuer bank. You need

248
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:26,240
to confirm that

249
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:30,064
the money that was paid in and the money that is paid

250
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:33,672
out actually matches. Right.

251
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:37,984
So what do I mean by that? There are several types

252
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:41,496
of transactions that could happen in a day. You know, you could have authorization requests,

253
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,164
could have reversals. You have chat box, you have fees.

254
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:49,850
It's even more complicated or more complex if you have multi

255
00:16:49,882 --> 00:16:53,602
currency transactions. Right. You would need

256
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:57,034
to. A transaction could be done in one currency,

257
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:59,054
and the settlement is done in a different currency.

258
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:04,734
Companies have to implement very sophisticated

259
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:10,378
functionalities or very sophisticated systems to

260
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:13,498
actually do reconciliation.

261
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:17,038
Reconciliation, as far as I'm concerned, is, like,

262
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:20,502
the most difficult, the most daunting part of this whole process. Not to

263
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:24,434
say orders are simple. Mostly, they require speed.

264
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:28,614
When I type my card, I need to get a response as soon as possible

265
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:31,094
as to whether it's successful or not. I don't want to wait too long.

266
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:33,794
Every other thing is, it happens in the back end.

267
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:37,686
And for some of these, they are very computationally heavy.

268
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,014
So that's why I consider it one of the most,

269
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:45,710
you know, daunting parts or the one of the most complicated parts

270
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:49,286
of this. And just

271
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,354
before I move on, you know,

272
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,394
one reason why this is very.

273
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:01,634
You know, why it's a very daunting task is that

274
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:05,662
in addition to all of the types of transactions I've mentioned here.

275
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:09,234
Right. You could have something. We have something called

276
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:12,466
preord. I didn't want to go too

277
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,134
much into this, but we have something called preord. Right.

278
00:18:16,154 --> 00:18:19,346
And basically, imagine when you go to a gas station to buy

279
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,334
fuel. This doesn't happen in every country anymore.

280
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:27,338
In some countries, you tap your card before you buy the fuel.

281
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:33,844
So gas station actually like,

282
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:37,768
sends authorization requests to reserve a certain amount. This could be say 100

283
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,248
pounds, and then you end up buying fuel.

284
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:45,344
And you might just buy foil for 60 pound and then there's a 40 pound

285
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:49,592
difference. When they send the captcha to the

286
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:53,512
issuer, they are going to be capturing the actual amount of the

287
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:56,524
foil you bought, which is 60 pounds.

288
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:01,680
And again, this is going to reflect the, the issuer

289
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:04,680
would have authorization request, which is 100 pounds. And then when they get the capture

290
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:08,272
request, it's 60 pounds. They need to be able to identify that this

291
00:19:08,288 --> 00:19:12,048
is the same transaction. Also, when you go to hotels,

292
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:15,272
for example, you make payments, or sometimes they reserve some money just in case of

293
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:21,256
damages and of that, which brings me to the

294
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,624
point of where after authorization is done,

295
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:28,372
every merchant actually has a limited

296
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:31,844
amount of time to send

297
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:35,820
capture request. Otherwise that transaction would

298
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:39,660
be reversed or cancelled and the money will be refunded to

299
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:43,516
the customer. So even though you provided the

300
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,984
service and the person has gotten either the goods or the service,

301
00:19:47,284 --> 00:19:50,996
if you don't capture within, I think there's

302
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,660
for pre authorization and authorization, you don't capture within seven to

303
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:58,996
15 days, then the transaction is reversed and

304
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,424
that's it. You have no legal rights to,

305
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:05,636
or the customer has legal rights if you try to capture their money to tell

306
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,364
you that it's now their money. So, yeah,

307
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:11,624
maybe something not to note,

308
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:16,864
but yeah, so that's on what actually

309
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:20,184
really does happen.

310
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:26,404
So where does ML come in in all of this?

311
00:20:28,904 --> 00:20:32,232
First is fraud detection and

312
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:35,924
prevention. Right. We already said earlier that there's

313
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:39,928
over $30 billion per year in

314
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:41,324
fraud loss.

315
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:47,564
Usually all of the parties involved,

316
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,522
the issuer bank, the card scheme, or the

317
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:55,234
card network, the acquire bank, usually have

318
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:59,174
some form of fraud detection or fraud prevention

319
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:02,334
systems or mechanisms, right.

320
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:07,674
And usually these systems are

321
00:21:07,754 --> 00:21:11,538
more efficient if you have some form of machine learning models

322
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:15,514
that are learning new tactics that

323
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:19,566
like basically getting new ways to identify what could be a

324
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,354
fraudulent, or detect what could be a fraudulent transaction.

325
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:25,990
Next is, yeah, again, it's very similar to the previous,

326
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:30,062
but in this case, identifying transaction data discrepancies.

327
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:33,782
Right. This is not necessarily used for fraud,

328
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:37,310
which is why I've separated them. Right. You might be using this to maybe in

329
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:40,800
your settlement flow or, or something just

330
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,616
to, you know, either rather than waiting for human

331
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,000
to find out that something has gone wrong somewhere. Because a lot of things go

332
00:21:48,032 --> 00:21:51,432
wrong when it comes to payment authorization,

333
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,284
capture, and, you know, settlement reconciliation.

334
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:58,344
You could use machine learning to at least help you

335
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:01,736
automate and suggest, you know, it helps you

336
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,936
debug in sort of a way and shows you, hey, I think this could be

337
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,880
wrong. And then you can then go and find out

338
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:12,120
if it's truly wrong or not. Next is

339
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:16,096
predictive analysis, right. If you

340
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,296
are an issuer, that you're

341
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,984
global, if you're a global issuer, meaning your

342
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:28,176
cards, which is actually the case for most issuers

343
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,400
or for most banks, if you really want to try right now, in this

344
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:35,374
day and age, your cards will be used internationally, right.

345
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:39,014
This means that there would be multi,

346
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:43,434
multiple currencies you might need to

347
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:46,774
settle in, pounds, in USD,

348
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:49,654
name it, swedish krona, and so on.

349
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:54,194
And this could translate into you having multiple

350
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:57,458
bank accounts where this

351
00:22:57,506 --> 00:23:00,846
liquidity would be just to have pounds to be able to settle

352
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,914
and all of that. Now, this is one of the most.

353
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:08,958
One other part that is very challenging for, I would

354
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:12,166
say, especially the treasury team of these companies,

355
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,390
where you need to know whether you should

356
00:23:15,422 --> 00:23:18,206
owe more pounds or more USD.

357
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,406
And this could depend on what are the interest rates on these currencies

358
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,694
or what's the fluctuation, like,

359
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:28,674
how the volatility of the currency and all of that.

360
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:33,048
Machine learning could be used to help at least try

361
00:23:33,096 --> 00:23:35,004
to narrow down how much,

362
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:40,664
approximately you need to hold in that

363
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:42,404
currency for settlement.

364
00:23:43,904 --> 00:23:47,604
And last but not least is customer experience.

365
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:51,776
For customer experience, machine learning could be used to personalize the

366
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,566
authentication experience. You could understand what

367
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,514
kind of authentication method the customers prefer to use the most.

368
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:03,494
You could use this to customize rewards and promotion based

369
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:07,886
on the kind of transactions

370
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,518
that the cardholders are executing

371
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:15,942
and or initiating. And lastly, you could use,

372
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:19,598
this is used in some form of credit scoring

373
00:24:19,646 --> 00:24:20,874
and risk management.

374
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:26,446
So, yeah, those are some

375
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,046
of the main use cases of machine learning.

376
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,550
Of course, machine learning is used in a lot

377
00:24:34,622 --> 00:24:37,790
more places in payments, but the list will go

378
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:41,742
on and on. But there

379
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:45,070
are still several challenges, because I'm not

380
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:49,154
sure if there's been some bells ringing when I was mentioning the last

381
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:52,844
set of use cases for machine learning,

382
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:56,172
which involves things around customer data.

383
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:59,556
Right. One of the challenges is data privacy and

384
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,564
security. Now, this goes in several ways.

385
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:06,252
It could be, I like

386
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:10,420
to say something that where there's money, there's tendency for fraud.

387
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:14,424
So in terms of security, you need to ensure that

388
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:18,512
customer data is secured. And of course, you also need to

389
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:22,160
respect the privacy of, you know, those customers. Right.

390
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:26,520
Customer data has to be secured. Even if you have any system,

391
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:30,136
either machine learning or AI or whatever, any other system that you use in

392
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,336
dealing with customer data, it has to be secured so

393
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,444
that you don't expose sensitive cardholder information. And also,

394
00:25:37,864 --> 00:25:41,696
in most cases, which we'll still talk about a bit later on,

395
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,664
it has to also adhere to regulations

396
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:49,044
such as GDPR, PCI and all of that.

397
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:56,336
We've seen that machine learning models can introduce bias,

398
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,044
leading to unfair treatment of certain groups.

399
00:26:00,544 --> 00:26:04,324
It's really essential to monitor and mitigate this bias

400
00:26:05,504 --> 00:26:09,056
to ensure fairness. And lastly,

401
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,722
which I already entered on in the first is regulatory

402
00:26:13,778 --> 00:26:17,890
compliance. I mean, it's not surprisingly, the payments industry

403
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:21,314
is highly regulated, with different regions

404
00:26:21,394 --> 00:26:25,434
actually having varying or different compliance requirements.

405
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:29,722
Right. And organizations need to navigate these regulations carefully

406
00:26:29,858 --> 00:26:33,094
to avoid penalties or reputational damages.

407
00:26:34,514 --> 00:26:38,434
So what other way to try to end

408
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,254
this presentation than to, you know,

409
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:44,834
make some, I don't know, keep the

410
00:26:44,914 --> 00:26:48,234
room light, right. You get AI,

411
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:51,802
you get AI. Everybody gets AI. We've seen that AI

412
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:57,014
is becoming more and more injected

413
00:26:57,554 --> 00:27:01,698
into a lot of industries

414
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,978
and the payment industry is not exempted from that.

415
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:08,226
A lot of products, a lot of features,

416
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:12,898
a lot of these things that are manually done would have

417
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:16,522
very good use cases for AI to come in in the

418
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:20,214
nearest future. So keep an eye out on that. And yeah,

419
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:24,706
thank you for listening. I hope that you

420
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,986
actually gained a clearer understanding of card payment lifecycle,

421
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:33,322
the role of machine learning in terms of improving efficiency,

422
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:37,498
security and improving

423
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:41,474
customer experience, and also the future trend in terms of

424
00:27:41,634 --> 00:27:44,994
where we think AI might be used.
