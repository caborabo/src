00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:30,978
Hello everyone, my name is Adhikar. I'm a senior product manager at

2
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:34,266
Worldpay. Today I'll be talking about aification

3
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,818
of financial services. It's a very interesting

4
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:41,778
topic and there's lots of information to absorb.

5
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:45,826
I'll try to keep it short, simple and hopefully sweet.

6
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,546
So let's begin. So before we understand the

7
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,694
AI repercussions in financial services, here's a quick

8
00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:57,950
recap of what does AI mean? What is an AI 101?

9
00:00:58,062 --> 00:01:02,086
So the various types of AI which exists, the first is predictive ML.

10
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,394
So this is basically the AI which exists today and

11
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:10,358
potentially what all financial services are using of

12
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:13,902
today. So this is all machine learning

13
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:17,382
based, rules based, doing simple text

14
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,308
analysis, data extraction, predictions on the basis

15
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:25,316
of you feeding the AI, the artificial

16
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,396
intelligence, some rules. Now, the new hype, or the

17
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,732
current hype is about Gen AI or generative AI.

18
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:36,148
Now this is where OpenAI and the GPT era has,

19
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:40,132
has come into picture. Now this is more capable than predictive

20
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:44,100
ML because it is multimodal, which is AI

21
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:47,764
speak for saying that it can process information of various types,

22
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:52,028
be it text, videos or images. It can do data summarization,

23
00:01:52,116 --> 00:01:55,692
it can be used for code generation. And most importantly,

24
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:59,784
or what we are seeing right now is it can do contextual conversations.

25
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:04,292
Building on this, the future is going to be general

26
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:08,604
intelligence or auto generative AI. So this

27
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:12,780
is basically gen AI, but with deeper context, a persistent

28
00:02:12,852 --> 00:02:16,314
memory, so it remembers what the previous conversations were,

29
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:19,718
and a system, two kind of reasoning. So it can not just to

30
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:23,502
summarize information or give you insight, but it can actually

31
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:26,550
try to be more human like in nature,

32
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:30,294
more proactive. Now, this is where the future is going

33
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:34,686
to go towards why is AI coming into

34
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,206
so much popularity right now? So it's a case of,

35
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,502
it's a case of multiple reasons. So firstly,

36
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:46,136
competent elements. So you're seeing players like hugging phase Openeye

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,464
or Google's Gemini come into the market with really strong

38
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:54,088
processing and really capable large language

39
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:58,232
models. There's also traction. Now, chat JPT has

40
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:01,976
been one of the fastest companies to reach

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,728
10 million users. There's a lot of enthusiasm

42
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:09,064
about chat GPT and also other AI models like mid journey,

43
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:11,724
which is used for creating art.

44
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:16,080
Along with all of these positive, there's also a lot of hype. So for

45
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,808
example, I'm just trying to give some examples of what

46
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:23,800
I consider hype. Oral B coming up with an AI kind of a brush,

47
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:27,456
Microsoft adding AI into its PC. So there's

48
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,672
a lot of hype about, about AI right now in the tech world.

49
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:34,120
And for that reason, even financial services are curious

50
00:03:34,152 --> 00:03:37,656
to understand what could be the repercussions or benefits for

51
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,060
them. The potential is huge. It has

52
00:03:41,172 --> 00:03:44,780
use cases panning over over industries.

53
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:48,484
So that's why AI is becoming so crucial right now.

54
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:52,588
In terms of who benefits, there would be three key archetypes

55
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:55,708
for companies who can truly unlock the power of AI.

56
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:59,212
Companies which are data rich, so they have the network effects going

57
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:02,924
on. They have a large amounts of data which they can use to

58
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:06,656
come up with recommendations or insights.

59
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,560
They are very compliance driven, they are focusing on

60
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:14,248
monitoring and governance. And third, the company

61
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:18,248
or the organization is product led. Now, all of this is

62
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:22,224
not possible if you're not really able to quickly test out

63
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:25,792
your ideas and see if it works or not. So in terms

64
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,964
of the gen AI or the generative AI in finance today,

65
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:34,354
in my opinion, I'm largely seeing these use

66
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:38,314
cases emerge in personal finance. So companies like Monarch

67
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:41,450
and Clio are trying to use this for spend management,

68
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:45,330
budgeting and just acting as your AI buddy

69
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:48,770
when it comes to spend management, we are seeing

70
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:52,386
a lot of uptake in customer support. Almost every big

71
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,898
bank or fintech has an AI enabled bot.

72
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:59,732
Interestingly, Klarna recently claimed that their AI

73
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:03,352
is able to do a work of 700 agents. So we

74
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:07,088
are seeing already that the conversational side of the AI

75
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:10,808
is being heavily leveraged by the financial services.

76
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,096
Now going in the future, I see that these

77
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,808
use cases will go deeper into three key areas, which is

78
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:21,364
risk and compliance, developer tools and internal process.

79
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:26,004
So now let's try to unpack this a bit. So risk and compliance

80
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:29,944
in terms of making real time decisions, in terms of understanding

81
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:33,592
the risk, the credit of the unbanked or

82
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:37,404
the underbanked population, be it to b two c or b two b.

83
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,528
I see AI playing a huge part in this. We are already seeing this

84
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:45,184
happening on the b two z side with bnpls leveraging AI

85
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:48,896
for real time credit decisioning. But I see this

86
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,696
making a huge impact on the b two B side or the trade financing side,

87
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,472
which has been largely unexplored in terms of

88
00:05:56,528 --> 00:06:01,244
internal processes. We are seeing companies such as Stripe or highradius

89
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:05,064
use this to make sure that the internal data is optimized.

90
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:09,000
So for example, you want to run a query or

91
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:12,704
understand data for your company, you can just ask AI

92
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:16,448
that. Hey AI, I want to find me the transactions

93
00:06:16,496 --> 00:06:19,992
for the past 30 days. I want to figure out what has went wrong

94
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:23,520
and these conversational kind of things could be converted into

95
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:27,478
actual insights. This is going to really be a game changer for

96
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:31,638
larger financial organizations where finding data and

97
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,422
creating insights is often a challenge in

98
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:38,918
terms of dev tools. Again, I think stripe is one of those early AI

99
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:42,182
leaders who are trying to integrate AI into

100
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:45,430
developer experience. Potentially you will

101
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:50,790
see in the future this becoming omnipresent. You will be seeing developers

102
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:54,710
just conversationally asking that I want to create a payment service

103
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:57,756
using stripe as a payment service method,

104
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,316
using Worldpay as an acquirer or any other XYZ

105
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,796
service. And the AI is going to ensure that

106
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,700
every connection comes into place. With all of

107
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:12,828
this AI bruhaha, there's a word of caution which I feel

108
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:16,788
we should be taking in context.

109
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:20,484
So with AI, there are certain challenges. The AI

110
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,268
hallucinations are real, are a problem. So this is

111
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:27,576
basically making some

112
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,088
nonsensical assumptions or creating data

113
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:34,456
out of thin air. We have already seen examples of how

114
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,604
AI can just sometimes go off topic.

115
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:42,056
So second is the data integrity or the data quality.

116
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,760
So it's basically garbage in and garbage out. As my stats

117
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:49,480
professor used to say. If the data is not cleaned

118
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:53,416
enough, has not been removed of any particular biases,

119
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,096
the AI is going to be trained accordingly. So companies need to be

120
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,984
careful of what data sets the AI is getting, is getting

121
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:05,576
trained on. Third is governance controls in terms of monitoring

122
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,952
what AI can and cannot do, how, which of these are mission

123
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:14,064
critical, which of these are regulatory driven and ensuring that

124
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:17,460
AI has proper compliance and governance controls?

125
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:21,108
And fourth is overengineering. Simply putting

126
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:25,172
AI into your product is not going to solve a problem. As I

127
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:28,636
gave these some examples earlier, AI is

128
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,052
a means to a problem and not the opposite way.

129
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:35,732
So it should be carefully helping you solve your problem

130
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:39,220
rather than a solution looking for a problem.

131
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:42,876
So given all of this context, how should fis or the financial

132
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,450
services respond? So as I pointed out on the

133
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:50,322
last slide, first and foremost, find the right problems to

134
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:53,586
be solved using AI. Look for critical,

135
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,594
manually intensive tasks that AI can truly help

136
00:08:57,634 --> 00:09:01,146
you solve and can make it more optimum

137
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,122
for you. Second is assess options. Look what's out there from

138
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:08,538
an AI perspective, do you need to build by or

139
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:12,608
partner to current options, meet your needs,

140
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:16,152
understand their abilities and limitations before trying to integrate

141
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,752
them into your day to day reorganize.

142
00:09:19,848 --> 00:09:23,280
I think it's very important for organizations right now to

143
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:27,128
understand that AI is a critical element of

144
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:30,768
your organization and build a culture and the right

145
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:34,264
talent pool which can help your organization adopt to

146
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:38,444
AI. And fourth and foremost, the most important bit is experiment,

147
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:43,264
build, test and iterate. Look at what works for you, what doesn't

148
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:47,412
understand the proof of concepts for various

149
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:51,004
use cases to really understand whether AI is fit for

150
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:54,764
purpose for you. I thank you for taking this time
