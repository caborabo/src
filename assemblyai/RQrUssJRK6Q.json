Terraform is one of the best products that I've used for infrastructure as a code which helped me build a lot of infrastructure in AWS, Google, Chronicle, tribble as well as splunk cloud. Like to talk more of my expertise and my experience in using Terraform and chef and also how did it help the cloud security automation and I would like to share like we have a lineup of topics that I would like to discuss starting with introduction and what is Terraform and chef benefits of automating cloud security with Terraform, integration of strategies for terraform and chef security best practices with Terraform and a real world case study. The future trends, challenges and key takeaways introduction so cloud computing automation is on the rise, but security remains a critical concern. Manual security configurations are prone to human error and inconsistencies, so automation of security infrastructure deployment is essential for consistent and efficient security practices. The presentation explores more on integrating terraform and chef for automating cloud security infrastructure. Terraform is one of very good product, I can say a beautiful product for open source infrastructure as a code. Been using this for almost eight years. And the best part of Terraform is, you know, you can scale up, expand, destroy, deploy configurations, everything in a matter of less than two minutes, let it be in Toronto or let it be in AWS or data lake or splunk cloud chef on the other hand is is a master tool for automation and deployment. Like conflict management platform for automated infrastructure configuration and deployment. Both tools enable automation, vision control and collaboration for infrastructure management. So benefits of automating cloud security. So first is consistency security configurations across all the cloud environments you may have a huge infrastructure globally, say like Asia Pacific, Europe or you know in America. So having automation tool handle these environments is first enables consistency and the sanity of all the configurations is up in the repo and also reduce the risk of human error and misconfigurations. Improved compliance and other ends to security best practices, faster deployment and scaling of security infrastructure and increased efficiency and productivity for IT teams, especially for cloud security. We have the Cert teams, we have the sort teams, we have the security compliance, we have the global compliance teams. So everyone using having like an access to a global environment is as crucial as having the cloud security automation in the best practice. So integration strategies for terraform and chef. So terraform is mainly used for provisioning cloud resources. Example like virtual machines, VPN, VPC, transit gateways, networks and storage and EBS volumes. We can define the entire architecture of an infrastructure of a server in terraform saying that hey, I want like for example if you take an AWS instance, you can say that I would like to have, maybe I would like to have a EC two instance with so and so volume with maybe two, two gates, three gates and however you want to have the EBS storage volume also terraform provision set. Chef on the other hand is for configuring and managing the provision resources. Like for example installing security software, configuring firewalls, push in confets, maybe LDAP roles and also a lot of infrastructure for you know ad groups as well. Leveraging terraform provider ecosystem and chefs could put repositories and also automating the entire splunt, the security infrastructure lifestyle that we have. Security best practices with terraform and chef. So implementing infrastructure as a core principles for security configurations, enabling version control for audit trails and security automating, security hardening and patches for processes and also integrating security scanning and compliance chains in the automation pipeline. So say that we have a large enterprise with a hybrid cloud environment challenge, ensuring consistent security configuration across multiple providers. So in this example, let's say that we have a hybrid cloud environment in US, in Europe, in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. So having in a hybrid infrastructure, what you have is for anything for the servers that are on Prem chef is enabled. So any configuration that you want to push to the server based in New Zealand or Europe, chef, you know, we do it with automation using chef and anyone, anything in cloud say AWS or chronicle or splunk cloud tribal etcetera. We use terraform challenge ensuring consistency security configuration across multiple cloud terraform for provisional resources where we can provide say that hey in main TF or in networking TF TF files are the terraform files where we describe network security groups or resources and chef for configuring security controls. The final results of this is improved security posture, reduced manual effort and faster time to market new services. Say if I want to have a service up in New Zealand and if I have the account ready by the networking team maybe it's a days work of in building the infrastructure, setting up the VPC network, the transit gateways and also scaling and you can destroy the instances using terraform all within an hour. So that's the best way of, you know, giving an example on how terraform can we can use terraform to steal an environment challenges in consideration, not, not like, not on a very mine critical scale. It's just like you know, managing and maintaining infrastructure as code repositories make sure that all the code is checked in reviewed, peer reviewed, approved and merged and always work off on YouTube. New pull or a new repo and integrating with existing security tools and processes like if you have any security tools that are on Prem, find a way like you know how we can integrate using Terraform or chef and how the apps can be deployed using these and addressing compliance and regulatory requirements. So if having the Terraform repo made sure that you know it is only accessible to the team that are the owners of it, but not like across the or across the company for compliance purposes. Increased adoption of infrastructure as a code and configuration managed tools light of future trends and developments integration with cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection platform shift towards policy as a code and compliance as code approaches advancements in automated security and testing. The key takeaways is automating security infrastructure deployment is crucial for consistent and efficient security practices. Terraform and chef provide powerful tools for automating cloud security infrastructure integration. Security strategies and security best practices enable organization to enhance their cloud security posture. Real world case studies demonstrate the benefit of implementing terraform and chef and integrating terraform and chef for cloud security. Automation is a powerful approach to ensure consistent, efficient and cloud security infrastructure. This is my conclusion on it and definitely I would recommend people using chef and terraform. By leveraging infrastructure as a code and configuration management principles, organizations can reduce definitely human errors and improve compliance and enhance their overall security posture. By embracing tools like Terraform and chef, organizations can stay ahead of evolving security challenges and maintain a robust and resilient cloud environment.
