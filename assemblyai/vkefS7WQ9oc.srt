1
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,114
Hello everybody, today we'll talk about safety

2
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:32,162
and I will present you the concept of safety crowdsourcing.

3
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:35,798
I am Bruce Lanzaribev, I am the CEO of greed company.

4
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:39,254
And we'll show you the solution, and we'll show

5
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:43,314
you the business benefits of risk

6
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:47,106
hunting. When we talk about heavy

7
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:50,906
industry, we always mean that it's connected

8
00:00:50,938 --> 00:00:54,618
with heavy risks. For example, these are two pictures

9
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:58,842
of metallurgy plant of NLF

10
00:00:58,906 --> 00:01:02,554
refinery. And these enterprises are

11
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:07,634
huge, so the size can be 10.

12
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:12,126
Course at these size of enterprises,

13
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,650
the incidents are inevitable.

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,766
So if we look at some statistics for the United States

15
00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:23,640
in 2022 there were

16
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,130
five and a half thousand of fatal work injures

17
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,250
by different types. And the number of injuries is increasing.

18
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,662
So why it's still increasing?

19
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:40,642
And what's the problem with the conventional risk management?

20
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:44,778
First of all, it's static procedures and policies.

21
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:48,542
So we build the list

22
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:52,030
of procedures and we always try

23
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,742
to comply with them without developing

24
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:59,694
the new culture. And this traditional safety

25
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:03,774
is based on periodic inspection. So the health and security officer

26
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:08,214
is performing his

27
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:12,194
daily routines and checking the checklist.

28
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:16,114
So it's very time consuming and we may not cultures

29
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:20,218
the unforeseen risks. And what

30
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:25,962
also I have to mention is that the

31
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:30,070
conventional risk management is based on past

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,126
statistics. We analyze incidents and improve the

33
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:38,474
policy, rather than identifying and moving proactive.

34
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:42,800
So it's a proactive approach to the safety, and of course

35
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,774
the limited employee engagement. The employees

36
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:51,442
are usually outside of the safety process, they have to

37
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:55,730
follow, they have to stick to the rules,

38
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,302
but they are not part

39
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:03,462
of this strategy. So what

40
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:07,346
we would like to achieve with risk

41
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:10,806
Hunter is the safety crowdsourcing.

42
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:14,826
What do we call the safety crowdsourcing? This is the process

43
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:18,582
when every employee is becoming

44
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:22,990
the proactive person and

45
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,960
he's involved into the safety, involved into

46
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,750
identifying new potential risks.

47
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,378
So our concept is based

48
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:39,710
on the bottom up motivation,

49
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,426
how we call it. So conventional risk management is the

50
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:47,586
top down motivation, and our concept is based on

51
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:51,414
the bottom up motivation. So we want everyone

52
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:55,206
to become part of the new safety culture and we want

53
00:03:55,228 --> 00:03:58,780
to engage and focus people on

54
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,170
finding safety issues in the enterprises.

55
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,822
So the focus safety is first and productivity

56
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:10,140
is second. So safety is always

57
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,150
more important than current duties.

58
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,646
And this is the concept. So in practice we

59
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:23,854
have a technology platform that supports

60
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:27,986
this concept. It's called risk Hunter. And what's the

61
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:31,074
idea that everyone has the mobile application,

62
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:35,002
and if you spot the risk, you take a photo

63
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,486
and you comment, you assign it

64
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:42,146
to the category and send it to the risk manager. The risk

65
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:45,846
manager validates this risk. And if

66
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:48,860
he confirms that this is the real one,

67
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,734
then the employee who reported is receiving

68
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:55,980
the reward for that, the bonus points.

69
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,374
Well, we have been speaking a lot on

70
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:05,214
motivation in the system and we have

71
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:09,630
currently two motivation models. First is material motivation.

72
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,986
So when you reach certain number of points,

73
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:18,450
then you can exchange them for some tangible practices,

74
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,370
discount vouchers, certificates,

75
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,790
subscription to the online cinema and so on.

76
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,566
This is the material motivation. But what works better

77
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:34,470
is the non material or personal motivation.

78
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,762
Well, recent researches show that intangible

79
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:44,330
motivation works

80
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,138
better in long term. So that's why currently we focus

81
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:52,222
on the personal motivation more than on material one.

82
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:56,462
And we have the list of

83
00:05:56,516 --> 00:06:00,110
personal pages, so you can reach certain

84
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,542
level within the department

85
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:08,434
after you get certain number of points and you

86
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:12,402
receive awards. So we want this

87
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:16,006
motivation to be the foundation of

88
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:20,642
our solution. So if you report, for example, 17 tasks,

89
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:25,154
then you can get the level one hunter

90
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:28,682
and so on. What is important

91
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:32,134
is the hunting season. So in our solution

92
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:36,230
we have the hunting season so that we can focus attention

93
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,674
on certain types of

94
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:43,518
risks. For example, in winter it could be

95
00:06:43,684 --> 00:06:47,102
one categories, in summertime or

96
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:51,386
after rain it can be another one. So the hunting season allows

97
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:54,786
us to focus attention on certain

98
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:58,370
problems, lives, electricity risks, for example,

99
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,594
next two weeks we look for the electricity issues and then

100
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:06,278
we can focus and concentrate all the people

101
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:09,800
on problems within the company.

102
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,630
Well, hunting season is also connected with the gamification.

103
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,430
We have the competitions in the system, so different

104
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,458
plants can compete with each other and even

105
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:29,910
different teams within one plant can compete between

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
each other. So that

107
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,486
really drives the involvement and

108
00:07:37,668 --> 00:07:44,222
more interest into the system. So we had some situations

109
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:49,102
when the people were really keen

110
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,558
to have the first place in the competition.

111
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:56,950
So that's the competition

112
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,960
spirit. And what's also important, that we can not only

113
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,902
give rewards for taking the first place,

114
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:10,758
but we can also can give rewards for passing

115
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:14,726
safety training. Well, for passing safety exams.

116
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:17,974
So it's not only about finding their risks,

117
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:21,230
but it's also about being prepared.

118
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,614
So it's the spirit of collaboration and loyalty of

119
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:26,240
stuff.

120
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,480
Well, of course,

121
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:39,454
in the risk hunter it's very important to attend

122
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:42,530
the training to properly identify the risks.

123
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,600
And for this we also grant the

124
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,914
bonus points for passing surveys,

125
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:54,950
for taking all the trainings.

126
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,218
And we integrate the risk hunter with corporate learning

127
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:04,374
system so that we can also integrate

128
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:07,740
the risk hunter into the learning process.

129
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,482
In the morning, when the person is fresh

130
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:17,162
and ready to work, we have the safety quests

131
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:21,306
so that you don't

132
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:27,598
forget the safety lessons

133
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:31,262
and that's every morning. We can have some random

134
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:33,460
tests, tip of the days,

135
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,554
and it's pushed by the notification

136
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:41,078
so that you don't forget to pass it. Depending on

137
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:44,600
the location, in the large plans, there can be different

138
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,542
risky places, risky locations. So we have a location

139
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:53,494
based safety brief. When you enter, for example, the warehouse

140
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:57,274
area, then you will get a video on

141
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,990
risks related to warehouse management.

142
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,574
And that's good for large

143
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:08,494
enterprises. But what's important

144
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:12,302
is that every reported risk has

145
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:14,926
to be mitigated.

146
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:18,286
And after it had been eliminated,

147
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:21,874
the person who reported it should get a

148
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:26,674
notification about the elimination

149
00:10:26,722 --> 00:10:29,810
of the risk. Because if there is no feedback,

150
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,638
then the employees, they quickly lose the interest

151
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:37,590
in this application. So the feedback is the core

152
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,542
part of our application. And the risk manager

153
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:45,146
also has the mobile applications, so he can be

154
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:48,506
in the field and he can assign the task to

155
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:52,510
other people, to other workers, to fix something

156
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,438
or to prevent this

157
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,200
from happening in the future.

158
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,620
What's also important is the

159
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,340
statistics, so we can always see

160
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,782
the percentage of risks eliminated.

161
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:15,838
We can see which risks are trending,

162
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:19,800
for example, fall flung, hates or get

163
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,670
contact with dangerous substances.

164
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,314
So we always can stay on track and see how

165
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:32,410
we progress in making the environment safer.

166
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,986
It can be also aggregated by year.

167
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:40,686
So we have statistics on

168
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:44,430
the type of the risk, sleeps or trips,

169
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,366
exposure to harmful substances. And we

170
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:51,886
can always be informed on the

171
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:55,614
progress and on the. Of course, the high priority risks

172
00:11:55,662 --> 00:12:00,114
should be eliminated first, so we can have the focus on

173
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,050
these kinds of risks.

174
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,842
And there are some examples,

175
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:09,640
real life examples. For example, that's the open engine,

176
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,250
and after it has been reported,

177
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,600
so we have the protective cover with a

178
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,954
sign on that, so that no one puts his hand into this.

179
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:24,794
And that's the steam coming out

180
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:27,542
of the pipe. So it had been fixed,

181
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:31,360
and now this is the picture after the

182
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,982
work had been done. Well,

183
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:39,902
what's the advantages of our solution? It's that

184
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:42,746
we involve all in place into the process.

185
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:46,798
We use the gamification and we ensure

186
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:51,090
the feedback, so every risk is spotted and eliminated.

187
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,454
And we have the history

188
00:12:56,572 --> 00:13:00,022
of using this solution for three

189
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:04,022
years now. And for that time we have

190
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:07,534
registered more than 150,000 risks.

191
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:11,114
And out of them almost 600 are

192
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:15,558
extremely dangerous situations

193
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:18,842
which could cause the fatal injury or

194
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:22,366
death. So we also have the

195
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:26,298
statistics that the risk hunter reduces number of injures

196
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:29,854
by 25%. And outs of

197
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:34,222
this number of fatalities also go

198
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:38,640
down. So for the three years we have almost 50%

199
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,710
decrease in fatalities.

200
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,054
And so that's the last

201
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:51,750
slide of my presentation. So we are working

202
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,150
hard to improve the safety. And you are welcome to use

203
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,446
the gamification and use the concept in

204
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:01,540
your enterprises. Thank you.
