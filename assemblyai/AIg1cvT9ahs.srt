00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,334
Welcome everybody to the talk about implementing of GnEi in

2
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:28,314
banking context. I will be speaking from practical and

3
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:31,898
business perspective because currently I am chief product officer of the company

4
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:35,174
which created geneae solution for the bank.

5
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:40,534
We actually had a lot of communication with the banks around

6
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,414
leveraging AI in banking environment.

7
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:50,570
Firstly, we'll discuss about context and use case overall.

8
00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:54,498
Then we'll go into short description

9
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:58,192
of the product. Then we'll have a deeper dive of

10
00:00:58,248 --> 00:01:00,004
technical aspects of product,

11
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:06,024
how was it created? And then we'll

12
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:10,440
discuss the frequent concerns of the banks of launch

13
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:14,056
product within the banking environment. And in the end,

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,336
we'll speak about the team which is required to

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,084
create such kind of solution. So let's start.

16
00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:26,204
If we are talking about potential market of

17
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:29,836
software for the banks, it is really huge. It is

18
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,864
more than $4 billion.

19
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:38,252
It is just a service addressable market,

20
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:41,972
but actually it is much larger. We believe

21
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:43,784
that this market is growing.

22
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:48,572
At this market, we focus on actually

23
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:52,980
two solutions. Our company focuses on two problems.

24
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:56,972
The first problem is that when you try to open account in

25
00:01:56,988 --> 00:02:00,500
a bank for your business, this takes a

26
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:03,796
lot of time. Like according to our survey, it is seven

27
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,484
days and more than 400 pounds per

28
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:11,140
one customer. Also, we know that there is

29
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:15,076
a huge problem with transaction monitoring and why

30
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,464
so. And according to our research,

31
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:23,160
if we look at the onboarding process of

32
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:27,432
business customers for the bank, you can see that some

33
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:31,404
parts of this process is very much automated. It is

34
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:35,504
like verification in registers, identity verifications,

35
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:40,200
et cetera, et cetera. But there is a part which I

36
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:43,680
colored green, which is very difficult

37
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:47,794
to automate. And this part is related to two things. The first thing is

38
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,966
back and forth clarification. For example, you ask customer to

39
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,086
provide a contract. Customer provided to you.

40
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,870
Your manager read the contract and realized that the

41
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:02,038
contract is expired and you need the fresh

42
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:05,510
one. And you write a message, could you please provide the new

43
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:09,366
contract? And this usually takes two days. It is

44
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,542
a significant amount of time. And secondly,

45
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:16,410
actually reading of the loan documents take a lot of time.

46
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:20,170
Sometimes contracts provided to the banks could

47
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:24,538
be 50 pages, 100 pages. And you

48
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:28,450
can imagine how much time managers

49
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:32,894
spend on reading such documents. And our product actually

50
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:37,466
resolves this issue and it

51
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,442
is not covered by the current players yet.

52
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:43,764
And what we are doing, we launched

53
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:48,576
a system which

54
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,804
is talking to customer in chat. It is AI

55
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:56,724
powered chatbot. It collects documents,

56
00:03:57,424 --> 00:04:00,484
it extracts data from documents,

57
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:06,312
does all the checks which are required and prepare compliance

58
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:10,610
report. And this compliance report looks like

59
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:13,842
this. You can see that in this report we

60
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:17,254
provide all the discrepancies found in the documents,

61
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:21,934
all the issues, all communications from customer

62
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:26,170
around it. And in the end compliance officer, the person who is

63
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:29,690
making decision about open account just read

64
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:33,202
our report and take decision to open

65
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:37,784
account or do not open account. And it takes for them just

66
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,732
like ten minutes but not seven days as it

67
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,340
was previously. So this is our use case, this is the product we

68
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:49,624
are offering for the banks and

69
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:53,252
this product, the benefits for the banks is of course cost

70
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:57,308
reduction on burden speeds. Customers are happy and

71
00:04:57,356 --> 00:05:01,428
actually many others. And this

72
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:05,180
product is like I will speak a bit

73
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:09,084
more about how was it built from

74
00:05:09,164 --> 00:05:12,620
maybe technical perspective if we try to

75
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:16,464
create such product just based on LLM. As you know,

76
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:21,716
LLM will not have a structured discussion

77
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,180
on some topic. Even if we make very good prompts,

78
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:29,196
very good structure, the stability

79
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,410
and ability to control what is going on will be

80
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:37,474
very low. That's why we decided that

81
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:41,622
we should have a hard coded dialogue

82
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:44,886
scenario. So we should ensure that system

83
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,434
will ask customer for example for

84
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:54,214
registration documents for the company contracts,

85
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:57,926
invoices and if customer has some

86
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,414
questions or would like to discuss anything around these

87
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:06,214
documents, we'll support it. But it will be very well

88
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:10,406
guided dialogue. And you can see that we

89
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,274
have splitted this flow into the

90
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:19,314
small steps. Like for example

91
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:24,126
we tell the task to LLM customers

92
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:29,302
asking us to provide some information about requirements

93
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:33,138
for the invoice and LLM just

94
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,666
answer to this particular small question and this is

95
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,330
small task we are given to LLM. We are not trying to ask you

96
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:44,538
to collect all the data and secondly

97
00:06:44,626 --> 00:06:48,294
we use separate OCR service like

98
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:52,618
the quality is higher and we do not use even llms

99
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,306
for this. And we see that stability is

100
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,108
very good with it. Thirdly, we do extraction

101
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:05,220
and also it is a separate task to the model using

102
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,980
OCR we converted images to

103
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:12,924
text and now we use LLM to

104
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:16,380
extract from this text structured data. We need to

105
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:19,564
make documents analysis and

106
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:23,674
finally we decided that it should be not

107
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:27,386
only LLM and OCR

108
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,786
but also we would like to use APIs to enrich

109
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,386
additional data for this particular case.

110
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,066
So we have integration with registers. For example, we are

111
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,586
taking data from there, comparing this within

112
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,282
data we extracted from the documents and as

113
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:50,852
the result received very well structured

114
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:55,404
reports. If we're talking about integration

115
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:58,380
perspective here,

116
00:07:58,572 --> 00:08:02,492
it is actually a very important concern of the customer. Like when

117
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:07,044
it is a bank, they have very very

118
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:10,852
complicated architecture and

119
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:15,036
with a long history and it is very difficult

120
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,172
and takes a lot of time to to integrate

121
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:22,780
seamlessly in this kind of architecture. That's why for the

122
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:26,820
proof of concept. To make this much faster,

123
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:31,024
we created kind of fast integration approach. It looks like this.

124
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:35,532
For example, bank would like to open a business account for

125
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,212
the customer and customer usually

126
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:43,460
fulfill forms on the website of

127
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:47,224
this bank and they authorized and we have this

128
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:50,784
and we do not integrate into.

129
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:56,188
We do not integrate API using API here.

130
00:08:56,316 --> 00:09:00,428
We just do an iframe integration. So we find some screen and

131
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,584
put it there and it is very fast.

132
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:10,264
Second approach is that our service which is actually

133
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:14,454
creating all of this, which is in the cloud.

134
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:18,002
After user talks

135
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,090
to potential customer of the

136
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:24,354
bank in iframe

137
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:27,594
chat, which is actually our chat, we created

138
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,734
report and we send this report through email.

139
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:35,146
Very straightforward. We can do it of course through API. But as

140
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,854
I mentioned that for the banks it can take a lot of time.

141
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:43,704
Rolling out such kind of fast API

142
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:48,164
takes one week and it is

143
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:52,360
much more interesting for the banks to try

144
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:56,320
our product. Moving on, I mentioned

145
00:09:56,352 --> 00:10:00,352
that we used to face different

146
00:10:00,488 --> 00:10:03,804
concerns to llms and

147
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,376
overall usage of GPT in the bank

148
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,884
environment. And the first concern is for example that

149
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:18,176
most of people believe that OpenAI use

150
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,564
client's data to develop new models.

151
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:26,296
And we prepared special

152
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,128
documents which confirmed that corporate

153
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:34,056
API that

154
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,864
OpenAI declares that they

155
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:42,304
do not use any client's data in

156
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:45,920
corporate API and is protected by agreements and is

157
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:50,280
protected by all necessary

158
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:53,680
policies. And we show this to the

159
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:56,124
customer and usually this helps.

160
00:10:57,264 --> 00:11:00,368
Secondly, many people still

161
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:03,992
believe that chat boxes are not reliable. For example,

162
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:07,304
I have heard such concern. Yes, I like your solution

163
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:10,724
is great, but we like this

164
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,800
part when you are checking the documents, making compliance

165
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:18,640
checks. But this chat is like. I personally don't like

166
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:22,964
chats. Chatbots, can you please implement

167
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:27,104
this kind of dynamic form where a customer can fulfill

168
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,764
some information and get the response, but not in chat.

169
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:34,884
Also very very interesting

170
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:38,940
concern because people still see that chatbots

171
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:44,036
are not reliable. And this is true actually. And what

172
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,404
we can do here, as I mentioned that firstly

173
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:51,264
we made our chart very structured.

174
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:55,412
Also we limited answers

175
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,494
to internal database. So if our chatbot

176
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:03,690
answering to customer, it is not using any information from the Internet,

177
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:08,490
it uses information from

178
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:11,802
the data source which is checked and we are sure that there will

179
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:15,874
be no hallucinations around it. Also we are

180
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:19,218
adding where it is possible, we are adding some

181
00:12:19,386 --> 00:12:23,434
hard coded logic and quick buttons which can skip

182
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:26,952
chat communication where it is not necessary. So I

183
00:12:26,968 --> 00:12:30,352
would not say that we have kind of clear chat.

184
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:33,568
It is mix of chat and hard coded logic.

185
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:37,320
And this helps with banks when

186
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:40,924
we are trying to convince them that this product is good enough.

187
00:12:41,824 --> 00:12:45,224
Number three is the quality. Of course,

188
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:50,736
from the beginning people remember that if

189
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,844
we are talking about machine learning,

190
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:58,528
when you need to read, when you need to

191
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:01,784
read any new document with a high quality,

192
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:05,968
you need to train model on thousands and thousands

193
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:09,480
samples of such documents. And they do not understand that

194
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:13,176
situation has been changed. And actually you do not

195
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,244
need so huge train data to

196
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:22,764
to have a good quality. And we actually support

197
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:26,764
our sales materials with the results

198
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:31,444
of the testing and we suggest

199
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:34,996
them to try their own documents. And after they are trying

200
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,824
this, usually this helps.

201
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:41,340
And number four, I also already

202
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:45,196
mentioned it, but maybe elaborate a bit more. That of

203
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,634
course banks afraid of hard integration

204
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:52,570
and for proof of concept they would like something small what

205
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:56,594
they can try. And we created

206
00:13:56,634 --> 00:14:00,654
this kind of quick integration scheme. And also secondly,

207
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:05,274
we started integrations with the large

208
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:08,994
CRM and compliance case management systems

209
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:13,420
like for example Salesforce and

210
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:16,344
banks which are using Salesforce.

211
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:19,764
When they think about

212
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:23,804
integration and when they understand that this one will be that our

213
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:26,948
product will be part of the Salesforce flow,

214
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:30,356
it is much easier for them to take this decision

215
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,264
to get our solution. And now let's move to

216
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:38,540
the team. Of course it could be different

217
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:42,660
team working on such projects, but I would like to mention a few mission critical

218
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:46,394
roles. I think they are

219
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:50,494
necessary for the success of such product. Of course data scientists

220
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:55,098
and when we're talking about generative AI,

221
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:58,054
the role of data scientists have changed.

222
00:14:58,354 --> 00:15:01,934
It is already more prompt engineering,

223
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:06,494
already more about data extraction from the text

224
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:10,396
and it shifted. But what

225
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,844
is important data scientists from the knowledge perspective,

226
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:18,780
they can structure working on the quality and

227
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:22,532
I think this is critical. They can create a

228
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,116
great data set, they can ensure the quality of the

229
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,028
data set, they can ensure that the labeling

230
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:33,940
process is set up properly and you can test

231
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:35,024
it properly.

232
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:41,334
This role shifted, but it's still the core in this process.

233
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:45,274
Second role, this is actually the new

234
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:48,842
role and I have not heard about this role

235
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:53,186
before this project, but I think it is kind of role

236
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,414
just appeared the previous year.

237
00:15:56,834 --> 00:16:00,770
QA engineer with prompt engineering experience.

238
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:02,854
It's a really interesting mix.

239
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:07,670
The people who can test quality

240
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:11,822
of responses of llms

241
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:14,950
on the high volumes, so they can use,

242
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:18,558
they are very experienced in prompt engineering. They have

243
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:22,254
all the tools which are required and they can write actually these

244
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:26,674
tools for automation of such QA.

245
00:16:28,914 --> 00:16:32,498
This is new role really helping a lot to our

246
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:36,210
product to ensure quality of chat. Duck and

247
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:40,522
number three, of course, back end developer who

248
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:44,682
actually currently can do prompt engineering as well,

249
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:46,934
integration with different models,

250
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,930
but important that this role should be combined with

251
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:55,874
DevOps or it should be a separate person develops on the team.

252
00:16:56,034 --> 00:17:00,084
Because if you need high quality environment for the banks,

253
00:17:00,824 --> 00:17:04,432
your infrastructure should be really great and I

254
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:07,684
would personally recommend to have this role in your team.

255
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:12,336
So to wrap up about my

256
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,088
talk, it is a huge use

257
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:19,536
case for ginia in the banks and it is a

258
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,204
great potential of implementation.

259
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:26,020
The main pain for the banks actually working with a

260
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:29,572
large volume of different documents and different processes. It's not

261
00:17:29,588 --> 00:17:32,676
only compliance process, could be lending process,

262
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,716
credit process and due diligence legal process.

263
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,644
So there are a lot of them. Our company

264
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:44,292
created chatbot which collects and verifies documents for

265
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:47,904
the banks and we have experience in implementing it.

266
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:52,266
Most of the banks do not fully understand the opportunities

267
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,810
and we see that banks

268
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:00,170
actually risk averse organizations and we

269
00:18:00,202 --> 00:18:04,938
hear a lot of concerns and you should be prepared to argue

270
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:08,306
and to provide support that the

271
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,174
risks are not so high. And as a hint

272
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:17,382
to overcome the concerns that prepare maybe

273
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:20,782
responses to frequently asked questions.

274
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:24,918
And second one to have instant

275
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:28,910
proof of concept so you can prove that your solution works.

276
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:33,046
Well, that's it from my side. Thank you very much

277
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,798
and have a nice day.
