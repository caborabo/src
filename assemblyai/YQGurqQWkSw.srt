00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,558
Hi everyone, my name is Pablo. For a quick background, I used to

2
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:27,830
be have a developer, but then I kind of moved to the dark side.

3
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,410
And currently I'm taking care of several teams of developers

4
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,222
and DevOps at CBapoland. And today

5
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:39,378
I would like to tell you a story about generations and generational

6
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:43,110
differences and how it all applies to our industry.

7
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,526
Here's our plan. We'll start with some general information. So what's

8
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:50,762
the concept around the generation? What are the different

9
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:54,314
generations? What's the thing with differences? Is it

10
00:00:54,352 --> 00:00:57,806
all just mess or is it really true? I will give you

11
00:00:57,828 --> 00:01:01,374
some theories about that. And in the second act, we'll move to

12
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:05,250
particular generations and we'll see about those differences.

13
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,442
Also, a disclaimer. There are a lot of memes about

14
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:12,846
generations. We have those boomers and those millennials

15
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:16,898
that are barking at each other. So this is kind of mammical

16
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:21,010
topic. So most of those memes are kind of offensive.

17
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,670
I was trying to bash everyone equally.

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,418
But be advised and just keep your distance or

19
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:32,522
we will all die. For starters, let's look at

20
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:36,650
movie, quick movie that will show you a difference in how people

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,300
born in different decades would react to hitting themselves

22
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,240
in a frame of the door. Let's look at that.

23
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,840
Okay, we have some idea about this.

24
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,190
All right, so let's move on to general information.

25
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,534
What's the generation or demographic cohort?

26
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:59,026
Do those differences even exist? Or they are just

27
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:02,500
myths? And what are the theories about this?

28
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,446
The idea of generation or demographic cohort

29
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,714
is the ideas. We understand it. So boomers,

30
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:13,634
millennials, those ideas, we know it is kind of connected with a western

31
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:17,206
world. What is a western world? Well, it kind

32
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:21,142
of changed over time. Like, for instance, Poland was initially in the eastern

33
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:24,170
bloc and moved to the western bloc.

34
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,934
In general, there's an idea that we can kind of segment

35
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,810
the population to those cohorts that are roughly

36
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,982
20 years long. And the idea is that

37
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,750
when we are young, when we are up to 20 years old,

38
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,194
the events that take place, the technology that is

39
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:47,986
currently developing that we are using shapes us.

40
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,410
Of course, we can adapt at later ages to that,

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,930
but mostly the impact is during the first 20

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,594
years of our life. You can

43
00:02:58,632 --> 00:03:02,342
find some references to early

44
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:06,086
ideas, early topics around that. Up to 100 years ago,

45
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:10,234
Karl Mannheim was working on that in Germany. You can

46
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:13,542
find some sources dating back to 1952,

47
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:16,234
53, something like that,

48
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:19,542
because that was when works of car were translated

49
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:23,674
to English. And I can see some pictures here. So some, let's say

50
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:27,534
milestones of in technology, but also global events might

51
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:31,374
be wondering what's up with this boat there. So the

52
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:34,814
idea is that the boat is kind of like

53
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:38,018
a shotgun over the fireplace in the first act.

54
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:41,090
If you see the shotgun over those fireplace in the first act,

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,594
then you know that somewhere at the end of the story, somebody will take this

56
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:48,006
shotgun and fire from this. So we will get to

57
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,526
those boat and we will be proving at the

58
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:54,120
end of our story. So stay with me.

59
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,054
So, in order to be on the same page,

60
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:01,338
what is the meaning of those particular generations? This is

61
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:04,986
the image taken from Wikipedia. A little bit enhanced. On the

62
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:08,902
right, you have ages of particular generation,

63
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:12,470
right? So alphas are currently several years old. Then we

64
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,350
have generation z, which is roughly ten to 26.

65
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,430
We have millennials, which are 27, 26 to 42,

66
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,446
more or less. We have generation x, which is 42 to 58.

67
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:28,494
Baby boomers, 58 to 77. We have the silent generation,

68
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,906
which is over 77 years old. By the way,

69
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:35,282
disclaimer, don't be attached too much to those numbers because

70
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:38,822
they vary depending on the source. Sometimes it's one,

71
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:42,214
two, three, even five years into one

72
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:45,842
or the other direction. So this is more or less the consensus,

73
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:49,402
but it's not always very strict. So, regarding the

74
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,510
geometry of this picture of this trapezoid,

75
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,906
we have the date of birth. Then we are going to

76
00:04:56,928 --> 00:05:00,454
18 years old, or starting the productive

77
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:03,710
period, let's say. Then we are going roughly to 60,

78
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,774
and then the shape is proving to 70. So the end

79
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:11,182
of the productive period, of course, we would like to live out a little bit

80
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:15,214
more than that. So in reality, there should be, say a tail

81
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:19,374
at the end. But this is in general to give you more or less understanding

82
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:23,250
of the timeframes of particular generations.

83
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,922
So, to visualize how it looks in a population.

84
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:32,182
So, for example, this is a population of Poland, probably would be something

85
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:35,766
similar in the western countries. So we

86
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:39,594
can see that we have this red peak of baby boomers just

87
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:43,354
after the end of born, after the end of

88
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:46,922
world War two. Then it's dropping into the

89
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:50,614
x generation, then it's starting to rise

90
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:55,098
again. We have older exes and

91
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:59,034
younger millennials around the second baby

92
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:02,446
boom, then it's dropping again. We have generation Z and

93
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:06,094
generation Alpha. We would expect to rise again into

94
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,586
the third baby boom. However, we have some changes

95
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:13,250
currently in, say, approach to having children.

96
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,138
Not many people want to have a lot of children, so it kind of flattened

97
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:20,966
at the end. So how this relates to an

98
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:25,042
article, technology industry. So here we have two examples.

99
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:28,570
Start with a software house in Poland.

100
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,300
We have a distribution of people.

101
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,302
What's kind of striking is that most of them are generation

102
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:41,638
Y. So millennials, roughly 80% are

103
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:45,406
millennials. We have a little bit of generation z on

104
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:48,846
the right, the green color, and we have a little bit

105
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:52,080
of generation x on the left, the orange color.

106
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,334
Then the second example is a software house, or rather consulting

107
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:00,114
company from Netherlands. It looks similar,

108
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:03,394
a little bit different. We have, say,

109
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:07,074
the dominance of millennials, generation Y. We have

110
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:10,998
a little bit of generation Z, but we have much more of generation X

111
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:15,126
and just a few of boomers at the far left with

112
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:18,714
the red color. The reason for that is that because the

113
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:22,234
industry started a bit earlier, Netherlands, and also

114
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:25,130
this particular company is more consulting.

115
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,514
It's more on the consulting side. So they rather hire a little

116
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:33,594
bit more senior people. So there is not too many people from generation

117
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:37,486
Z. But just to give you a general overview, most of

118
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:41,680
the people in it currently are millennials. Generation Y.

119
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,390
What's the idea with those myths and facts?

120
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,474
If you google for generational differences, you will

121
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:53,410
get a lot of materials saying that, hey, boomers are like this,

122
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,006
millennials are like this, you should do this or that in order

123
00:07:57,048 --> 00:08:00,680
to handle them. On the other hand, if you google for

124
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,854
generational differences myths, then you will find a lot of

125
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:08,374
articles saying that this is all bullshit. Everyone is equal. We shouldn't

126
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:11,430
discriminate based on age or the generations.

127
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,098
And now the question arises, which one is true?

128
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:19,100
Probably the answer is something in between,

129
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,034
right? If you look at the price from last several

130
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:26,190
decades, you can see the pattern that the younger generation,

131
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,030
which was the baby boomers, maybe in seventy s, then generation x,

132
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,286
then millennials, generation z, this younger

133
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:38,098
generation, agoistic, those mid generation, they want everything

134
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,314
to themselves and don't have respect for

135
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:44,562
their elders, et cetera. And it kind of repeats over time,

136
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:48,326
right? Each younger generation is kind of treated like the same.

137
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:52,002
If you look at some scientific papers,

138
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:54,818
you can see a lot of articles on the generations,

139
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:58,454
conflicts that arise like 3000 years ago,

140
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:02,134
2000 years ago, some ancient athens, some medieval times,

141
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:05,914
France, in United States, in Africa, all over

142
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:09,386
the place. So all over the place, those different generations kind

143
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:13,374
of clashed against each other. We have this idea of

144
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:17,562
generational narcissism. So we kind of assume

145
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:21,354
that our generation is the best, right? Those younger

146
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:24,734
are immature, they don't know how to live. They have no

147
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,462
respect. Those older ones kind of stopped

148
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,178
progress. It's difficult to talk to them. And we kind of in the

149
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:36,174
middle. We are the best generation. You can see the quote that was found

150
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:39,670
over 3000 years ago on the clay tablet.

151
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,150
And also, if you read little bit of research, especially over

152
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,866
20 or 30 years. You can notice that usually we

153
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:52,134
have four generations on the work market. And it's usually divided

154
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:55,434
into two halves. We have two younger generations and

155
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:57,210
we have two older generations.

156
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,226
Those younger generations are immature. They don't

157
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:07,086
know their life, they have no respect. Older one are kind

158
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:10,682
of like the last adult generation. So usually the younger generation

159
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:14,858
from those two oldest. So currently it would be the x generations

160
00:10:14,954 --> 00:10:19,010
are described as those last adult generation currently research.

161
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,246
But if you look like 20 years ago or something like that, the baby

162
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,414
boomers were the last adult generation and the exes were those

163
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:31,106
still immature and generation without respect

164
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:34,706
for their elders. So it is kind of shifting.

165
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:38,794
The perception of generation is shifting with time.

166
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:42,506
To make matters more complicated, it changed as

167
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:45,830
we age, right? So our personality,

168
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,426
based on, let's say, the genetic lottery, what kinds of genes

169
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,320
we get, what is our neural system,

170
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,200
and also how we were raised for the first 20 years,

171
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,898
say the most forming factor. So most

172
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:07,618
of our personality forms up to 20 years ago, 20 years old.

173
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:11,634
However, over the next roughly 30 years

174
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,974
or something like that, from 20 to 50, there are also

175
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:18,726
some changes. So as we age, we get

176
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:21,650
more conscientiousness, so more orderly.

177
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,478
We have those life figure out more or less. Let's say

178
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:29,014
we are more agreeable, so it's a bit easier to

179
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:32,474
negotiate with us. Maybe we are even getting a little

180
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:35,466
bit of naive if we speak about older people.

181
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:38,970
On the other hand, our openness is going down.

182
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,590
So we have our schemes, our approach to doing

183
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,682
things, and we are not that open to new experiences.

184
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:50,094
Our extraversion usually goes down, right? So if you are 20

185
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,282
years old, going for a pub crowd is a great idea.

186
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:57,106
If you are 40, maybe you should get a little bit more

187
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:58,660
sleep or something like this.

188
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,178
Also, our neuroticism goes down. Neuroticism is

189
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:07,790
the measure of how uncertain you are about the external words,

190
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,602
how afraid you are, what is the level of your emotions,

191
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,806
strong emotions, stuff like this. So as we age in general,

192
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:18,342
we are tending to get more stable. So our neuroticism

193
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:21,180
goes down. We can say that,

194
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,786
we can describe it that with age, just stop to

195
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:29,446
care that much about what others think about this. And it's

196
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:32,080
kind of healthy to an extent, of course.

197
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,110
And to make things even more complicated,

198
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,906
there are other factors at play. So international differences

199
00:12:40,938 --> 00:12:44,926
is one thing, but also we have cultural differences. So depending

200
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,414
on where you were born, whether it was United States, Germany,

201
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:52,306
Japan, Poland, anything else, you have a different baseline of

202
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:55,906
behavior. And those cultures differ in many dimensions.

203
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:59,158
And probably the most important thing is

204
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:03,158
individual difference. Right? So we have this personal

205
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:06,646
preferences, how your nervous system was formed over the

206
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:10,502
first 20 years of your life. And those is the most important factor.

207
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:14,810
And just somewhere in the background over those two,

208
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,442
we have also general differences that

209
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:22,154
have some statistical impact. But you know how it is with statistics.

210
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,766
If I go for a talks with my dog,

211
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:27,150
statistically we have those legs.

212
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,040
So use it a little bit. No, the idea is that

213
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,886
the whole point of this chapter is that there are some statistical

214
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:41,406
generational differences, but we have to use it with caution.

215
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:45,534
Right. Don't use it as a hammer labeled millennial

216
00:13:45,582 --> 00:13:48,680
or boomer and just use it on everyone. In the same way.

217
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,838
I think it should be rather used as a delicate tool

218
00:13:52,924 --> 00:13:56,600
in your people skills arsenal just to have this

219
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:01,126
understanding that there are some differences, but don't rely too

220
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:04,986
much on them. Let's move on the second act of our story.

221
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:09,158
So we talk a little bit about our particular generations

222
00:14:09,254 --> 00:14:12,000
and how to deal with them. General.

223
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,350
So we start as a framing device. We start with the silent generation.

224
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,398
So those are people who are currently over 77

225
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:24,010
years old. So probably you won't put

226
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,826
as many of them as in our industry. They are

227
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:30,610
mostly retired by now, with some exception.

228
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,446
Old ceos or some people in corporation don't

229
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:37,974
just stay there forever. Wouldn't like to focus too much

230
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:41,206
on them just as a framing device. But I would like to give you

231
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:45,094
some examples from our industry. So we have Sir

232
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:48,646
Gordon Moore. So the famous Moore's

233
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:52,026
law about the power of processors growing over time.

234
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:55,770
And also co founder of intel. We have Margaret Hamilton,

235
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,090
who was writing a software for Apollo spacecraft and also

236
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,286
did a lot of research papers. We have Donald

237
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:07,150
notes, who is called the father of algorithm analysis.

238
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,630
He's still writing this book about the art of computer programming started

239
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,330
somewhere in the 60s. We have Barbara Liskov.

240
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,878
So from this name we have Liskov substitution principle,

241
00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:22,578
the solid acronym. But she also had a

242
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:26,946
lot of contribution to the scientific field of computer science.

243
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:31,286
We have Alan Kay, who is known for

244
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:35,602
working on the first graphical user interfaces even before Microsoft

245
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,226
and Google and decided to borrow them. And also he is

246
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:42,166
the inventor of the small talk language.

247
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,438
We have Brian Kerrigan and Ken Thompson, who worked on Unix,

248
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:50,230
wrote the first book about C C

249
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,238
language. Ken Thompson is also an author of

250
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:57,998
Go language. And we have Larry Ellison, who is one

251
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:01,630
of the founders of the Oracle Corporation. So those are

252
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,394
all people from the silent generation and

253
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:09,758
move on to the baby boomers. So baby boomers

254
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:13,378
born just after the World War II. So currently

255
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:16,670
age between roughly 58 77.

256
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,326
We can kind of call them the analog generation. So when

257
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:23,606
they were starting to work, we were using pen and

258
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:27,906
paper, not computers. But of course, over time they migrated

259
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:31,702
to digital technology as well. Some differences

260
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:35,622
for baby boomers. So we had a cold war in the full swing.

261
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:39,542
So we never knew if you wouldn't be obliterated by the atomic

262
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:42,910
bomb blast. At some points, we had the landing on the moon.

263
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,002
Technology wise, the television started to be widespread,

264
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:50,602
maybe more in western countries, not necessarily

265
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:54,434
in Poland in particular. In eastern countries, on the other

266
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:58,466
hand, we have this growing communism with

267
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:02,114
the Cold War. If you ask Americans, they would

268
00:17:02,152 --> 00:17:06,422
probably say that assassination of JFK was kind of the event that

269
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:10,066
impacted their life. And computers

270
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:13,574
are basically just starting to be used, right?

271
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:17,030
So they are rather used by scientists in white coats, not really

272
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,940
in mainstream business yet.

273
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,126
So what's the approach to baby boomers?

274
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:27,370
So baby boomers kind of like the face to face conversations.

275
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,834
They have the high power distance, meaning that if you have some formal

276
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:35,550
title, such as manager, maybe even a doctor,

277
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:40,686
you are being granted the respect out of the box value

278
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:44,574
structure, hierarchy, loyalty. Often they worked their

279
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:48,340
whole life or a large portion of their life in a single company.

280
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,194
They also value hard skills, right? So what you can do

281
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:55,922
technically what you are skilled at, not necessarily soft

282
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:59,400
skills. So how smoothly you can talk and stuff like this.

283
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,582
If you want to make them happy,

284
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:07,350
you can put them in some formal position of power.

285
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,354
So give them some formal title, such as senior just

286
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:14,954
manager, et cetera, and give them some opportunity to

287
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:18,874
mentor younger colleagues and show

288
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:22,886
them the business and stuff like this. Some example of baby

289
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:26,290
boomers. In it we have Biann Strozrop,

290
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,978
the author of C Plus plus, we have Steve Wozniak.

291
00:18:29,994 --> 00:18:33,850
From Apple, we have James Gosling, the author of Java language,

292
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,546
Bill Gates. From Microsoft, we have Guido von

293
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:41,326
Rosso, the author of Python language, Tim Cook.

294
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:44,942
And from Apple, we have Anders

295
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:48,130
Heidezberg, who is the author of C Sharp language.

296
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,470
And we have Jeff Bezos,

297
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,170
the bookseller and also the virtual machine seller

298
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,082
Amazon. So let's move on to our next

299
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:01,530
generation, X generation,

300
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,994
born after 65, so currently roughly 42

301
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:09,498
to 50 air, 58 years old. The name

302
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:13,582
came from the unknown. X is the unknown. So world

303
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:16,640
was changing quite fast, new technology.

304
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,082
We didn't really know how this generation

305
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:23,460
will turn out. There was a book,

306
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,694
the X generation. There was a song,

307
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:31,474
the X Generation, and kind of somehow stuck. We can

308
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:35,406
also call them digital immigrants. So it's

309
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:39,026
often the case that when they were young, the world was more analog.

310
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:43,302
So pen and paper. And only after some

311
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:46,706
20 years or something, they started to use computers,

312
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:50,554
or maybe not even yet computers, but let's say more of

313
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:54,202
an electronics and digital world. Sometimes they are called

314
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:57,562
latchkey keys. So because of the social changes,

315
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,274
parents tend to work a bit longer. And those were

316
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:04,502
more divorces. So there were more single parents. And often

317
00:20:04,576 --> 00:20:08,142
children have to come back to an empty house. So they had those

318
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:11,726
key around at their neck, and they have to open the

319
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:14,702
doors themselves. In those United States,

320
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:18,298
you can sometimes see the name, the MTV generation and

321
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:21,986
the current research, you can see the name that they

322
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:25,362
are the last adult generations. Those generation

323
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:28,360
younger are still not adult yet.

324
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,120
This is about generation. The idea about generations X.

325
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,366
What were the influences of Generation X?

326
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:39,290
So, in Poland, we had the martial law

327
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,366
in 1981. In general, the dissolution of Soviet

328
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:45,820
Union at the end of the Cold War,

329
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:51,030
the disaster in Chernobyl, 1986. Most influence

330
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,682
on the Eastern Europe. They have some first computers,

331
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:57,840
like Commodore, Atari, Amiga, stuff like this.

332
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,834
Pop culture is coming to Eastern Europe, the western

333
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:05,442
culture regarding cell phones, it's still rather a thing

334
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:09,054
of. Maybe some executives or directors

335
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,546
are using those brick like phones that we

336
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:15,954
have here. I saw the walkman that was quite popular

337
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:19,894
at those times. So how to deal with Generation X

338
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:23,490
then? So exers tend to be very autonomous,

339
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,682
right? Sometimes it's connected with the statistical upbringing.

340
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:31,414
Like if they needed to get back alone to

341
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:35,066
home, they kind of develop those sense of autonomy. So they

342
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:38,966
want to do stuff on their own, not necessarily

343
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:42,186
with the team or other people. They're quite focused

344
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,854
on results. So they want to know where

345
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:49,486
they are currently, where they are going, how fast, what are

346
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:53,086
the tools at their disposal, and kind of have the ability to

347
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:56,702
measure the progress. They still kind of feel

348
00:21:56,756 --> 00:22:00,926
this authority to people that I hire in the hierarchy,

349
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:04,418
but not as strong as baby boomers. They still like a

350
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:07,954
little bit of. To have a little bit of rules and procedures around that.

351
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:11,830
They're quite focused on the career. So often they say that,

352
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,978
hey, I'm a manager, I'm a software developer,

353
00:22:15,074 --> 00:22:18,854
not that I'm a pava or John or any

354
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:22,634
other person. So they are kind of prone to

355
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:26,106
burnout, like if you are a manager or team leader or

356
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:29,914
just a good colleague, it's good to look for those symptoms if

357
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:33,486
they are not really working too much, too hard on

358
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:36,320
the path to burnout. So be careful with that.

359
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,026
Some examples from our industry. We have Michael Dell,

360
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,438
the producer of computers and hardware.

361
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:47,634
We have Satya modela from Microsoft. Currently we

362
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:51,758
have Rasmus Lerdorf, who is the author of PHP language,

363
00:22:51,854 --> 00:22:56,006
Linus Torvald. So first, Linux and Git, we have

364
00:22:56,028 --> 00:22:59,794
John Carmack from the gaming industry, Quake of Stein,

365
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:04,150
doom, stuff like this. We have Elon Musk, let's say,

366
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,502
from Tesla and SpaceX,

367
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:11,094
and currently being a great manager,

368
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:14,586
or Twitter or X, or however it is called. Now we

369
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:18,774
have Larry Page from Google, or Alphabet

370
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:22,366
rather. And we have Jack Dorsey, who is actually the

371
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:25,934
founder of Twitter. All right, so let's move

372
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:29,758
to our millennial Austin, born after more or

373
00:23:29,764 --> 00:23:32,926
less 1981. So currently 27 to

374
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:37,154
42, more or less years old. Why the

375
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:40,674
name? Why? Kind of stems from the fact that

376
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,842
millennials like to know why they do things like those.

377
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:47,094
It's not enough to tell them to do things. They need to know the reason.

378
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,862
And it's better be some sensible reason.

379
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,440
Sometimes they are called 90s kids.

380
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,306
Disclaimer here, 90 skits is not about being born

381
00:23:56,338 --> 00:24:00,362
in the SE, it's about being kid in the.

382
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:03,690
If somebody was born in 1999 and says

383
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,434
that he or she's a 90s kids, you can a little bit

384
00:24:07,552 --> 00:24:11,118
frown upon this. Milayas are also sometimes

385
00:24:11,204 --> 00:24:15,182
called digital natives. So usually computers were

386
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:18,494
quite widespread when they were children.

387
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:22,270
Computers, but not really on Internet or online

388
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,700
presence. So they are a little bit more used to technology

389
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,142
and to the digital stuff. What are some other influences?

390
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:33,874
So we have the first Internet when millennials were young or in their

391
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:37,510
teens. So we have this great example

392
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,442
of dialing attempt with a modern. We have a globalization

393
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:45,014
in full swing. So more countries are joining NATO and

394
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:48,774
European Union in general. The cold war is over and

395
00:24:48,892 --> 00:24:52,570
war seems to be quite at peace. We have this

396
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,210
30 years of globalization and global peace, which is currently going

397
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,114
maybe to an end because the

398
00:25:01,152 --> 00:25:04,826
situation is quite not very stable at the moment. But while millennials

399
00:25:04,858 --> 00:25:09,710
were young, it was very peaceful. We have some first social

400
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,078
networks on Facebook. Gigi was a communicator,

401
00:25:13,274 --> 00:25:16,370
those messenger in Poland specifically,

402
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,902
we have some first really accessible smartphones

403
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:23,330
that were really kind of more interesting than whatever we have now.

404
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,806
Smartphone is basically the same as another. If you

405
00:25:26,828 --> 00:25:30,866
ask Americans about some experiences

406
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:34,694
of that time, we'll probably hear about 911. This is

407
00:25:34,732 --> 00:25:37,986
kind of like a point between millennials and

408
00:25:38,028 --> 00:25:41,350
Generation Z, because the oldest Z generations,

409
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:45,334
people from Z generations were around four years old when 911

410
00:25:45,382 --> 00:25:48,986
happened. So they usually don't remember that. If you

411
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:52,494
remember what you were doing at this time, you are millennial or

412
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:55,834
older generation, some other electronics.

413
00:25:55,882 --> 00:25:59,534
So we have a discount here. Computers are quite popular, as I mentioned.

414
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:03,838
And the economic crisis was also after

415
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:07,410
2008, 2009 had

416
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,654
quite a lot of impact on lives of many millennials,

417
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,620
especially when they were starting to look for a job.

418
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,840
It was not that easy back then.

419
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:22,422
So how to deal with millennials? So millennials are probably

420
00:26:22,476 --> 00:26:26,002
the most educated generation so far. For instance,

421
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:30,234
in Poland in 1990, there was 300,000 students,

422
00:26:30,352 --> 00:26:33,914
but just 15 years later, there was over 2 million.

423
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,622
So millennials like technology. There's this term,

424
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:41,162
helicopter parents. So often it was the case

425
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:45,082
that parents of millennials were helping, going into the chopper,

426
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:48,382
getting the chopper into the helicopter, flying to their

427
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:52,014
chill, to help them in some difficult situations. So millennials are maybe

428
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:55,746
statistically not that autonomous as

429
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:58,690
the X generation. They like to work in teams.

430
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:04,382
There are also the first generation who really appreciated

431
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:07,910
the life work balance. So they are not really working to

432
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,814
work, just to life. And it's good to have some life besides work.

433
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:15,654
So they are not that keen to do

434
00:27:15,692 --> 00:27:18,710
overtime compared to excess. Again, on average,

435
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,490
they have much lower power distance. Right. So my boss is rather my

436
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,330
body. Not necessarily very formal approach.

437
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,806
And they're generally more flexible than an earlier generation, more geared

438
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:34,814
toward teamwork. They like to spend some time

439
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:38,346
on their personal brands. It's often the case that they are freelancers,

440
00:27:38,378 --> 00:27:42,126
because it gives them more flexibility to work at whatever hours they

441
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:45,380
want. For instance, they are more open to changes,

442
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,682
they are more direct and general, more open to

443
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:54,398
new experiences. Some examples of influential

444
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:57,854
known people from millennial

445
00:27:57,902 --> 00:28:01,386
generation in technology so we have Ryan Dal,

446
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:04,578
who is the author of Node Js. We have Zankimik,

447
00:28:04,594 --> 00:28:08,326
who is the founder of TikTok. Daniel actor,

448
00:28:08,358 --> 00:28:11,754
the founder of Spotify. Mark Zuckerberg, probably most well

449
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:15,574
known person here from Facebook. Mela Iparkis

450
00:28:15,622 --> 00:28:18,982
from Canva, those designer software,

451
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:22,586
Patrick Collison from Stripe, Whitney Wolfhardt

452
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,434
from Tinder and Bumble,

453
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:29,390
and Yvonne Spiegel from Snapchat,

454
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,030
so we can move on to our next generation.

455
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,266
Traditional Z is mostly just entering the work market,

456
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:42,194
at least older of them. They are between ten and

457
00:28:42,232 --> 00:28:46,434
26 years old, sometimes not very creatively

458
00:28:46,482 --> 00:28:50,440
known as post millennials. Snowflakes, that's the term from

459
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,346
sometimes can be attributed to like a snowflake server

460
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:59,554
in it. So every server has a different configuration. Also every member

461
00:28:59,602 --> 00:29:02,620
of those nation, those unique individual are different.

462
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,570
Sometimes called zoomers, the playworth of boomers,

463
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,846
three c's. So connect, communicate,

464
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:13,114
change, and we can call them the online natives,

465
00:29:13,162 --> 00:29:17,214
because the Internet and those online world was there since

466
00:29:17,252 --> 00:29:20,926
the beginning, since they were born. They are used to be online.

467
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:25,026
They are used to is that everything is basically to

468
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:28,654
be found in the Internet, some influences,

469
00:29:28,782 --> 00:29:33,026
right? So probably the greatest influence for

470
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:36,834
generation Z was the Covid-19 pandemic. So there was those remote

471
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:40,662
schooling, maybe finding the first job remotely. The world

472
00:29:40,716 --> 00:29:44,290
kind of has shifted around generations

473
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,346
that are used to having this technology at

474
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:52,234
the fingertips of smartphones. With all those access to all

475
00:29:52,272 --> 00:29:56,874
the knowledge of humanity. Basically we

476
00:29:56,912 --> 00:30:00,570
are kind of nearing those end of 30 years

477
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,158
peace period right after the end of Cold War. So currently

478
00:30:04,244 --> 00:30:08,586
the geopolitics is getting tricky. We have some contenders

479
00:30:08,778 --> 00:30:12,998
for the world order as we had after the World War II.

480
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:16,930
And times are not very stable.

481
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,970
We have some next social

482
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,662
network. So Snapchat, basically, when I was doing this presentation,

483
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:29,560
when I was doing some research, I found out that Snapchat is no longer,

484
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,434
let's say no longer those newest social network,

485
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:37,880
and it's still stuck on a Facebook level. So TikTok is more.

486
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,762
Also, what's important for generations is that they are more

487
00:30:42,816 --> 00:30:46,700
focused on environment, more environment conscious. So we see that

488
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,874
over our previous decades,

489
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:54,522
basically what happened is that the climate was changed,

490
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,322
right? We have this extreme weather phenomena.

491
00:30:57,386 --> 00:31:01,760
Currently, the current generation is more aware of that.

492
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,882
It's kind of important matter for them compared to

493
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:10,414
some earlier generation. Of course, again, on average,

494
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:14,558
statistically, we have a great polarization

495
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:19,526
currently, political polarization. So we have those people to

496
00:31:19,548 --> 00:31:23,494
simplify, people on the left, on the right. And it's even more difficult to

497
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:27,350
talk between those two groups compared to years ago.

498
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,134
And it's even more fueled by social media because there's

499
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,658
controversy. If there are different bubbles, there's a

500
00:31:35,664 --> 00:31:39,770
lot of discussion, a lot of hate speech, et cetera, generates a lot of traffic

501
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,062
and ads like that. So it's not helping us. It's getting

502
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:48,122
difficult. And we have technology that starts resembling

503
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:51,678
magic, basically, especially after, especially last

504
00:31:51,764 --> 00:31:55,170
one or two years with the advances in AI,

505
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,650
it's a kind of different world. So how to deal with

506
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,994
Generation Z then? So Generation Z is even more

507
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:06,246
educated than the previous generation. We have a

508
00:32:06,268 --> 00:32:10,422
lot of knowledge at our fingertips because basically whatever

509
00:32:10,476 --> 00:32:14,402
you want to learn, if it's a front end framework

510
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:18,166
or how to cook some meal or how

511
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:21,554
to do your tie, you can find a tutorial on YouTube somewhere

512
00:32:21,602 --> 00:32:24,986
there. So just need to look and grab for that.

513
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:28,070
Generations Z is used to globalization and diversity.

514
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,766
So they have friends all over those place, basically online,

515
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,286
different countries, people are different. And it's kind of natural for them.

516
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,740
They're very individual. They have a very

517
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,134
different approach to different things as

518
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:44,850
compared to previous generation.

519
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,634
As of workplace, the workplace is no longer some

520
00:32:49,672 --> 00:32:52,738
subplace where you have to go to make money. It can be fun.

521
00:32:52,824 --> 00:32:56,630
You can cheer in there. It's kind of more civilized.

522
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,046
Also, generation Z kind of looks for

523
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:05,286
the greater cost in their work. So basically,

524
00:33:05,388 --> 00:33:09,180
if the company is doing something else

525
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,514
besides earning money, like takes care of the environment or

526
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:16,666
some local communities, et cetera, it's more attractive for

527
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:19,894
generation Z. Some kind of

528
00:33:19,952 --> 00:33:23,246
gamification at work or in the recruitment process might

529
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:26,670
be helpful. Generation Z is also even

530
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,334
more entrepreneurial than previous generation because they

531
00:33:30,372 --> 00:33:33,726
have a lot of tools to monetize, right? They are used

532
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:37,106
to social media. You can create some content, get those money

533
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:40,834
from that. If you have some hobbu where you're buying some not

534
00:33:40,872 --> 00:33:44,526
very typical stuff, maybe some paintings, some figures,

535
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:48,262
stuff like this. Maybe you can set up a small shop and sell

536
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:51,480
some access that you have. It's quite easy right now.

537
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,174
For generation Z, the quick feedback loop is important.

538
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:59,174
Again, probably it might be something connected with social media where

539
00:33:59,212 --> 00:34:03,146
you write something and then you get some reactions and comments. So if

540
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:06,234
you are a team leader or a boss, you shouldn't be waiting one year

541
00:34:06,272 --> 00:34:09,786
to give any feedback to number of generations. It should be

542
00:34:09,808 --> 00:34:13,562
shorter, quicker, some appreciation, like just even liking

543
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:16,750
some message on work teams or stuff like this,

544
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,874
it's helpful. And for Gen Z, the hierarchy

545
00:34:20,922 --> 00:34:24,110
flattens even more. So if you are a formal boss,

546
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,094
well, it has some meaning, but not a lot of meaning.

547
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:31,826
In fact, you have to earn your respect to be respected by

548
00:34:31,848 --> 00:34:35,090
Gen Z. It's not just a formal title, formal hierarchy.

549
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,670
And you might expect that I will give you another eight people

550
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,126
from the next generation that were influential. I was trying to

551
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:47,400
find them, but it seems that it's just a little bit too early.

552
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,654
There's a lot of Gen Z people that are running some very successful startups.

553
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:54,060
They are just not that big.

554
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:58,634
So that we know which one of them, we really

555
00:34:58,672 --> 00:35:02,222
have some kind of impact on our world.

556
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:06,350
So maybe when I will be doing this presentation in five years, ten years,

557
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,614
then we'll see. I hope I will be adding some

558
00:35:09,652 --> 00:35:12,490
people here. And our last generation,

559
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:16,706
I won't be focusing on them too much because they are just few years old.

560
00:35:16,888 --> 00:35:20,100
Don't know yet how they will approach the work.

561
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,786
They might just assume that, hey, they can install some application on

562
00:35:24,808 --> 00:35:28,342
a smartphone, because before they are able to walk or something.

563
00:35:28,396 --> 00:35:31,750
So it's going to be tricky. We still have several years

564
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,554
to prepare our workplaces for the generation alpha.

565
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:39,014
We'll see. I promised you

566
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:42,742
a boat that will be rolling a boat presentation.

567
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:46,554
So here we are as a boat. Let's do

568
00:35:46,592 --> 00:35:50,522
an experiment in mind. Experiment with different generations. How different

569
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:54,450
generations would approach being told to roll

570
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,882
the boat. So let's start with boomers. We have a captain.

571
00:35:57,946 --> 00:36:00,640
We have a crew of boomers. The captain says,

572
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,230
start proving. And the boomers would say,

573
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,706
okay, boss, this is enough. If you

574
00:36:08,728 --> 00:36:11,618
take the X generation, we have the X.

575
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:15,054
We have those, captain, we have the X crew. The captain

576
00:36:15,102 --> 00:36:18,950
says, let's roll. The crew might

577
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,722
say, hey, wait, captain, what's our target?

578
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:26,242
Where are we going? What's our speed? Do we have a device

579
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:29,914
to measure our speed? What's those direction? How fast should we go?

580
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:33,754
What's the deadline? So how fast should we rowing? If they get

581
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:37,978
this information, it will be much easier if they have this control

582
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:41,946
and those sense of target. Let's move

583
00:36:41,968 --> 00:36:45,330
to millennials. Let's assume that we have this millennial screw.

584
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:48,702
The captain says, we are rowing. Millennial would

585
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:52,794
say, hey, hold on, captain. Those is an engine on this boat,

586
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:56,178
right? So why should we roll manually? If we can just

587
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:59,714
start the engine and get some rest, right?

588
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:02,802
So perhaps the captain would then say,

589
00:37:02,856 --> 00:37:06,790
okay, we are in some kind of special

590
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,914
ecologic zone. There are different type of animals. We need to keep silent.

591
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:14,546
We cannot use engine area like masurian

592
00:37:14,578 --> 00:37:18,566
lakes in Poland, for instance. You have to use those if

593
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:21,170
there is no wind on your boat.

594
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,574
And, well, it makes sense. From Milan,

595
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:28,138
they know the reason why we should do this, in order not to disturb some

596
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:32,618
wild animals. All right, then we can roll in silence.

597
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:36,640
Okay, and what about Generation Z? So basically,

598
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,878
let's say the captain says we are rowing. And what would those

599
00:37:40,964 --> 00:37:44,498
Gen Z member say? Hey, what are we

600
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:47,170
proving towards the right island?

601
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:51,342
Is the island called profit the right target?

602
00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:55,262
Maybe we should also visit some other islands, like environment

603
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:59,222
or local communities or some other just

604
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:02,600
causes. And this is something that would

605
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:08,502
make Generation Z more happy, not just earning

606
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:12,170
money for the company. All right, so those is our trip

607
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,926
in a boat. So in the end, I was telling

608
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:19,558
you about different stuff that different generations,

609
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:23,402
let's say, put emphasis on, right? Some of them likes this,

610
00:38:23,456 --> 00:38:26,560
some of them like that. But in the end, if you look at this,

611
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,686
basically all of us need some kind of stability in the company.

612
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:33,710
We want to have some leader that knows the direction.

613
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,114
We like to be a little bit independent. We like to see the result of

614
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:42,002
our work. We don't want to spend the whole life at

615
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:45,634
job. We want to have some private life. We enjoy some kinds of. A little

616
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:48,802
bit of flexibility. We are a little bit individualistic.

617
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:52,406
It's nice to have good atmosphere in the job, to get

618
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:55,494
some feedback, to have this feeling that we are

619
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:59,050
doing some greater good, not just earning money and

620
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,346
of course getting respect from others. So basically all of

621
00:39:02,368 --> 00:39:06,342
those things is important for all of the members of different generation,

622
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:09,302
maybe with a little bit of different emphasis.

623
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:13,086
So we can look at this tale about generation, but this

624
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:16,686
is basically like a story of evolution of

625
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:20,014
our. Those slide was

626
00:39:20,052 --> 00:39:25,406
blurred on purpose. Don't worry. It's from the book reinventing

627
00:39:25,438 --> 00:39:29,246
organizations by Frederick Lalou, who is describing,

628
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:33,154
let's say, different types of organizations, how they evolve over

629
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:37,046
time. And most of those types evolved over not

630
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:40,466
that many, like last hundred years. Many organizations

631
00:39:40,498 --> 00:39:44,306
are at different levels, and we can see that those organizations

632
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:47,490
put different emphasis on different stuff.

633
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,166
And those different generations

634
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:56,170
kind of invented some parts of our workplace for us.

635
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,500
And currently you can take advantage of all of that.

636
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,902
All right, so we are nearing to an end, so called those last

637
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:07,406
slide. So this QR code

638
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:11,310
actually leads to my LinkedIn profile. You're very welcome to

that. If you want to add some notes from

642

this lecture or you would like to look at the

643
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:28,694
slides again or some recording from different instances of this

644
00:40:28,732 --> 00:40:32,406
talk, I have it all on my blog, which is called how to train your

645
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:35,586
Java. It's not about Java anymore, don't worry.

646
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:40,018
It's mostly about general software and people work. If you'd

647
00:40:40,034 --> 00:40:43,302
like to reach me in private, ask some questions, you are very
