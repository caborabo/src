00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,322
this house. Understood. Technological advancement the demands placed upon and

8
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:52,430
networks are growing exponentially. The traditional

9
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:55,782
manual methods of network management are no longer sufficient to

10
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:59,326
cope with the complexity and the scale of modern networks. This is

11
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,470
where AI starts offering a transformative solution in the process to reshape

12
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:07,342
the landscape. Automatic management. When combined with the immense competition of

13
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,486
power of particle computing, the possibilities become even more

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,214
extraordinary. Now, I handed over to Sadha

15
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:18,074
to walk you through the impact of AI in the field of digital backfire.

16
00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:22,502
Hello everyone. One of the most significant ways the IP is

17
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:25,354
impacting their drug management is through predictive maintenance.

18
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:30,126
By leveraging their algorithms, network can now predict potential disruptions

19
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,634
with remarkable accuracy, often up to 90%.

20
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:37,006
This proactive approach allows us to address issues

21
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,902
way before they escalated back users,

22
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:42,714
ensuring a seamless and reliable network experience.

23
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:46,912
Imagine a world where network operators are a them of the basic

24
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:50,956
AI is making this a reality. Quantum computing can further

25
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,988
enhance this predictive capability by rapidly analyzing vast

26
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:58,676
datasets and identifying the patterns that might be invisible to traditional

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,116
computers. AI powered systems are not

28
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,620
just about predicting the problems, they are also about

29
00:02:05,732 --> 00:02:08,544
optimizing the network performance in real time.

30
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:12,376
These intelligent systems can dynamically adjust to

31
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,440
rainy traffic loads, much like self driven cars adapt to changing

32
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:19,840
go conditions. This self optimizing capability

33
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,920
results in efficiency improvements of over 30% compared

34
00:02:23,952 --> 00:02:27,792
to traditional methods, ensuring that our networks are always

35
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,560
operating at their peak. Quantum computing can take

36
00:02:31,592 --> 00:02:34,800
this optimization to the next level by exploring

37
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:38,372
vast solution space and finding optimal configurations

38
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:42,236
that were previously unattainable. The complexity

39
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,572
of network management has long been a challenge for organizations

40
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,204
AI simplifying this complexity by automating many of the routine

41
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:52,904
tasks that previously required significant human intervention.

42
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:57,972
This not only reduces operational cost by approximately 25%,

43
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:02,060
but also frees up valuable human resources to focus on strategic

44
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:06,346
initiatives that can drive innovation and growth. Quantum computing

45
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,618
can further streamline these processes by solving complex

46
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:13,354
optimization problems in a fraction of time. It could take

47
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:17,082
traditional computers the impact of AI clinical network

48
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:20,786
management is not just a point to theoretical run, it's already

49
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,734
making a tangible difference in various industries,

50
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:29,002
from personalized recommendations in streaming services

51
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:32,274
to adaptive mechanisms in server cars

52
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:35,294
and predictive maintenance in industrial settings.

against the threat of quantum computers breaking current encryption

110
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:17,576
standards. By building quantum enhanced security measures,

111
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,816
organizations can ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability

112
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,176
of the network resources. While the potential of quantum

113
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,328
computing in network management is immense, there are also challenges

114
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:31,720
to overcome. Quantum computers are

115
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:35,080
still in their early stages of development, and there are technical hurdles

116
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:38,864
to overcome before they can be widely adopted. Additionally, there is a need for

117
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:42,120
skilled quantum workforce and the development of quantum specific software

118
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:46,076
in tools. However, the opportunity is far outweigh the

119
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,532
challenges. By investing quantum research and development,

120
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:53,628
organizations can position themselves at the forefront of this technological revolution

121
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:56,104
and reap the rewards of quantum advantage.

122
00:07:56,724 --> 00:08:00,524
In conclusion, the convergence of Bi and quantum computing

123
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:03,144
is set to redefine the landscape of network management,
