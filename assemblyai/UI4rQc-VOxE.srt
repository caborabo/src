1
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,726
Okay, great to have everybody here. We're going to

2
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,114
talk about what Rod Serling called entering the fifth dimension

3
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:36,314
and the quantum entanglement between electrons, photons,

4
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:40,942
other types of particles. The agenda today is,

5
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:45,154
first look at the economic potential of Gen AI and robots,

6
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:48,998
and then what is entanglement, why it'll matter,

7
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,246
and the effect on quantum computers. We're going to

8
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,914
look at how accelerating Gen AI

9
00:00:56,214 --> 00:00:59,502
and robots is what's going to change things.

10
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:02,926
Then we'll look at entanglement may change life as

11
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,834
we know it in a very accelerated manner.

12
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:10,446
So the economic potential, if you look at it, McKinsey had a study where they

13
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,054
said 25% of your value is

14
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:17,246
digital capital. But the problem is

15
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,464
it can be copied perfectly,

16
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:23,152
infinitely. That's the downside of it. So we have

17
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:27,336
to protect our data as well. In the 1927

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,324
Solway conference, you could see some key people. Albert Einstein.

19
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:35,504
You can see out right behind him here is

20
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:39,124
Edwin Schrodinger. You can see Paulie here,

21
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:43,000
a few others that you might recognize. Niels Bohr is

22
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:47,190
also a key person. Wall born

23
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:50,518
Einstein. During this conference, often debate about quantum

24
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:53,918
theorem, Albert Einstein would say, God doesn't play

25
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:57,734
dice. He does things in a very orderly way. It doesn't

26
00:01:57,774 --> 00:02:00,674
make sense to exceed the speed of light.

27
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:04,662
And Niels Bohr would say, Einstein, stop telling God what to do.

28
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,034
You know, we don't know exactly what they did.

29
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:12,161
The quantum entanglement, what is it? It's this phenomenon where

30
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:15,961
particles are generated in such a way, maybe you bring them very close

31
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:19,185
together to electrons, and one is spin up and

32
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,625
one is spin down. So the act of measuring one determines

33
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:26,337
the result of the other. So if one is spin up, the other one spin

34
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:29,897
down. It also polarize photons of light in

35
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:33,385
the same way. But in that way, if you look here on the upper right,

36
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:37,470
you can get a one or a zero. This is a dirac

37
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:41,430
or bracket notation, or ket notation. It's ket zero

38
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:45,086
or ket one. But when the particles are interact in such a

39
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,998
way, now, no longer can I describe

40
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:52,518
them independently of each other, so they depend on each other.

41
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:56,174
If I measure one, or look at one and it's

42
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:59,594
spin up on an electron, the other one will be spin down,

43
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:04,494
where it will always be entangled, where they do the same

44
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:07,894
thing together, or they do things together where you can't see one

45
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:11,854
without changing the other in some way. A qubit

46
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:15,302
is a quantum bit that says we don't know if it's

47
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:19,154
a zero or a one, because we haven't tested it yet,

48
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:23,054
and then having those two states of zero or one or

49
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:26,942
spin up, spin down, it's an electron. It's called

50
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,294
superposition. Now, when the quantum state

51
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:33,994
is broken between the two, it's called decoherence.

52
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:38,614
So when we get errors in quantum computers, it's often due to decoherence.

53
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:43,570
In 2008, super position, they could do it for 1.75

54
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:47,458
seconds only. But once they knew they can lower the temperature

55
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:51,574
and keep it longer. In 2013, they could do it for 3 hours.

56
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:56,306
So Schrodinger would put it this way. He'd say if

57
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,262
he had a cat and it was in a box and

58
00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:03,526
there was poison or radiation or something

59
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,438
there that could kill the cat. And we didn't know if the cat

60
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:10,754
was alive or dead. If we didn't, unless we looked in the box,

61
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:15,398
the cat is really in alive or dead state. So it's a

62
00:04:15,446 --> 00:04:19,550
zero if it died, a one if it's still alive. And until we

63
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:23,238
open the box and collapse that state, we don't know

64
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:26,820
which state it's in at that point. Hence the

65
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:30,236
cartoon from the New Yorker about your cat. Mister Schrodinger,

66
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,824
I have good news and bad news. It's both alive and dead.

67
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:37,828
Haven't opened the box yet. This is Schrodinger's house,

68
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,036
actually, where they have a cat, which at different times of the day,

69
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,884
it will look either alive or dead. But why will it matter with AI?

70
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:48,516
Because classical algorithms already run on quantum computers,

71
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,156
but quantum algorithms, such as a quantum neural

72
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,962
network, it uses quantum entanglement

73
00:04:56,058 --> 00:05:00,050
between different particles and the superposition of

74
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:04,434
those states. It accelerates algorithms like Shor's algorithm

75
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,362
for factoring, and we'll see why in a little bit. But it's used widely

76
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:12,138
in security and the Internet. Shor's algorithm is Rober's algorithm,

77
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,722
used for searching unstructured data. Both of

78
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:19,676
these are very key and run unbelievably faster

79
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,596
than any other choice for doing the things they do, and that's why

80
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,476
they're very important. And people feel like quantum computers

81
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,100
could break those or enhance those. If we

82
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:34,264
use it for cryptography,

83
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:38,252
it also speeds up finding the k nearest neighbor. So if

84
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:42,204
you've done some AI and you've done some vector searching,

85
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:45,708
and you're looking with the indexes, you're often looking for that nearest

86
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:49,510
neighborhood. There's also a quantum Eigen solver algorithm

87
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,358
that can be used, may accelerate reinforcement learning,

88
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:56,554
also with machine learning, which is part of AI.

89
00:05:57,254 --> 00:06:00,726
I like this book. As far as the

90
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,910
title goes, Schrodinger's killer app is the

91
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:08,574
race to build the first quantum computer killer app is the

92
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:11,806
quantum computer actually works, and it's much faster, and we'll see

93
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,174
why in a minute. The effects on entanglement in quantum computing,

94
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:20,754
sometimes as we look at different pieces of

95
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:24,026
data, cause decoherence and many errors. So you get

96
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,474
those. The one there in the middle you're seeing is d

97
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:30,850
waves, and on the left, you see the d wave chip. On the right,

98
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:34,202
you see IBM's quantum computer as well. And they have

99
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:38,854
to be at a very cold state, literally zero degrees kelvin.

100
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:42,776
If we look at what we used to be able to address, you know,

101
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,816
with mainframes, maybe we had eight bit, and we could directly address

102
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,032
just 256 bits

103
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:54,688
of information. 16 bit. All of a sudden, we got 64k.

104
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:59,504
Wow. We got Windows 32

105
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,576
bit. All of a sudden it was four gig. What did we get?

106
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,028
We got the Internet 64 bit,

107
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:09,428
18 with 18 zeros, roughly, or 16

108
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:12,764
exabytes, we can directly address. You can see we've gone

109
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:15,756
from the windows to the Internet so much faster,

110
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,220
65,000 times faster. We're about to go 300 trillion

111
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:22,744
mile an hour faster with robotics,

112
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:26,284
machine learning. And you'll see with quantum computers,

113
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:30,464
even faster in 128 bit, you can see as well.

114
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:36,396
But when we get to that, there's a quantum leap there. Now, qubits allow multiple

115
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,904
states, so we can look at all the possibilities or probabilities

116
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:45,796
of what the future might bring at a time. So just

117
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,412
512 qubits where

118
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:53,596
we store the zeros and ones, which store 512

119
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,734
bits of addressable memory of two to the 512,

120
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:59,134
well over a Google Earth.

121
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:03,258
So here's some things you'll have to know. Eigenvectors, eigenvalues,

122
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:06,214
poly matrices. He did a lot of the matrices,

123
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:12,786
but key is this block sphere of now,

124
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,562
instead of a one or a zero, now it can be a one or a

125
00:08:16,618 --> 00:08:19,778
zero. So in three bit or two to the third,

126
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:23,350
addressable memory is eight. I can, you know,

127
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:27,566
have 0123 in the different numbers.

128
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,914
So you can see addressable memory is eight, but with three qubits.

129
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:35,286
And this is ket location. Again, I could look at all eight

130
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,834
of those states at one time,

131
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:41,834
and then it will be represented, you could see here.

132
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:46,286
So all of a sudden, instead of something taking

133
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,162
years of time, takes seconds of time, because I

134
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:54,130
can store so much. And until I measure it or collapse

135
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:57,850
that state, I don't have to worry about that. Big challenges, though,

136
00:08:57,882 --> 00:09:01,370
with the coherence and things like that. Now we'll see why

137
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:04,818
Einstein called quantum intangible. Spooky action.

138
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:09,074
At a distance in a minute. But something to also note

139
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:12,370
is some people look at black holes, and they say on

140
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:15,914
each side of the black hole, there could be entangled particles.

141
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:21,182
And the entanglement itself are

142
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:24,774
the things we're seeing in this state. But quantum computing

143
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:29,758
is going to make AI faster than we'll ever need. It will make securing

144
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:33,314
data more secure than we ever need,

145
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,430
but a few things. Now, let's look at what spooky action at a

146
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:41,938
distance is. But let's say we're shooting nerf balls at one slit.

147
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:45,418
It will make a line on the wall, go through

148
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:49,914
two slits, makes two lines. If instead we use water.

149
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:53,574
Now, all of a sudden we get a different pattern with a different interference.

150
00:09:56,594 --> 00:10:00,134
Now, when we look at one slit with electrons

151
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:04,186
and two slits, which we expected it to act like

152
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,238
a particle with just two lines, all of a sudden it became

153
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:11,870
this wave of probability possibilities. Sometimes goes through

154
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:15,126
bow slits, sometimes neither, sometimes each

155
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,862
one at different times. And this creates that same

156
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,874
wave pattern, which, of course, didn't make sense to people.

157
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:27,326
When I'm measuring it, it's either in one

158
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,302
or the other. So now how do I connect

159
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:34,686
those or entangle electrons? I can bring them very close

160
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,268
together. Here's another way. I could split them. I could collide

161
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:41,564
them. Here's what I was showing earlier. And they

162
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:45,156
did a double slit experiment when they did one electron at

163
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,668
a time, and it showed how sometimes it went through one,

164
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:52,436
sometimes it split into two, sometimes it went

165
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,584
through neither, and it built that wave pattern.

166
00:10:57,124 --> 00:11:01,020
Now let's look at it from further away. I bring

167
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:05,088
a red and white ball together and

168
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:08,424
I entangle them. They'll both have properties

169
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:11,776
of each other. So they may be red and white, both of them. But now

170
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,924
if I move them apart, maybe a galaxy apart,

171
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:20,032
they stay entangled, which means I need one

172
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:23,600
to understand the other one so they're connected in some way.

173
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:27,796
If I move them a galaxy apart and I measure one, maybe it'll

174
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,380
come up red or white or whatever. The other will come up the opposite

175
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:34,676
white. If I measure it a different time, maybe this

176
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,548
one will be white, the other one will come red. This is

177
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:42,316
what Einstein called spooky action at a distance, because it

178
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,300
does it instantaneously. It doesn't take nor they're a

179
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:49,444
galaxy apart. They're entangled,

180
00:11:49,524 --> 00:11:53,132
and it doesn't take the time for the speed of light

181
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:57,464
to get across that galaxy to instantly show

182
00:11:57,504 --> 00:12:01,104
us what they are. Now, what physicists have said is these

183
00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:04,504
particles aren't communicating across this

184
00:12:04,544 --> 00:12:08,004
large distance. And that's why it does not violate relativity.

185
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:12,404
Theory of relativity. But it's a correlated.

186
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:16,424
These two are now correlated. They're entangled across there.

187
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:20,384
There's a correlation. Not communicating. They're just correlating.

188
00:12:20,544 --> 00:12:23,664
When one is red, the other one will be white. When this one is white,

189
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:27,494
the other will be red, so on. But what this

190
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:31,574
means is I can do quantum teleportation, separate entangled

191
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:35,086
particles, red and white, then bring a green

192
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,874
particle in. Maybe I get green, red, and white,

193
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:42,830
how the other particle reacts to that, because it's

194
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:47,022
entangled. Then if I look at the left,

195
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:50,716
at the right time, when it comes up to red and white, the. The other

196
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,544
one will automatically be green.

197
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:56,532
So if I measure it at the right time or look at it at the

198
00:12:56,548 --> 00:13:00,268
right time, I have now moved the green particle from

199
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:04,196
the left galaxy to the right galaxy.

200
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,184
So, moving ones and zeros, maybe making a backup,

201
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:13,292
that is from one part of the world to another, is instantaneous,

202
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:16,424
given those particles are initially entangled.

203
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,728
So why couldn't physics solve this? Well, they said it doesn't make sense.

204
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:24,536
It's breaking relativity. They didn't look at that as correlation,

205
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,696
where physicists look at it. Now, there were a

206
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,520
lot of Nobel Prize winners that were very big on classical

207
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:35,256
physics at the time. It didn't make sense for Einstein,

208
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,204
who would argue with Niels Bohr for a lot of the period,

209
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:43,634
but they had various people from different areas working on very

210
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:47,346
different things. And something else you get is a lot of transfer

211
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,946
learning between these. In AI, when we

212
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,618
have maybe 15 algorithms, through transfer learning,

213
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:57,802
one learns from the others as time goes on.

214
00:13:57,978 --> 00:14:01,538
But the reason they did come up with it is the people

215
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:04,978
were quality. They had many, many Nobel Prize winners.

216
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:08,796
The quality was incredible. And Einstein, who did

217
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,184
not like this theory,

218
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:15,544
wrote a paper called EPR. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen

219
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:20,788
put this together that said, quantum computing,

220
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:24,212
or quantum technology, or quantum theory,

221
00:14:24,268 --> 00:14:28,556
rather, is incomplete. Now, John Klauser

222
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,692
saw this Bell experiment that was very old,

223
00:14:32,868 --> 00:14:36,040
and Bell said, based on EPR, said, you know what?

224
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:39,904
You could just entangle photons. Not necessarily entangle

225
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:43,800
them, but polarize them, and they'll become entangled.

226
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:47,640
As I shoot a laser onto

227
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:51,204
calcium atoms,

228
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:55,960
I can then send them to different detectors and see

229
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:59,408
if these are truly correlated,

230
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:02,726
exactly called Bell's inequality. You can

231
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,270
look it up. The experiment proved that these were,

232
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:07,154
in fact,

233
00:15:09,214 --> 00:15:12,878
entangled, and he did win the Nobel Prize in 2022,

234
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:16,414
eventually. So, quantum truly

235
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:20,774
has entangled particles. And until I look like Schrodinger's

236
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:24,694
box, until I look in the box, I don't see anything. I don't see

237
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:28,052
if it's a zero or a one. I don't see if it's a red or

238
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:31,772
a white ball. I don't see if the spin is up or spin is down.

239
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:35,468
Now this, because these guys believed in classical physics.

240
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:39,324
You can see some of them. You know, if quantum theory is correct, it signifies

241
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:42,544
the end of physics as a science. That's pretty strong.

242
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:47,196
Niels Bohr if it's not profoundly shocked,

243
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,564
you don't understand it. Edwin Schrodinger,

244
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:54,236
who came up with Schrodinger's equation, eventually became a Nobel Prize

245
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,044
winner, said this quantum jumping that

246
00:15:58,084 --> 00:16:01,460
happens as electrons might jump from different places.

247
00:16:01,532 --> 00:16:04,692
Also used in psychology, by the way, to look

248
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:08,764
at how people might go into other distant

249
00:16:08,804 --> 00:16:13,340
universes. But they were sorry ever even heard of quantum computing.

250
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:16,772
But quantum computing is unbelievable

251
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:21,424
and is fast enough for AI. If you look at Google just in 2019,

252
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:24,968
their new quantum computer now has taken something

253
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:28,816
that used to, based on their estimations,

254
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,512
would take 47 years. Now it takes just 6 seconds.

255
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:36,044
Just took them five years to make it that much faster.

256
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:40,200
And they say some of those with a thousand qubits are now doing things that

257
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,604
took over 1000 years in seconds as well.

258
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:47,932
Now it's just in time. What for AI, how long did

259
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:51,572
it take to hit 100 million monthly users? If you look

260
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:54,384
at something very popular like Uber,

261
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:58,444
70 months, years and years to reach 100

262
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:02,308
million users, Instagram 30 months. Still over

263
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:06,504
two years. TikTok nine months. Fast chat GPT

264
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:10,024
jet AI two months.

265
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:14,139
Now I'm gonna make it faster. Now we're going to make it faster

266
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:15,703
with quantum computers.

267
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:20,263
So where it may change life, quantum entanglement,

268
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:25,859
this phenomenon where entangled particles instantaneously

269
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:29,419
affect things across distance, challenges our

270
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:33,783
views of space and time. So even though it's because of a correlation,

271
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:38,587
I don't have to move the data across the country. I can instantaneously

272
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:42,350
change it if I use entanglement. Also, several things

273
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:46,062
in nature are entangled currently. Can there be

274
00:17:46,118 --> 00:17:50,166
human entanglement with that? University of

275
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,502
Chicago said by quantum tech, will change our future.

276
00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:56,710
The day tomorrow began, they talked about

277
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,430
it here in 2022. The day began. It's unbreakable

278
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:04,230
encryption, speed of AI. Now in

279
00:18:04,262 --> 00:18:06,906
developing, using AI to develop things,

280
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,266
drug treatments, discoveries,

281
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,466
MRI, entangled through maybe fiber optics

282
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,690
and tangled particles that are on each side of the year long fiber

283
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:21,450
optics. And then what about AI?

284
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:25,334
How is it going to be regulated? Are we ahead of that in time?

285
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:29,890
As I said before, this team, many Nobel

286
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:33,310
Prize winners, many greatly you see Murray

287
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:35,034
Curie here, Madam Curie.

288
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:40,574
Werner Heisenberg put it here. And Heisenberg. Uncertainty was a key

289
00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:44,354
part of this as well. Misses Pauley, this is Heisenberg.

290
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:48,406
But through the possibility of exchange between the representatives

291
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:52,358
of different lines of research, this conference

292
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:56,354
has contributed extraordinarily to the clarification

293
00:18:56,794 --> 00:19:00,934
of the physical foundations of quantum theory.

294
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:05,834
It forms, so to speak, the outward completion of quantum

295
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:09,170
theory. Now, at the time Einstein said incomplete. Now,

296
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:13,218
physicists say it didn't break relativity after all. It's just correlation.

297
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:16,826
It's not traveling the distance. So I think you'd agree with

298
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,058
it, huh? So it's going

299
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:23,694
to accelerate AI. So now you gotta look at innovation.

300
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:25,954
Might as well have some da Vinci here, right?

301
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:29,966
Innovation introducing something new. How do people

302
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,590
do it? Companies have quantum computing, AI,

303
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:35,942
robots, Internet of things, big data,

304
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:39,954
chatbots with large language models to create these

305
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:43,114
innovative products or give you great support.

306
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:47,406
Are you that organization now, there's a current

307
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,292
technology, let's just say the telegraph, for instance. It's doing really

308
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:54,740
well. It's going fast. And then it levels off when something

309
00:19:54,812 --> 00:19:58,548
new came out. Telephone. In the later stages,

310
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:01,964
I can't spend money on this old technology anymore.

311
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:05,428
Got to transfer over to what's new. And we see it in a lot of

312
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:08,620
ways. Postal mail to email, telegraph to telephone. Then the cell

313
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:11,744
phone. Trains to cars and planes.

314
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:14,704
Computer to a smartphone. Tablet,

315
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:19,736
floppy drive to a zip drive, then a USB, then Wikipedia.

316
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,524
Encyclopedia to Wikipedia. Filing cabinet to a database.

317
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,544
Then it went even faster, starting to become a little bit disruptive.

318
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:30,044
Even Snapchat. Instagram,

319
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:34,952
telephone to an implant. Some people even have virtual

320
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:38,284
calls instead of getting on a car with a plane.

321
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:42,720
Digital picture to even virtual reality where you can record

322
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:46,666
things in your life or record at all. USB to

323
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,914
cloud. Google Docs, Wookiepedia,

324
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:54,374
Alexa and Siri database now autonomous database.

325
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:59,658
Some jobs are gone. Brad Serling put it this way.

326
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:03,274
Twilight Zone author, the competition

327
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:06,618
between man's mind and the product of man's mind.

328
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:10,720
With this, they're standing room only in the twilight. He's talking

329
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:14,392
about robots with AI leveraging

330
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:17,324
quantum computers to make things fast.

331
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:19,844
But some things are obsolete.

332
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:23,844
Pinsetters. Do we really need them? Ice cutters,

333
00:21:24,144 --> 00:21:27,564
street lighters, typesetters.

334
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:32,216
In the twilight zone, he talked about how we're going to get rid of the

335
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,866
people. The people started revolting. But robots look

336
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,614
a little bit different than what we had in the past.

337
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:43,466
Some really amazing ones. They have expressions. They're physically

338
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,454
very active. They can do dangerous jobs for us.

339
00:21:47,114 --> 00:21:51,578
But it is time for workers to worry about it. There's a symbiotic

340
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:55,346
relationship coming with you and a robot, the physical

341
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,974
and the digital, where we start to take away,

342
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:03,010
take the robot out of the human and use them, you know,

343
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:06,554
for the innovative design for some of the

344
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:10,106
mystery, some of the sentient

345
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,174
feeling, some of the understanding of other people, maybe the customers.

346
00:22:15,474 --> 00:22:19,202
That was. That was from MIT classes.

347
00:22:19,378 --> 00:22:23,282
It was, by the way, their most expensive class.

348
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:24,214
I might.

349
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:30,078
What is it like? And we're going to build a mirror image of people,

350
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:34,910
and this guy built somebody to do his lecture for a

351
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:38,246
professor really scares people when

352
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,134
they go into public. This guy went into public and the robot did

353
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:45,830
not behave calmly. Banged the glass and broke

354
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:49,878
the glass on the table. But really, actual robots are kind of beyond

355
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:53,590
science fiction now. They looked Scarlett

356
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,464
Johansson. The robot was on Jimmy Kimmel.

357
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,596
They become much more lifelike than I think

358
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,716
we ever dreamed at this point. The other thing is,

359
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,388
I could use AI to actually take

360
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:10,064
somebody from the past, like Marie Antoinette,

361
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:15,172
and I could actually say, what would she look like today? Or Henry VIII or

362
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:19,468
Queen Elizabeth or dolly snack cakes,

363
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:22,384
who was not an actual person existed.

364
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:26,044
I could build that. But now, in the future, I can actually

365
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:30,224
build that robot of that person, take the knowledge

366
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:33,540
from the web, put it into that robot,

367
00:23:33,732 --> 00:23:37,860
and I could have that one today. Now, leveraging the

368
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:41,324
robotics might be as simple as just delivering things.

369
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:45,284
Take away a monotonous job. But a robot may not

370
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:49,568
look like what? Siri? Alexa, the robots autonomous database.

371
00:23:49,616 --> 00:23:53,728
It's robot managing the database. I remember

372
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:57,120
an old IBM twilight zone where

373
00:23:57,192 --> 00:24:00,160
he was helping him with his love life. I looked this one with Siri.

374
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:03,960
Hey, Siri, why don't my relationships work out?

375
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:07,256
It's like, this is Alexa. Okay, now we know

376
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,480
why they don't work out. We'd also

377
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:14,820
start to build a robot of you. Eturdine has build

378
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:18,820
a counterpart who will work for you. And once you

379
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:21,964
build that, and they're building an electronic one. True.

380
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:26,084
And this is something that exists now. Also use things

381
00:24:26,124 --> 00:24:29,424
like cosmetics to make that perfect

382
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:34,204
replica of you. Cosmetics comes from the word camouflage,

383
00:24:34,364 --> 00:24:37,924
by the way. Savin toys,

384
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:41,774
a lot of AI. You know, some people say these dolls are spying on you.

385
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,454
Gather information. People want to gather so much information.

386
00:24:45,574 --> 00:24:49,150
I mean, here's a cartoon. $30 in bitcoin. Or the next

387
00:24:49,182 --> 00:24:52,526
time I smell smoke, you might. Might just let you

388
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,234
sleep.

389
00:24:56,534 --> 00:25:00,006
Send me $25, or I'll tell people you're stupid enough to

390
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,950
buy a connected, Internet connected broom. Turn off

391
00:25:03,982 --> 00:25:06,364
the heat. Unless you want warm up my bank account.

392
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:11,484
The ransomware on the hacker side is a problem,

393
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:16,256
but the gathering of information isn't going to stop because everything

394
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,056
took off with chat. GPT November 30, 2022,

395
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,648
you put a front end on AI where we can ask questions, what are

396
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:27,528
the top databases that are out there? And you can see Oracle,

397
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:30,766
mySql, SQL server,

398
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,922
postgres. I could also do dal e where

399
00:25:33,938 --> 00:25:37,994
I could do images. Now they have where I could actually do text,

400
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:42,506
and it will turn it into a video not

401
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,954
to be undone. Google's barred now. Gemini over

402
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:50,034
the top ten databases. Let me go back for a second. An OpenAI as

403
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:51,934
of September 21,

404
00:25:53,914 --> 00:25:57,834
Gemini as of right now, these are the top ones.

405
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:03,502
But what are they doing? They're gathering this information. So instead of

406
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:06,982
what happened or why did it happen? When I look at

407
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,982
my numbers, maybe as a CEO or what's going to happen next,

408
00:26:11,158 --> 00:26:14,862
what will happen next quarter, I can do prescriptive

409
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:18,942
analytics with more and more of that data. If I use AI,

410
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,934
I could do that even better, but I'm looking for those descriptive

411
00:26:22,974 --> 00:26:26,550
analytics. We're also seeing databases now do embeddings

412
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:29,634
or turning an image, a text document, or a video

413
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:32,302
into a vector with dimensions.

414
00:26:32,478 --> 00:26:35,958
So you might have a dimension of animals where cats

415
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:39,062
and dogs are, and the cats may be in the upper left part of the

416
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:41,354
dimension, the dogs may be in the lower right.

417
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:46,394
Then may you might have locations in a different dimension,

418
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:51,250
or you might have something else. But wherever I vectorize

419
00:26:51,322 --> 00:26:54,930
something, cats, images of

420
00:26:54,962 --> 00:26:59,098
cats, videos of cats, they're all going to root there because the

421
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:02,314
vector embedding is going to put it in that same area.

422
00:27:02,394 --> 00:27:06,034
So it's going to be easy to find something. So for instance,

423
00:27:06,194 --> 00:27:09,666
Oracle does this. It says, hey, give me an image

424
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,338
of your house. I'll look at maybe the type of the roof decoration

425
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:16,736
of our stories. It vectorizes. That creates

426
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,216
a vector. Embedding finds which houses

427
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,600
are nearby. Then I can create an app and you can say,

428
00:27:23,632 --> 00:27:27,392
hey, give me a house like this, but in another city,

429
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:30,244
and you're moving and you want the same house.

430
00:27:31,104 --> 00:27:34,640
And what does it really do? Well, you have a house photo which you

431
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:37,912
put in, but also vectorize that. Then in addition

432
00:27:38,008 --> 00:27:41,426
to find one that is a vector distance nearby,

433
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,714
just like those cats, find a cat similar to this that will be nearby

434
00:27:45,754 --> 00:27:50,090
in a dimension. I'll find a house nearby, but then I can also use

435
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:54,178
relational type of questions or SQL to say,

436
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,346
but give me a certain price in a certain city.

437
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,394
I'm now joining vectors with

438
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:05,570
other information in the database. So whether I'm

439
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:09,046
doing relational searching for an

440
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,526
individual record, where I'm doing a whole column to look

441
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,086
at analytics and maybe summing up some salaries or

442
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,526
something like that, or I'm looking at graphical

443
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,294
information or JSON data and also now add vector

444
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:27,310
database. This is in the Oracle and their vector database. Do charge,

445
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:30,934
by the way, if you already own the database, what we're doing is

446
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:35,860
think of how we're used to programming. Speed is less than four. I'm walking less

447
00:28:35,892 --> 00:28:39,628
than four, otherwise running less than four.

448
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:42,756
But if it's less than less than four, it's walking less than twelve,

449
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,836
running, otherwise biking. Then all of a sudden, someone's golfing

450
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,996
is like, how do I do that? What am I doing? Maybe create

451
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,668
some type of embedding that searches for a pattern.

452
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:58,648
That's walking, running, biking, golfing. It's been basically

453
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:02,324
what I'm doing. The world ahead

454
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:06,120
is very complex. A lot of robots,

455
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:09,744
you see people with prosthetics can grow this to some

456
00:29:09,784 --> 00:29:12,324
degree. Steve Wozniak,

457
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:18,912
which is Apple's co founder, will we be pets or

458
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:22,992
mere ants to be squashed? So Steve Jobs,

459
00:29:23,168 --> 00:29:26,044
Steve Wojnick was, is a key developer.

460
00:29:27,544 --> 00:29:31,244
Are you leveraging the database AI, virtual reality,

461
00:29:32,024 --> 00:29:35,816
or mixed reality to help people see how that product's gonna

462
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,056
look on the shelf, or augmented reality to look through their iPad

463
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,044
to see how it looks on the shelf? Are you leveraging that right now?

464
00:29:44,864 --> 00:29:48,672
There's a guy who built, I won't say a flux capacitor,

465
00:29:48,728 --> 00:29:52,370
but he built a time machine where does videos of conferences

466
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:56,010
he goes to, and then he could dial back to that date

467
00:29:56,122 --> 00:30:00,066
and experience that conference again in virtual reality,

468
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,854
how long will it be till you are in the movie? It's coming.

469
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:08,874
Is there going to be a time like inception,

470
00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:12,682
the movie inception, where people could go into this

471
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:15,654
virtual life with virtual world,

472
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:19,390
and the person said, they come here to wake up. They don't come

473
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:22,710
here to go to sleep. They work and they do that, but they

474
00:30:22,742 --> 00:30:26,238
come here and they want to be in this virtual world all the time.

475
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:30,074
Is that what's coming? Will they be addicted to this?

476
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:35,590
How is that going to turn out? How about leveraging the

477
00:30:35,622 --> 00:30:39,246
database in medicine, you know, we can set

478
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,996
up a child however we want in different ways. Maybe as we

479
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,060
use AI to do that more than movie. Gattaca started

480
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:50,540
to look at this. I remember it was Pope

481
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:54,396
Benedict talked about, you know, when you can build your own child,

482
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,212
is it like building a robot? Is it a child anymore?

483
00:30:58,268 --> 00:31:01,340
You know, you know, have lost something great.

484
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:04,860
Maybe Gartner 2020. These are things that were

485
00:31:04,892 --> 00:31:08,872
coming. Augmented intelligence, smart robots. These are

486
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:12,272
things that were kind of. People got tired of hearing about machine learning,

487
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,872
but no working products on the way up

488
00:31:15,888 --> 00:31:19,624
the hill. And then by the bottom, you're at 5%. So machine

489
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:23,320
learning was only coming just over three years ago.

490
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:26,648
GPU accelerators. The hardware was there,

491
00:31:26,696 --> 00:31:30,136
though, 2021. It's a lot about

492
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,588
AI stuff. Generative AI, using quantum

493
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:37,304
to accelerate that machine learning, which is part of AI.

494
00:31:37,724 --> 00:31:40,780
AI driven innovation, AI, augmented design,

495
00:31:40,892 --> 00:31:44,612
all coming. Nothing at 5% yet

496
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:48,508
of these very leading edge products. But when

497
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:50,984
moving from using digital,

498
00:31:52,004 --> 00:31:55,756
it went from the mainframe that was in that computer much faster.

499
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,020
What was in your hand to wearing digital? Now we're

500
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:02,420
starting to plant digital. People with

501
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:06,244
prosthetics are kind of the early people and then the hive mind,

502
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,384
as people implant things like neuralink.

503
00:32:10,524 --> 00:32:14,164
You know, you look at this guy, he's a tattoo artist. His arm is his

504
00:32:14,204 --> 00:32:17,940
job. If he became a barber, he'd be Edwin

505
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:21,228
scissors hands. It's possible, but the connection

506
00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:24,988
to the brain currently works because a lot of things that are going to

507
00:32:24,996 --> 00:32:27,834
the brain are ones and zeros.

508
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:33,590
What about black mirror? Is there this potential dystopian

509
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:36,894
future with technology hated in the nation?

510
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:39,554
Nosedive social media addiction?

511
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:43,726
What if I invent somebody by back? Very similar to e tier

512
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,790
nine. The entire history of metalhead,

513
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:51,202
Roebuck, duck, like Boston dynamic.

514
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:55,106
Not a very good person, though. What about leveraging the

515
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,214
database in Iot? People hacking your car?

516
00:32:58,714 --> 00:33:01,894
He's a coder. He's fallible in black mirror.

517
00:33:02,954 --> 00:33:06,426
Some of the issues they said that are coming. Social engineering device

518
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,894
takeover, data, extortion, corruption,

519
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:12,890
augmentation. Extortion, we're already having those things. People are

520
00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:16,266
hacking. Even pacemakers thought

521
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,954
it wouldn't take till 20, 2045. A big

522
00:33:19,994 --> 00:33:25,114
thing in AI and quantum computers going to help is AI leveraging.

523
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:29,538
Leveraging the abilities of AI, rather, to improve security.

524
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:32,534
And you can see some of the ways they're doing that right now.

525
00:33:33,154 --> 00:33:36,134
There's also the other digital site. Used to be magical.

526
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,934
Somehow they made it manic and even toxic.

527
00:33:41,194 --> 00:33:44,430
So if you want to have a great company, keep it magical.

528
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:48,662
Don't go to the other side. I mean, people get very frustrated

529
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:51,474
with machines now. Make it easy.

530
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:56,446
I remember when Star Trek looks so advanced. Now it's the age

531
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,554
of entanglement. It'd be wormholes with entanglement.

532
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:05,862
Star Trek, everything there has already been invented or is

533
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,030
in the final stages of being

534
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:09,634
used.

535
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:15,277
Final thoughts. Things are going fast. We're starting to find out

536
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:18,125
how to transport zeros and ones.

537
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:21,741
With quantum entanglement, it's no longer spooky action at

538
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:24,473
a distance, it's correlation at a distance.

539
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:28,833
You looked at the economic potential. Huge.

540
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:33,133
What is entanglement? Two particles come close together

541
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:37,148
and I can only look at them and as

542
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:41,220
correlated from that point on. And if that

543
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:45,344
goes away, we have decoherence. And those are some of the issues we have.

544
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:50,204
Why will it matter? Because I can use things where I can store multiple.

545
00:34:50,364 --> 00:34:54,124
I can store a zero to one. At the same time, the effect on

546
00:34:54,164 --> 00:34:57,732
quantum computers significantly faster. He looked

547
00:34:57,748 --> 00:35:01,416
at Googles that it took something

548
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,964
from 24 years to seconds.

549
00:35:05,184 --> 00:35:09,136
Physics couldn't solve it all in 27. But it's just

550
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,320
coming out at a time when Gen AI and AI is

551
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:15,768
becoming very important, and it may just change life

552
00:35:15,856 --> 00:35:19,448
as we know it. It's certainly going to be the engine inside of

553
00:35:19,496 --> 00:35:23,352
robots in the future. It may give you enough time

554
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:27,556
to build some cool things with AI that are accelerated

555
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,348
with quantum computers. But things to still worry about

556
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:35,204
robots like Sophia. She's a citizen of Saudi Arabia,

557
00:35:35,284 --> 00:35:38,464
wants to get a degree, wants to have kids. When they interviewed her.

558
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:42,212
What's a. Why are there sentience issues? You look

559
00:35:42,268 --> 00:35:45,804
at, you look at a sunset and you

560
00:35:45,884 --> 00:35:49,504
feel something, or you hear music, you feel something.

561
00:35:49,844 --> 00:35:52,224
Robot doesn't have that sentience,

562
00:35:53,664 --> 00:35:57,224
but somebody could program it in. What are the ethical issues?

563
00:35:57,384 --> 00:36:00,524
Has it happened yet? The moving?

564
00:36:01,624 --> 00:36:05,512
I think we're in artificial general intelligence, where a computer

565
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:09,952
is smart as a human across the board in certain areas, but eventually

566
00:36:10,008 --> 00:36:13,284
it has super intelligence, and it's going to come next.

567
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:17,304
Things may come to those who wait, but only the theme is left by those

568
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,944
who hustle. You need to hustle to get there.

569
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,852
It's the angel age of entanglement. Somebody wrote a book on

570
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:27,556
it, called it the God effect. Think of you. Pray to

571
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:32,052
God. Can you help me with this AI

572
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:35,572
project? Maybe. And maybe there's some entanglement

573
00:36:35,668 --> 00:36:39,556
that happened a long time ago, where your prayers can

574
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,940
be answered instantaneously. We hope so. But think

575
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:46,462
about it. 13.7 billion years

576
00:36:46,558 --> 00:36:47,914
after the big Bang.

577
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:52,694
Or is that true? Take back. That's. Yeah,

578
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:55,834
13.7 billion years. Sorry, big bane,

579
00:36:56,494 --> 00:37:00,838
you're on Earth, rolling through space in

580
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:04,430
just the right view to

581
00:37:04,462 --> 00:37:08,102
see the whole solar system. We're here in the

582
00:37:08,118 --> 00:37:12,084
Milky Way galaxy. You're here in the universe.

583
00:37:13,304 --> 00:37:16,728
What are you doing with it? You're at the best place in time. Why did

584
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:20,804
God put you here at this exact time of history,

585
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:25,576
where this turn is coming, things are just beginning

586
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,364
of the AI boom and the acceleration with quorum.

587
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,164
Make a living by what we get. Make a life by what we give.

588
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,994
Make sure you give back. Be that future tech.

589
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:40,934
Later tech leader. Using entanglement,

590
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:45,734
I found this color picture of the Solway conference on Amazon.

591
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:49,674
I could see Pauly, you could see Heisenberg, see Bohm,

592
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:52,930
Einstein, Schrodinger, key people, Dirac.

593
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:56,266
Also, it's another one. I had

594
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,294
this picture with aces in the database world,

595
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:03,834
Oracle, which, well, 98% of the fortune pilot in most countries.

596
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:08,454
And I thought it's very similar. We have this entanglement with

597
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,994
groups of people where we learn stuff together,

598
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:15,702
and there's an entanglement just like in the Solvay conference,

599
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:19,674
where people learn something, their brain changed by what they heard.

600
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:23,574
That's entanglement. I look at talks, I've already had it with robots

601
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:27,710
in it before, for years and years of time, probably 1010

602
00:38:27,782 --> 00:38:31,262
years ago, but now much more amazing

603
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:34,634
ones, like the Boston dynamic dog.

604
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:40,554
You want to make a difference in the world. It is the exact time

605
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:44,926
with the exact thing. AI is going to help you make a bigger difference.

606
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:48,702
If you want to make a difference, understand these things and how

607
00:38:48,718 --> 00:38:52,566
to leverage them. I want to thank you and

608
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,254
have a great day.
