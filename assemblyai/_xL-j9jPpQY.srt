00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,418
Good morning. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining me today.

2
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:34,098
I am excited to discuss how AI and robotics are

3
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:37,954
revolutionizing product assembly, boosting material

4
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:41,498
recovery by 50%, reducing waste and

5
00:00:41,546 --> 00:00:45,506
advance sustainability. To start, lets consider the

6
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,322
complexity of modern product. Todays products are

7
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,514
incredibly integrated, featuring elaborate

8
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:56,038
designs and a variety of materials. For instance,

9
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:59,222
an average smartphone contains over 60

10
00:00:59,278 --> 00:01:02,126
different elements, including rare earth metals,

11
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,686
which are crucial for its functionality but challenging to

12
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,366
recycle. This complexity possesses significant

13
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,086
challenges for disembly, often leading to resource underutilization.

14
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,054
Valuable components are frequently discarded because they are difficult

15
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:22,294
to separate from other materials. This inefficiency results

16
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:26,210
in both economy losses and environmental degradation.

17
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:30,426
When valuable materials are wasted, companies lose potential revenue

18
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,098
and we all suffer from increased environmental

19
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:38,026
impact. Inefficient disembly means more waste

20
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,354
end up in landfill, contributing to pollution

21
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:44,534
and the depletion of natural resources.

22
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:48,970
Research indicates that up to 80% of

23
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:52,234
a product's environmental impact is determined

24
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:56,626
at the design stage. This static underscores

25
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,614
the critical need for efficient assembly methods.

26
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:05,882
If we can reclaim and recycle materials effectively,

27
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:09,774
we can mitigate a significant portion of this impact.

28
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:14,570
Efficient assembly is not just about reducing waste,

29
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:18,062
it's about making the most of the resources we have.

30
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:22,078
For example, think about an electric vehicle

31
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:25,398
battery. These batteries contain valuable

32
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:29,754
materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel.

33
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:33,654
Efficient assembly methods can reclaim these materials

34
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:37,382
for use, reducing the need for mining and

35
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:40,154
the associated environmental impacts.

36
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:44,236
Advanced AI and robotics play pivotal role

37
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,608
in achieving this efficiency. By integrating these

38
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:50,640
technologies into disembly processes,

39
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:54,232
we can navigate the complexities of

40
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:57,924
modern product designs with greater precision.

41
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:02,592
Imagine a world where every product can be taken apart

42
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:06,604
easily and every component can be used or recycled.

43
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:10,902
This vision is becoming a reality. With the help of AI

44
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:14,366
and robotics. Let's dive deeper into

45
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,590
how AI and robotics are transforming disassembly.

46
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,926
Advanced AI, particularly GPT based system,

47
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,734
combined with sophisticated vision and haptic sensors,

48
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:29,678
enable robots to disassemble products with

49
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:33,342
remarkable accuracy. These technologies allow

50
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:37,246
us to navigate the complexities of various product designs.

51
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,382
For instance, using machine learning algorithm, robots can be trained

52
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:45,238
to recognize different type of screws and fasteners

53
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:49,166
used in electronics, ensuring they can be removed without damaging the

54
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,078
components. Traditional disembly method often fail

55
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:56,782
to recover all components which are usable.

56
00:03:56,918 --> 00:04:00,174
However, industry they have that have adopted

57
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:04,062
AI in their disembly processors reports a 30%

58
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,734
of increase in the retrieval of the usable components.

59
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:12,154
This improvement has a direct impact on waste reduction

60
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:16,354
and material recycling. By recovering more usable components,

61
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:19,906
we reduce the amount of waste that end up in

62
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,354
landfills and increase the availability of materials

63
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:26,882
for use. AI powered robots in

64
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:30,314
an e waste recycling facility can sort and

65
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:34,446
separate valuable components like gold, silver, and palladium

66
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,734
from old circuit boards, which are then

67
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:41,590
sent for refining and reuse in new electronics.

68
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:45,594
This is a significant step toward a sustainable circular

69
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:50,294
the transformative impact of AI and robotics

70
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:54,350
on disembly processes cannot be

71
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:58,918
overstated. These technologies significantly reduce the environmental

72
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,994
footprint of product lifecycle management.

73
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:05,862
Companies that have implemented these technologies

74
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:09,502
report up to a 50% improvement in material

75
00:05:09,638 --> 00:05:13,150
recovery rates. This improvement

76
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:16,342
is just not aesthetics it represents real world

77
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:20,606
benefits. For example, by recovering more materials,

78
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,054
companies can reduce their reliance on raw material

79
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:27,652
extraction, which is often environmentally

80
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,964
damaging. This is particularly important in

81
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:36,304
industries like electronics, where raw material extraction involves

82
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:40,084
environmentally destruction practices like open pit

83
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:43,104
mining and the use of toxic chemicals.

84
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:47,276
Furthermore, improved medical recovery rates lead to more

85
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,148
efficient recycling processes. For instance,

86
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:54,508
AI system can analyze and optimize the sorting

87
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:57,844
of different plastic types, ensuring higher purity

88
00:05:57,884 --> 00:06:01,460
in recycled plastic materials. This efficiency

89
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:05,540
translates to practical benefit for a sustainable circular

90
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:09,076
economy. We can ensure that material continue

91
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,268
to circulate within the economy rather than being

92
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:16,916
lost as waste. Despite these

93
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,902
advancement, we still face several challenges in current

94
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:24,910
dissembling practices. One of the biggest challenges is the high rate

95
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:28,086
of resource wastage. Traditional methods of disassembly

96
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,862
in recycling are often inefficient,

97
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:34,110
leading to significant material losses.

98
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:37,974
For instance, many products are designed without considering how

99
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:42,358
they will be disassembled. This oversight makes it difficult

100
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:44,902
to separate materials effectively.

101
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:48,864
Additionally, traditional recycling method often involves

102
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:53,336
shredding materials, which can contaminate recyclable components

103
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,272
and reduce their quality. For example,

104
00:06:56,408 --> 00:06:59,560
shredding an old laptop can mix metals

105
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:03,240
and plastics and making it harder to recover pure

106
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:07,296
materials. AI and robotics present groundbreaking solution

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,640
to these issues. By automating the disembly process

108
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:14,738
and using AI to guide robots, we can overcome many

109
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:18,962
of the limitations of traditional methods. These technologies allow

110
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:22,454
for more precise and efficient disassembly,

111
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:26,066
reducing waste and improving material recovery. For example,

112
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,114
AI algorithm can optimize the disassembly sequence for

113
00:07:30,154 --> 00:07:33,774
complex products, ensuring minimal damage and

114
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,894
maximum recovery of valuable components.

115
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:42,718
To illustrate this practical application for these technologies,

116
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:47,022
let's look at some case studies. These examples demonstrate

117
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:50,574
how companies have successfully implemented AI and robotics in

118
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:53,750
their dissembling processes. In one case study,

119
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:57,822
a company used air driven robots to disable electronic

120
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,502
devices. The robots were able to identify

121
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:05,058
and separate valuable components with high precision,

122
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:09,694
leading to a 40% increase in material recovery.

123
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:13,986
The improvement not only reduced waste, but also provided

124
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,418
the company with additional revenue from the recovered

125
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:20,674
material. For instance, the recovered

126
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,450
metals were sold back to manufacturers and creating

127
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:28,498
a closed loop supply chain. In another example,

128
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:32,319
a manufacturing company implemented an AI guided

129
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:36,179
disembly system for automated parts. The system

130
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:40,275
significantly reduced the time cost associated with disembly

131
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,523
while also improving the quality of the recovered material.

132
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:48,507
This led to both economy and environmental benefits,

133
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:52,067
showcasing the potential of these technologies in promoting

134
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,983
sustainability. For example, the recovered parts are

135
00:08:56,363 --> 00:09:00,130
were refurbished and used in new vehicles,

136
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:03,794
reducing the need for new raw materials and lowering the

137
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,586
overall carbon footprint of the manufacturing

138
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,338
process. In conclusion, lets discuss

139
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:15,250
future insights into sustainable manufacturing

140
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:18,898
and recycling. AI enhanced disembly

141
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:22,714
is poised to become a cornerstone in achieving

142
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:26,254
sustainability as we look

143
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:30,350
to the future, its clear that balancing economic

144
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:34,454
development with ecological stewardship is

145
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:38,166
crucial. AI and robotics offer a viable solution to

146
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,694
this challenge. By continuing to innovate and integrate

147
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:46,078
these technologies, we can create a more sustainable future where

148
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:49,754
materials are used efficiently and wastes minimized.

149
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:53,970
Imagine a world where every product can be disassembled

150
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:57,826
and cycled efficiently, where waste is a thing of

151
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,578
the past and where economic growth goes hand in hand

152
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:04,874
with environmental responsibility is within

153
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:09,074
our reach. Thanks to the advancement in

154
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:12,554
AI and robotics, and thank you for your

155
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:16,178
attention. I hope you find this presentation insightful and

156
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:19,330
inspiring. I am happy to take any questions
