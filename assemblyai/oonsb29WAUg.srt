00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,906
Hi everyone. My name is Gong. I'm a product manager at Spotify

2
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,418
and today I'm really happy to be here to discuss product discovery and

3
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:39,654
in particular a data driven approach to product discovery.

4
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:44,010
So my talk will be divided into three main parts.

5
00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:47,362
Firstly, I will discuss, based on my experience,

6
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:50,294
how we can leverage data in product discovery.

7
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:54,658
Secondly, we will look into a few examples where companies like

8
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:58,626
Netflix or Spotify were able to leverage

9
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,362
the data that they collect in order to further strengthen their product mode.

10
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:06,306
And finally, we will also look into factors in

11
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,818
order for us to run data driven product discovery

12
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:13,458
effectively. So without further ado, let's jump

13
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:17,614
right in with the first part, how we can use data in product discovery.

14
00:01:18,154 --> 00:01:21,538
So product discovery is essentially a decision making

15
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:24,742
process, which means it requires

16
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:28,154
data as inputs in order for us to make informed decision.

17
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:32,286
I think all product teams will agree with me on the importance of

18
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,622
data in product management and more particularly in product

19
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:39,014
discovery. We all want to leverage data

20
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:43,514
as much as possible. So the question is how can we do that effectively?

21
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:47,502
So I could argue that one of the biggest challenges

22
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:51,214
for product teams when they look for answers to these questions

23
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:54,830
is the abundance of data. To the extent that we

24
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:58,590
are all overloaded with data in the digital world

25
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:01,718
nowadays. Take established large

26
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:05,550
scale products for example. We are probably looking at like

27
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:09,702
millions of data attributes and billions of data points being collected

28
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,374
every single day. So it can easily feel overwhelming for

29
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:17,054
product teams not knowing which data is relevant and

30
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:20,728
important in order for us to identify which problems

31
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:24,696
and subsequently which solutions to work on during the product discovery

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,364
process. So how can this be avoided?

33
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:31,352
To answer this question, lets take a step back and look into

34
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:35,016
the definition of the product discovery. So I

35
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,760
recognize that different organizations might have slightly different understanding

36
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:42,096
of product discovery. So to make it easier for us in

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,484
this talk, I could define product discovery as a process of identifying

38
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:50,460
key problems and their optimal solutions in order to achieve

39
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:54,756
the desired outcome. So it all starts with the desired outcomes

40
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,844
and we need to work from there in order to identify which data is

41
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:02,744
relevant and important for us during the product discovery process.

42
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:06,548
So lets discuss this further in the next slide.

43
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:10,516
So Im quoting Tyriasautorrus, the author of Continuous Discovery

44
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,030
Habit. Good discovery starts with a clear desired outcome.

45
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:19,270
So what I would like to add here is that even though it is important

46
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:23,270
to have clear desired outcomes, it is often just a

47
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:26,902
starting point for the product teams. And this is because

48
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:30,638
for product teams nowadays, more often than not, we are given

49
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:34,462
desired business outcomes, not desired product outcomes.

50
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:38,458
So whats the difference between these two? So again, im quoting Teresa

51
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:42,362
here, a business outcome is a metric that moves

52
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:46,074
the business forward, while the product outcomes helps us

53
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:49,654
understand if the product is moving the business forward.

54
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:53,554
Some examples of the business outcome include

55
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:57,146
to grow the user base, to grow the revenue, to grow the

56
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,934
profit, or to increase the retention.

57
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,814
So business outcomes are lacking indicators.

58
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:08,214
Once you are able to measure it, it is often too late

59
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:12,094
to do anything about it. And this is why it is

60
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:16,086
critical for product teams to be able to define desired

61
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,014
product outcomes based on the desired business outcomes

62
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:24,558
that they are given. For example, if the desired business

63
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:28,558
outcomes is to grow the revenue, some potential desired

64
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:32,276
product outcomes could be like existing customer will

65
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,996
buy more, or existing customer will be willing

66
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,780
to pay more for the same product, or new customers

67
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:43,716
from new countries will start buying products or new customers

68
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,064
from new segments will start buying products.

69
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:49,900
So defining desired product outcomes based on the

70
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:53,836
desired business outcomes is a major step toward effective

71
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,800
product discovery. And this is because product

72
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:01,608
outcomes are often leading indicators which enables

73
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:05,400
product team to learn about the impacts and reiterate

74
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:09,444
in quick cycle feedback. More importantly,

75
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:13,784
product outcomes are most within the influence of the product teams.

76
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:16,844
So once the desired product outcomes are defined,

77
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:20,656
product teams should also make sure to translate

78
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,396
those outcomes into appropriate product metrics.

79
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,704
And this is to ensure that we can measure the current situation

80
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:32,620
as well as validating any future impact of your

81
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:35,884
work. So one tip, I have to select

82
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:39,748
the right metrics to optimize for to select those

83
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:43,116
metrics based on the product life cycle. And this is

84
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,980
of course in addition to the desired business outcome that we were

85
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:50,668
given. So if your product is still in its early

86
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:54,282
phase, the focus is usually on

87
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:57,874
the retention. This is because you want to ensure that

88
00:05:57,914 --> 00:06:02,414
the users can perceive the value of your product before doing anything else.

89
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:06,602
Subsequently, the product metrics could be on the

90
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:09,730
churn rate, on the daily active user,

91
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,414
weekly active user ratio, or on the user engagement.

92
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,404
So once a job business has achieved their product market fit,

93
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:21,320
the focus of the business usually shifts towards scaling

94
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:24,976
the business. So for product teams, metrics like

95
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,088
sign ups, conversion or customer acquisition costs

96
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:33,176
become more relevant now. And this is because it

97
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,560
will provide valuable insights into how effective it

98
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:40,840
is in terms of your customer acquisition strategy and

99
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:44,408
how effective it is for you to convert them into engaged

100
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:47,370
users. So for established businesses,

101
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:51,654
the focus now would be on the revenue and profitability.

102
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:56,282
Consequently, for product teams, you can track metrics like

103
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:59,938
average revenue per user, customer lifetime value,

104
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:03,938
or free to pay conversions. These metrics tell you

105
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:07,514
whether the product and the business is

106
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:10,674
financially sustainable and whether we can

107
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:14,186
extract value for the business. So now that we have identified all

108
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,482
the product metrics, do we think we have all the data we need

109
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:21,014
in order to run the product discovery? Maybe not quite yet.

110
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:25,466
So, with product metrics, we often measure quantitative data

111
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,906
like clicks, reactions or source query, and they

112
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,930
tell you a lot about the what of the user behavior.

113
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:36,442
However, they also do not tell you about the why behind those actions

114
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:40,644
like motivations, frustrations or emotions of the users.

115
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:44,740
And this is where the qualitative data will come into play.

116
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:48,756
So, user interviews, usability tests or customer support

117
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,404
interactions are really good examples of qualitative data

118
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:56,268
that help us understand the user perspective. They comprehend

119
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:59,884
the quantitative data that are being collected automatically

120
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:03,962
from our product in order for us to have a full picture of users

121
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:07,814
when doing product discovery. So now that we have discussed how

122
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:11,582
we can leverage data in product discovery, let's take a closer look

123
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,918
at some examples of companies like Netflix or Spotify were

124
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:19,286
able to leverage the enormous amount of data that they

125
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,434
collect in order to further strengthen their product mode.

126
00:08:22,894 --> 00:08:26,942
So content is the most important product of Netflix, and they have really

127
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:30,566
disrupted the entertainment industry by leveraging a vast amount of

128
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,014
data to inform their decision on personalization

129
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:37,834
and the content acquisition strategy. So Netflix

130
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:41,674
invests heavily into personalization in order to improve

131
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,346
user engagement and retention. For example, on the

132
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,162
film recommendations, best layouts or thumbnail

133
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:53,250
images were decided based on individual user behavior,

134
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:56,996
and on this effort create a tremendous value.

135
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,584
It is estimated that an uplift of $1 billion

136
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:04,976
in revenue was created thanks to these improved retentions.

137
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,424
Another way Netflix uses data is to guide their content acquisition,

138
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:13,176
that is, to decide which title to acquire or to produce.

139
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,944
So they have an enormous amount of data on user viewing

140
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:20,864
habits, preference or user behavior, which then

141
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:24,400
can be used for them to identify the gaps in

142
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:27,764
their current offering and then make strategic investments

143
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:31,052
in producing original series or acquiring

144
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:35,100
existing content. So as a result, they were able to

145
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:38,420
produce or acquire widely successful series that

146
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,908
I'm sure all of us have heard of, like House

147
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,500
of Cards, Stranger Things, and Orange is a new

148
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:48,468
black. Quite similar to Netflix actually.

149
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:52,124
Spotify is also famous for the ability to leverage

150
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:55,738
a vast amount of data that they can collect on user listening habits,

151
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:59,754
preference and user behavior to identify and

152
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:02,826
build highly engaging features to make users

153
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,690
come back for more so their widely successful features.

154
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:11,218
Discovery Weekly is a prime example of personalization

155
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:15,002
in action. So every Monday, users will receive a

156
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:18,770
brand new playlist of songs that Spotify things that

157
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:22,228
you will love based on your history. Its like you

158
00:10:22,236 --> 00:10:26,164
are having a dj personally DJ actually, who knows

159
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:28,784
your music test better than you do.

160
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:32,468
Spotifys data driven approach actually goes

161
00:10:32,556 --> 00:10:35,828
way beyond the personalized playlist.

162
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:39,812
They use data to inform their overall product strategy and their content

163
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:44,028
offerings. For example, they notice that users are

164
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:47,236
manually creating different playlists for different activities,

165
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,488
for example, like work out. So they

166
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:54,520
decided to create automatic playlists catering

167
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:58,208
to those needs. And Spotify does not give this data

168
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:01,640
and insights for themselves. They actually use it

169
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:05,448
to empower the artists on the platforms. For example, in the

170
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:09,688
Spotify for artists app, those insights are being used for artists

171
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:13,880
to better understand their fans and which lead to better

172
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:17,206
targeted marketing and tour planning. Now that

173
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,038
we are moving on to the final part of this presentation, let's discuss

174
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:24,662
the factors required in order to effectively run

175
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:27,982
a data driven product discovery. But first,

176
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,326
let's quickly go through the common mistakes or the challenges when it

177
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,470
comes to leveraging data in product discovery, the first mistake

178
00:11:35,582 --> 00:11:38,990
is to focus on the wrong metrics. We actually talk

179
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:42,766
about this a lot at the very beginning of this presentation, so it

180
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,606
is critical to prioritize metrics that actually align with

181
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,718
the desired outcomes. The second mistake is actually being

182
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:54,678
too reliant on data to the extent that data becomes

183
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:58,886
a blocker instead of a leverage. This is particularly critical

184
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,614
for product teams working on early stage products where

185
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:06,206
data is usually limited. All the

186
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,654
product teams should be comfortable making decisions with imperfect

187
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:13,300
information that are required to build truly remarkable

188
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:16,940
products. So one challenge I would like to highlight here

189
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:20,676
is the potentially low quality of data. So when we use

190
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,100
data, make sure that the data is accurate and of

191
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:27,836
high quality because inaccurate data can lead to

192
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,420
misthalted measurements which subsequently lead

193
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:35,244
to sub optimal product decisions, keeping those

194
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:39,150
are mistakes and challenges in mind. Lets discuss the

195
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:42,598
factors required in order for us to effectively run

196
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:47,238
a data driven product discovery. The foundational factors

197
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:51,034
is to have clear goals and metrics in mind.

198
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:55,534
Basically, you need a sharp vision for your product and

199
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:58,886
define success metric based on that vision.

200
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,902
This subsequently will enable you to select the appropriate

201
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,404
data, point to measures and to check the progress.

202
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:10,480
The second factor that I would like to highlight here is actually to

203
00:13:10,512 --> 00:13:14,016
ensure that you had the right tool sets in order to transform

204
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,960
the raw data that you collect into valuable insights.

205
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:21,760
They could be like bi platforms, could be user research

206
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:24,484
tools or a B testing framework.

207
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:29,252
Not only that you have the right data and valuable insights attend,

208
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:33,092
you also need to ensure that you are promoting a data driven

209
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:36,428
culture so that data is valued not only within

210
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:39,464
your product team, but across the organization.

211
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:44,500
Factor number four is about experimentation.

212
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:48,412
The beauty of data is that it enables you to quantify

213
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:52,700
the impact of the experimentation, validating your assumptions

214
00:13:52,852 --> 00:13:55,948
which later optimize product decision during

215
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:59,518
the product discovery process. Last but not least

216
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,478
is about the data hygiene. A robust data collection

217
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:07,446
and validation process will ensure the accuracy

218
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,310
and the consistency of the raw data and subsequently the

219
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:14,494
high quality of your insights during the

220
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:18,086
product discovery process. And this brings me to

221
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,494
the end of my presentation today. Thank you very much for

222
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:25,006
your attention and if you have any questions, please share with me

223
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,374
over the email. Thank you and have a nice day.
