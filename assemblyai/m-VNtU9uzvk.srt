00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,764
Hello, and welcome to this session, why most data projects fail.

2
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:34,212
And I would say, more importantly, how to avoid it.

3
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:37,372
So let's start out by talking about what you see when

4
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:41,684
you go out on social media. When people talk about, why do data projects

5
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:45,292
fail? They think they fail because you chose snowflake or

6
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:48,916
databricks, or it was a data lake versus something

7
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,540
else, data warehouse, what have you, or it

8
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:56,324
was the programming language that you chose. You should have chosen

9
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:59,384
Python, should have chosen Java, should have chosen rust.

10
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:03,532
But in reality, is that why projects fail? Well,

11
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,212
let's talk about why. And to help back this up,

12
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:10,988
we have this number from Gartner. This also corresponds with

13
00:01:11,036 --> 00:01:15,172
my experience of how many data projects fail. And that is 85%

14
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:18,812
of data projects fail. And it brings up

15
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:22,740
the question, why is this so bad? Because that's a really, really terrible

16
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:26,236
number, 85%. So if you invert it,

17
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,404
then you say only 15% of data projects

18
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:32,956
actually succeed, which is still really bad.

19
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,044
So why can't more companies create more

20
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:40,940
value with data? That's a really good question, and it's one

21
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:44,824
I've spent a lot of time researching and trying to figure out why.

22
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,980
And part of this is that technology is just one

23
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:52,282
small piece. It's initially smaller,

24
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:55,746
definitely important. Not going to lie, it is important, but it

25
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,234
is one small piece of your success with data.

26
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:02,466
It is not the entire thing. Normally, when people

27
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,294
talk with data teams, they just focus on the data, on the technology.

28
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:10,642
What technologies did you use? Programming language. But that's just one small

29
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:14,738
piece. What we're instead going to focus on are the

30
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:18,296
questions, the right questions that you should be asking. We need

31
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,520
to know who, what, when,

32
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:25,592
where, and how. These are really important questions

33
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:30,004
that we need to answer before we start these data projects.

34
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:34,544
Who is the right people at the right ratios?

35
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:38,984
This is incredibly important because oftentimes companies will

36
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:43,008
say, I'm just going to hire a bunch of data scientists, and those data scientists

37
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:46,364
can go do this project. The reality is that those

38
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:50,204
projects don't really work well because we're

39
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:54,548
not missing. We don't have all the people we need. We need data scientists,

40
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,820
data engineers, and operations engineers.

41
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:01,900
And more importantly, we need them at the correct ratios, where we need

42
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:06,020
more data engineers than we need data scientists.

43
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:09,780
This is a really important part. Oftentimes teams

44
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:13,076
will have no data scientists or

45
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,184
just a few data engineers relative to a data scientist.

46
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:20,708
So this brings up this question that I often get,

47
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:24,316
especially for management, and they say, which team is most important?

48
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,892
Which team? If I just can only do one, which one should I do.

49
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:31,196
And the reality is that all three of these teams

50
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,548
are necessary for success. We need

51
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:38,334
data engineering, we need data science, and we need operations.

52
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:42,466
Each one of these three things does a very specific

53
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,114
part or is an important part of

54
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:49,538
this ecosystem. I have another talk that you can

55
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:52,970
watch where I talk about what happens when each one of these is missing.

56
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:56,794
But suffice it to say, if we're missing data engineering, we're missing

57
00:03:56,874 --> 00:04:00,586
key software engineering, distributed system skills

58
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,974
that data scientists do not have, and this is not their core competency.

59
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:09,206
Likewise with operations. If we're missing operations, we're missing

60
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,318
somebody who is making sure that things keep running well.

61
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,702
And likewise with data science. If we don't have data science,

62
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:18,654
I go so far as to say, why are we doing all this effort?

63
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:21,958
We're not getting that advanced analytics part.

64
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:25,870
That is a key part of the value creation, the optimal

65
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:29,514
value creation there. Next we go on to what.

66
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:33,706
What is the business value? This is incredibly important.

67
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,442
Doing data in and of itself, just for data or because

68
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:41,050
everybody else is doing it is not enough. What we have to do is

69
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:45,002
we have to say, what is the business value? If you're

70
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,250
just saying now, especially AI,

71
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:51,466
we're just going to do some AI, we will do this or

72
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,394
that. AI, that isn't enough. That isn't a business value.

73
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:59,462
AI is not a business value. Applying AI,

74
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:03,558
or applying data and AI to something to create business

75
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:07,190
value, yes, that's certainly applicable. But there

76
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:10,766
should be a clear and attainable path to value

77
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,174
creation. It is not just, we're going to go do AI

78
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:17,326
now, that doesn't work. That does not create any value.

79
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,654
It just creates a lot of strife and a lot of extra

80
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:23,978
work for the teams. So having a data

81
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:27,634
strategy isn't enough either. There needs to be a plan

82
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,586
and there needs to be execution. Oftentimes a company's

83
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,610
data strategy sometimes is just AI, frankly, or it says,

84
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:39,186
we're going to use our customer data to

85
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,734
understand our customers better. Not a data strategy either.

86
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:46,594
This isn't clear, this is part of why teams fail, is that

87
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:50,236
the executive management, perhaps the board c level, says,

88
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,776
here's our data strategy. We're going to use our data to

89
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,288
do something nebulous, something that you don't really

90
00:05:57,336 --> 00:06:00,648
know what's happening, or there's no real way to measure it,

91
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:04,368
no direction to it. So what we need to do is we

92
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:07,840
need to have a data strategy that has a clear plan, it has

93
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:11,120
clear execution. If we don't do this, we won't

94
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:14,764
be able to go through and actually execute on it.

95
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:17,604
When are you going to generate value?

96
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:22,704
Oftentimes there's kind of two opposite ends of this win.

97
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:27,276
Oftentimes the win is as soon as possible

98
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,876
or this unattainable deadline. So these

99
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,852
unattainable deadlines just aren't feasible. They set the team back

100
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:38,236
from the very beginning and make it so that they are not going

101
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,212
to be successful. They're never going to be successful because

102
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:46,070
they've been set up for success, for failure with a

103
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:49,566
deadline or a timeline that is not feasible at all.

104
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,446
It usually starts with a misunderstanding of

105
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,406
what the difficulty of data projects and the value

106
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,514
or how much time it takes to do a good data project.

107
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:04,758
They just think or have bought into a vendor or perhaps

108
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:08,942
read something. And that thing that they read said, it's easy.

109
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,398
Data projects are easy. You just need to use my software

110
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:16,034
and they out they go. But that isn't feasible.

111
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:19,798
And then on the opposite end, we have this when it's ready.

112
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:23,990
The issue with when it's ready is that those teams often never

113
00:07:24,062 --> 00:07:27,582
get something out the door. It's always, well, there's another

114
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:31,394
thing we need to do and another thing and another thing and another thing.

115
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:35,918
And we have this real issue with this dichotomy of

116
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:39,606
these teams never generate value because the

117
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,634
teams that are always behind, they're always behind, they're never getting,

118
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,634
they're never going to generate or live up to those expectations.

119
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:51,286
The, when it's ready, people, the biggest problem,

120
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,918
and I would say, especially now with the economy being

121
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:58,486
what it is, that projects that take too long

122
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,154
to generate value are going to get canceled.

123
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:04,718
And this is really important because oftentimes boards,

124
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:08,040
c level people will say, oh, you have enough time, don't worry.

125
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:12,172
Well, they also have short memories and they also have pressure from

126
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:16,100
various stakeholders, shareholders, for example, or money or

127
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:19,716
something's changed in the market. And when they said, you have

128
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,636
all the time in the world now, you don't actually have that time.

129
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,664
You actually have, well, you need to get something done yesterday.

130
00:08:28,284 --> 00:08:31,876
And so what I really strongly advise team

131
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,453
leads, managers of teams, data teams, is to

132
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:39,389
not take what they say, not at face value, but to

133
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:43,253
actually have a more feasible timeline

134
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:47,073
in mind. So don't take too long to generate value.

135
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:50,861
Those projects do get canceled. So what will happen

136
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:54,353
is that they'll promise too much. They'll,

137
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:59,485
they'll just never deliver on those expectations. So be

138
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,117
really careful there. This is how you set yourself, you set your team

139
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:06,486
up for failure. Data teams need to have a

140
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,438
very clear and plan and architecture

141
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:14,062
of where each piece is going to be done, where are you going to put

142
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:17,798
this piece of, where are you going to run things? Very,

143
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:21,430
very important. You need to have this plan

144
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:24,674
and or create this plan if you don't know where it is.

145
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:29,790
One of the most important parts that I would say here for

146
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,942
companies is, is that the data teams are often novice.

147
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:37,702
Frankly, they don't know what they're doing. They've never done this before

148
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:41,638
and it's difficult. And so what they'll do is they will say,

149
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:44,910
reach out to a vendor. Sometimes that's a cloud vendor,

150
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:48,062
sometimes that's another vendor,

151
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:51,862
and they'll look at their website and the website gives them this.

152
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:54,926
Oh, wow, here's this plan. Oh, you just do this,

153
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,754
this and this. Oh, that sounds good. I can do that.

154
00:09:58,394 --> 00:10:02,762
And so they'll go, follow that vendor plan. And guess what?

155
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:06,522
That vendor plan does not have any nuance to it.

156
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:10,274
It says, use our technology for every single thing.

157
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:14,066
And it's that way because it's written by a

158
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,934
marketing person who's paid to say, use our technology for everything.

159
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:22,682
That technology may not be the right tool, probably isn't the

160
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:26,622
right tool, but marketing people are paid to say,

161
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:30,070
use our technology for everything. And so as you

162
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:33,382
look at those vendor diagrams, those vendor white papers,

163
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:37,102
those vendors sort of things, yes, it's going

164
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:42,014
to be wrong because their recommendations are not going to recommend

165
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:45,794
that you use the right tool. They recommend that you use their tool.

166
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:50,038
And especially new teams, new data teams

167
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:53,874
don't understand that nuance. They don't understand that a team

168
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:58,656
or a team that is new will make these sorts of mistakes.

169
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,888
So it's really important that you get

170
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:05,504
either somebody who knows what they're doing, an architecture review,

171
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:09,608
something along those lines, to make sure that you are doing

172
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:11,804
the right and using the right things.

173
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,792
Next, it's how, how will

174
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:19,448
the plan be executed? So data teams

175
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:22,994
need a clear plan that they're executing.

176
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:27,934
And oftentimes when a team is tasked

177
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:31,834
or perhaps a brand new team is there,

178
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:35,158
they're going to be executing and they're going to say,

179
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:38,914
here's our plan. Except that plan will often change.

180
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:42,862
Or they'll go and say, we want to

181
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:46,854
do ten things all at once. That's not going to work.

182
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:50,702
I've seen it way too many times. Those sorts of teams that

183
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:54,414
go and they're brand new, or they're very excited about

184
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:57,982
this and they try to go do ten things, guess what happens?

185
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:01,366
They don't do any of those ten things. So what

186
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,038
I always talk about when I when I mentor a team and

187
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:08,526
I tell them, get a singular focus, one to

188
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,342
three things, ideally one or two things, not three things.

189
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,116
But sometimes executives get mad when

190
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,156
there's only three things or in their perception, not enough.

191
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,844
And so what we need is that focus, that focus on one to three

192
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:27,732
things. By doing those one to three things, you actually

193
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,020
get them done instead of trying to do

194
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:35,140
ten things at once. So what happens with ten things at once is that

195
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:38,668
you try to, you make very little progress. There's a lot of

196
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,758
switching in between them. And as a direct

197
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:46,414
result, instead of it taking maybe one

198
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:49,430
x the amount of time, so one times ten,

199
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:52,990
it actually takes two or three times that. Ten X, where if we would

200
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,494
just done the and focused,

201
00:12:56,614 --> 00:13:00,766
we would have gotten them done at a one X amount of time.

202
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,598
So by focusing, we actually get more

203
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:08,132
done faster rather than trying to do ten things

204
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:12,784
and never get anything done. Very, very important to get that focused.

205
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:16,980
If we don't do this, the teams will get bogged

206
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:19,504
down in too many different directions.

207
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:23,264
Now, I have a bonus here for you, and that is why.

208
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:27,388
Why is our data valuable? Eventually,

209
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:31,100
you're going to be be forced to come

210
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:34,540
to an accountant or some accounting meeting or somebody who's

211
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:38,102
looking at numbers, and they're going to say, you need to justify

212
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:42,070
why you're spending this amount on people, on cloud

213
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:44,834
costs, on licenses, whatever,

214
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:48,790
and you need to have very clear justification for

215
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:52,038
what you're doing. Otherwise, that bean counter,

216
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:54,834
that accountant is going to say, oh, well,

217
00:13:55,974 --> 00:14:00,054
it doesn't matter what you're doing. We should just cancel that, or we should reduce

218
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:04,244
your staff from 20 down to two people. You're just not generating enough value.

219
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:08,384
So it's always important to go through,

220
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:12,344
to have clear data on, or clear information or

221
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,872
clear numbers on what is the value of what you're doing?

222
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:19,384
Why is that data valuable? A very common question here

223
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:22,968
is where do you get that number from? And the number comes

224
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:25,364
from the business comes from the customer.

225
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:29,172
And how do you get that number? You ask them.

226
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,468
You actually work with your customer? Oddly enough,

227
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:36,324
yes. This may be surprising that we actually work with our business customer

228
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:40,060
not just to deliver on what they're asking, but to have

229
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:43,644
good numbers about what the value is that we're delivering.

230
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:46,784
Because eventually somebody is going to say,

231
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:50,064
what does ThAt Mean? What does that do for us?

232
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:54,120
I look for a ten x Roi in this investment. What that

233
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:58,624
means is if we're spending €100,000

234
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:02,248
on investing in either team or technology or something

235
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:05,856
like that, or on a project, we would look for a ten

236
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,592
X investment ROI. So spending that 100,000

237
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:12,424
euro should net. And we,

238
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:16,328
and I usually target that for a few reasons. One is that

239
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:19,736
as we talk to the business people about what the value is that we're

240
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,984
creating, they will actually perk up and they'll listen, oh, well,

241
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:26,896
we'll make a million, for example. They'll listen to that. They'll actually

242
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,096
put an investment into that. But it also gives

243
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,512
you some CusHiON where, let's say you don't hit that ten x for whatever

244
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:38,096
reason, you only hit five x. Well, you're now

245
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,488
at 500,000. So gives you some cushion,

246
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:44,776
and it gives you this ability to talk to the business in

247
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,444
the numbers or in the way that they want you to talk to them.

248
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:51,594
What we've seen here is we've answered those questions.

249
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:55,754
What you have to do, you as the audience, you listening,

250
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:59,462
you need to start by answering those questions,

251
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:03,366
then move on to the execution. If you're in the middle of a data

252
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,630
project right now and you heard one of those questions

253
00:16:06,662 --> 00:16:09,910
and you don't have an answer for it, you need to answer that now,

254
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,710
because you will eventually need to answer that question

255
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:17,810
in some fashion. Another thing that's important here is that not all

256
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:22,014
gaps are technology. Sometimes gaps are people

257
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:25,626
and technology. We need to check for that. So we need to

258
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,374
check for those gaps in the people and technology.

259
00:16:28,874 --> 00:16:32,250
So AI projects, they're rarely just,

260
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:35,946
hey, we need to put this new technology in place. Let's put

261
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,954
some spark in place now with Genai.

262
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:42,638
Let's put chap GPT in place, and that will solve all the problems.

263
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:47,270
It will, may solve a problem. It may add ten problems.

264
00:16:47,462 --> 00:16:51,054
It's just a, it's just one piece of the puzzle.

265
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:54,478
So, thinking, oftentimes, technical teams especially

266
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:58,558
think it's, oh, we just, it's a Lego piece. We're missing that Lego piece.

267
00:16:58,646 --> 00:17:01,934
Stick it in there. All good. What is,

268
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:04,982
is that it's often an organizational,

269
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:07,554
a people and a skill change,

270
00:17:07,913 --> 00:17:11,889
where even if we make that change in data, we start putting

271
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:16,017
this data in place, what will happen is that the organization

272
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:19,705
isn't ready to use it or the people aren't ready to use it,

273
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:23,209
or the people in the data team don't have the skill.

274
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:26,513
Programming especially. Sometimes they've taken their data

275
00:17:26,553 --> 00:17:30,321
warehouse team and said, oh, you're data engineers now without

276
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:33,357
the programming skills and they have no programming skills.

277
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:37,446
These are big problems. So it is really important that

278
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,494
we check for these gaps. These gaps are part of what are going to

279
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:45,782
make you fail in your projects. In my experience,

280
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:49,214
and I have a pretty significant amount of experience not just

281
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,926
consulting in this, but talking to others, interviewing others,

282
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,114
doing surveys. And that is around

283
00:17:57,094 --> 00:18:01,372
when you get help. It's really important to do this because

284
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:05,100
these problems don't fix themselves without specific and

285
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:08,548
concerted effort. Put it different ways, if you

286
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:11,692
don't put effort into this, if you see a problem and

287
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,664
you don't put the direct effort into fixing it,

288
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:18,584
they will not change. It will not change for you. It doesn't.

289
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:21,624
There's the saying, time heals all wounds.

290
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:25,556
That isn't going to happen. What is going to happen is

291
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,182
that the same problems are going to keep on repeating. So there's a

292
00:18:29,198 --> 00:18:31,550
lot of different types of help out there.

293
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:35,670
Outsourcing, technical consulting, management consulting,

294
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:39,518
lots of different possibilities, each one. For example,

295
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:43,302
let's say you're a company that has no software engineering prowess.

296
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:46,862
Maybe outsourcing is the way to go rather than building a team.

297
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,542
Or if you do have a team that's floundering, probably need some technical

298
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:54,710
consulting or management consulting. There's a lot of possibilities out

299
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:58,592
there, but unless you avail yourselves of them, you won't

300
00:18:58,648 --> 00:19:02,440
get your help and your fix. So most of

301
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:06,280
you who are watching this, you probably have a project that's going to start,

302
00:19:06,352 --> 00:19:09,792
about to start. Sometimes what I like to do is actually

303
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:13,248
invert it and say, turn a situation upside

304
00:19:13,296 --> 00:19:16,784
down and say, rather than saying,

305
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:20,392
where do you want to go and

306
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:23,748
how do you get there? What? Maybe we just say,

307
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,144
what happens if all of our plans go wrong? What would have happened?

308
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:31,036
Now think about that for a second. What if sometimes you

309
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,384
come into these projects with rosy colored glasses that says,

310
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:37,980
oh, yes, we're going to, everything's going to

311
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:41,452
work out, but if we invert that and say, okay, well, what if it

312
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:44,908
goes wrong? What would have went wrong? Well, it would have went wrong

313
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:48,020
because the CEO will change his mind every millisecond,

314
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:51,332
or the marketing people will do this or

315
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:55,372
we won't get the resources for that. And by looking at that and looking at

316
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:59,116
the possible failures, you can start to change your plan and

317
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,424
make sure that your plan is more resilient to change.

318
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:05,784
Another question I like to ask is,

319
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:09,984
how good is a data engineer at a data science task?

320
00:20:10,364 --> 00:20:13,868
So think about that for a second, would you,

321
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:17,224
if you're a data scientist or you're a data science manager,

322
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:20,970
would you say, oh, we need an advanced model. Let's have

323
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:24,658
a data engineer do that and say,

324
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:28,458
okay, why are we having our data scientists do data

325
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:31,650
engineering tasks? Because they're really not well, or they're not

326
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:35,614
good at it. Quantifiably not very good.

327
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,854
And I do have a lot of data on this as well.

328
00:20:39,394 --> 00:20:42,914
So why are we doing this? Another inverted

329
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:46,716
question that we would say is, what would the business say if

330
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,580
our project was canceled or the cluster was turned off or whatever

331
00:20:50,612 --> 00:20:53,844
is providing that data just went away. What value?

332
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:57,468
What cluster? I don't care. Those are really bad

333
00:20:57,516 --> 00:21:00,988
signs that the project is generating. No. Or low value.

334
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:04,940
And that means that the business doesn't care about it. So when somebody's

335
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:09,076
looking to cut costs, somebody's looking to do something, those are the projects

336
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,112
that they're going to look at. But on the other side, if. When we say,

337
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,104
oh, the business is going to. If the business says,

338
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:19,504
oh, you can't do that. I look at that report every

339
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,840
day. I look at that report every morning, and I base all these decisions

340
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:26,728
on that. Those are two very different sorts of views of

341
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:30,840
data and value creation. And if you aren't on that side where

342
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:34,240
people are saying, I need that, I use that every day,

343
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:37,764
that's a big problem. So why shouldn't you

344
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:41,944
copy someone else's architecture? That's a pretty big problem.

345
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:45,492
You heard me talk about it a little bit and say,

346
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:49,012
hey, if you go to a conference, and maybe

347
00:21:49,148 --> 00:21:53,064
even at this conference, people will say, here's our architecture.

348
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:57,356
More likely, you shouldn't copy it because

349
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,828
they're doing something different. They have a different goal. In fact,

350
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:04,626
I've worked and consulted at companies who are. Who are competitors

351
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,370
to each other, so same exact space, same exact industry.

352
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:12,218
And their architectures were different because they were trying to do two

353
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:16,722
different things. And what often happens in these architecture

354
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:19,850
talks is that they don't talk about the nuances,

355
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:23,330
they don't talk about the reason I chose this or we chose that.

356
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:27,442
There's some problems there. I think an interesting

357
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:32,192
example of this was Uber. Sometimes companies

358
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:35,432
will just show you this diagram all the way at the end of here's

359
00:22:35,448 --> 00:22:38,944
the most complicated thing that's possible, but what they don't show

360
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:42,520
is how they got there. I think Uber was very interesting.

361
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:45,952
You can see the link down there to their diagram,

362
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:50,648
but you can see their

363
00:22:50,696 --> 00:22:53,864
data, their diagram. They started pretty

364
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:57,464
simply, and their first generation

365
00:22:57,804 --> 00:23:00,940
started very simply. Second generation got

366
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:03,664
a little bit more complicated. You see a few more things.

367
00:23:03,964 --> 00:23:08,424
Their third generation got even more complicated, even more things.

368
00:23:09,044 --> 00:23:12,700
So there is a progression. And so what I really want you

369
00:23:12,732 --> 00:23:16,716
to think about and think through is don't overengineer

370
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,308
and don't copy. Just because you saw that diagram

371
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:23,792
from Uber. Doesn't mean that you, you should be copying Uber.

372
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:27,520
Uber did something for Uber. They didn't do something for

373
00:23:27,552 --> 00:23:30,084
you. So just doing that,

374
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:34,136
that could mean overengineering. That could mean underengineering.

375
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,384
Could be doing something that is completely unnecessary,

376
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:41,256
complete overkill for you, and only move

377
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,264
when, when it's necessary. As you saw, each one of those generations

378
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:48,792
was in response to a limitation that they started

379
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:52,146
hitting. Maybe you won't hit that limitation. Maybe you

380
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,882
don't have that limitation. Another thing to think about is

381
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:59,854
I ran a survey for data teams in 2023

382
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:03,254
and I've received 81 responses,

383
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:08,730
responses from all different sizes of companies maturity levels.

384
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:12,134
You can see the URL there if you want to go read it.

385
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:15,862
And what I did is I tried to look at the worst and the best.

386
00:24:16,058 --> 00:24:19,206
I tried to look at the value generation that they were doing and

387
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,046
say, who is the worst? And then looked at

388
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:27,102
what they did, what their responses were. For example,

389
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:30,838
here we see the lowest and highest creation. So the

390
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,994
red being the high value creation, blue being low value creation.

391
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:38,726
And these are their challenges. And what's interesting here is that

392
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,474
they both faced basically the same challenges.

393
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:46,672
You can see them pretty even across. However,

394
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:50,464
the high value creation, they faced some early mistakes.

395
00:24:50,584 --> 00:24:54,496
High value faced more advanced things. But when

396
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,392
you looked at the methodologies, they were using more methodologies,

397
00:24:58,448 --> 00:25:01,816
they had put effort into saying, this is how we're

398
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,144
going to organize ourselves. This is how we're going to structure

399
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:08,404
ourselves. Not everything is about technology.

400
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,438
What we see right here in this diagram is methodology.

401
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:16,070
Organization actually mattered quite a bit here.

402
00:25:16,102 --> 00:25:19,430
We also talk about the number of teams. Sometimes teams

403
00:25:19,462 --> 00:25:23,994
would say, oh, we can get by with just data engineering or just data science.

404
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:27,918
And we can see in this diagram that the highest

405
00:25:28,086 --> 00:25:31,270
value creation in teams was with one

406
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:34,438
to three teams. Two to three teams. Really,

407
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:38,198
really important that if you are trying to struggle with, let's say, just data

408
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:41,934
science, you're going to hit that low value creation very

409
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:45,686
important. As well as best practices. The high

410
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,774
value creation teams did the most number of best practices,

411
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:53,474
whereas the low value creation teams did the fewest.

412
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:58,262
It's very important to do those best practices, to consistently

413
00:25:58,318 --> 00:26:02,038
do those best practices. And that brings us to data

414
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:05,438
teams. My book is called a unified management

415
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:09,186
model for successful. What we need is all three teams

416
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,522
working together to create value from data.

417
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:16,614
We have our data science. These are the ones that are the consumers.

418
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:21,114
They consume those data products. They create that advanced

419
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:24,014
analytic and they work with data engineering,

420
00:26:24,794 --> 00:26:28,106
where data engineering is creating these data products. They make

421
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,586
sure that the software engineering sound, that the distributed systems

422
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,990
are sound. And then we have operations.

423
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:37,638
Operations make sure that everything is running smoothly.

424
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:41,686
It allows the customers and the business to depend on a

425
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,374
working system. It's only once we have all three of these things

426
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:48,794
that we can truly be successful with our data teams.

427
00:26:49,294 --> 00:26:52,558
Some of this is, I had to go pretty high level.

428
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:55,574
I have a book, it's called data teams, if you'd like to read it.

429
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:59,158
It goes much deeper into the teams, how the teams work together,

430
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:03,234
as well as case studies. Now, those case studies are really important because

431
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:07,258
I put a lot of effort into not just my research

432
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:10,362
and my own experience, but I wanted to hear others.

433
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:14,210
So there's full case studies of companies with ten plus years of

434
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:16,970
experience doing this and what that looked like.

435
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:20,970
So data teams is a great resource for understanding

436
00:27:21,002 --> 00:27:24,962
this. So with that, I'd like to thank you for attending this session

437
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:28,234
and I wish you the best of luck in your data projects.
