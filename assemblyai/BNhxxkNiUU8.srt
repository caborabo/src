00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,486
Hello. Welcome to this talk. Today we'll be talking about

2
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:31,846
reliable monitoring and alerts, everything you need to

3
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:35,814
know of how to set up your dashboards and

4
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:39,414
alerts for your cloud applications. My name is

5
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:42,786
Israel and I am brazilian,

6
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:45,846
living in the UK for the past two and a half years.

7
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:50,062
This is a picture of my family. I married to

8
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:54,160
my wife and we have a son, six years old right now.

9
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,370
Well, from hobbies and things, I love playing games,

10
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,360
traveling. This is a picture of us traveling across

11
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,066
Europe and currently I'm a software engineer at

12
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:12,242
Meta. Brief outline of what we'll be talking about today

13
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:15,886
so first I want to touch why we want to talk about alerts

14
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:19,526
and dashboards and metrics and other things. Then we

15
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:23,362
go a bit in metrics, how to set up dashboards,

16
00:01:23,426 --> 00:01:27,442
what is interesting for alerts, and how to learn from

17
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:31,434
failures that will eventually happen. So first,

18
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:34,154
why is it important?

19
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:37,690
So we have a question, like are the systems up right now?

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,162
Is everything all right? Is everything working as expected?

21
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:43,840
Are our metrics stable enough?

22
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,426
Or at least are we keeping the expected trains? If you are expecting

23
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:54,582
to grow every month, is it growing ultimately,

24
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:58,594
can I sleep in peace? Can I rest assured that

25
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:02,526
the system is healthy, in place while I'm

26
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,642
taking a vacation, while I'm sleeping, and be sure that I will be alerted

27
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:08,520
if anything goes wrong?

28
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,230
Well, metrics is all about what do we want to monitoring.

29
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,998
It will be different depending on your scenario,

30
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:22,858
depending on what you want to do. But look

31
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:26,650
at this engine room for

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,134
ship. I don't know which ship is it, but we can see lots of

33
00:02:31,332 --> 00:02:34,720
different things to check.

34
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,474
The ship is going well if the engine has the right pressure,

35
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:42,462
the right tuning for everything. And this is important

36
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:46,322
because when you are in a ship, you want to make sure the ship is

37
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:50,514
working properly. And similarly, that's what we want for our cloud

38
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:53,826
applications and our systems. So we

39
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:57,750
have two types of metrics. First, I would say the business

40
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,346
metrics. They are the KPIs goals,

41
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:05,350
user behaviors, everything that we want

42
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,606
the product to be, everything that we want the users

43
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:12,954
to see what's affecting our business.

44
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:16,278
And on the other side, not detached

45
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:20,134
from it, we have the technical metrics. So we are talking about response time,

46
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,902
we are talking about error rate, machine constraints like

47
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:27,550
CPU memory, I O network,

48
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,802
things like that. And for this presentation,

49
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:35,490
we'll be focusing more on the technical

50
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,682
examples, but it's valid for all of them.

51
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:43,090
So you can set up dashboards and alerts that affect

52
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,886
both. Now let's dive into

53
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:51,142
dashboards. All we need to know at

54
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:54,566
a glance. So dashboards, what they

55
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:57,882
are, they are a visual representation of key

56
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:01,466
metrics, indicators, trends that we

57
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:04,650
want to observe, insights into

58
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,060
the current state of the system,

59
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,498
and it provides us with continuous monitoring

60
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:17,006
and analysis. Usually we want to see it over a

61
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:20,206
period of time, basically like the past x days,

62
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:22,926
hours, weeks, the past month,

63
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:26,318
fortnite and things like that. And let's

64
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:30,306
take a look at an example to understand better what's a

65
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:33,634
dashboard and how we want to look at it.

66
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:37,022
So this I took from the new relic

67
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,538
website and introduction part of it, neuralic,

68
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:43,890
is one of the most used ones. This is not sponsored,

69
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,270
so just an example. And here

70
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,210
we can see lots of information in the

71
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,310
dashboard. It can be a bit overwhelming,

72
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,314
but I want to highlight two things here. First,

73
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:02,298
we have different widgets looking at different things. I already mentioned

74
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:05,946
error rate, throughput, transactions, time apdex score,

75
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:08,698
and we have many other things that could be observed.

76
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:13,182
And we also usually have period

77
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,882
selection here, 30 minutes. But sometimes you want to see

78
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:20,654
if something is stable based on differences anality.

79
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:24,350
So for example, depending on your user behavior

80
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,974
or your system distribution, it might be worth

81
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:31,478
checking, for example, weekly. So you would see

82
00:05:31,644 --> 00:05:35,000
daily going up and down, for example,

83
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,522
depending on if it's day or night. And that

84
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:42,090
could help identify if a system behavior

85
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,090
corresponding to what's expected to that seasonality.

86
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,222
Okay, now that we saw a dashboard, let's talk about

87
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:53,982
some useful visualizations for dashboard. So first

88
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:58,222
one already mentioned is a time series. We want

89
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:00,880
time series to display trends over time,

90
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,702
and it's easy to spot

91
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:07,570
and see spikes and seasonalities.

92
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,070
So it could be weekly, daily, hourly,

93
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,386
any type of things. But most importantly, when you look at

94
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:18,262
it, you can clearly see when it's going up or down and

95
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:22,402
compare with the historical data. You have to check if it's

96
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:27,250
something that's expected, it's something that's weird

97
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,034
and not expected. For example, let's say you have error rate and

98
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:35,066
it's usually stable at 0.1% and

99
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:39,754
suddenly it jumps to 1%. I mean, it's a ten

100
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:43,326
time jump, it's a significant jump, and you definitely want to take a look at

101
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:46,846
it, especially if you know, for example, a version has

102
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:50,560
been rolled out and it could be that this version is

103
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,714
introducing some new errors in your system. Maybe it's even time

104
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:59,442
to stop the rollout. Another thing,

105
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:03,650
it's also like usually a time series but stacked area

106
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,426
chart when you want to see the cumulative contribution to

107
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:11,014
a total value. So let's say for example, you want to monitoring the

108
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:15,862
percentage of users using your application through

109
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:19,014
different platforms. You want to see, for example, mobile, Android,

110
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:22,266
iOS, the website

111
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:25,882
or mobile website, depending if you wanted to make this difference.

112
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:30,634
And you can see it over time if it's decreasing and increasing

113
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:33,806
something. And you could see,

114
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,694
let's say for example, you have a critical bug on your Android application,

115
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:42,282
and you would see that the Android version percentage

116
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:44,110
in the chart drops,

117
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,920
disappears, or something like that.

118
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,934
There are many ones, but there are bar charts, pie charts,

119
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:57,266
heat maps, scatter plot, cloud charts, histograms, waterfall charts,

120
00:07:57,298 --> 00:08:00,440
but don't get overwhelmed by it.

121
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,582
We need to know how to read those charts, we need to know what they

122
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:07,814
mean, and most important, what action we

123
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:11,606
want to take from them. So if you have a chart that's showing

124
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:15,446
a deviation, something weird that you can't interpret,

125
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:18,346
that's probably useless. So be simple.

126
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:22,110
I highlighted two of the main ones, but be simple,

127
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,422
understand this, understand what metrics, remember,

128
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:29,230
we need to define what metrics we want to observe.

129
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,306
And some of these tools will probably already give

130
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:38,194
predefined metrics to follow. And as we

131
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:41,982
get used to it, as we think, hey, I should have observative

132
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:45,854
lead for some specific things. It might checking

133
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:50,246
other things. So for example, bar charts, I usually check to

134
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:54,098
see the amount of a specific error

135
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:57,538
in the error rate, so the contribution. So let's say we have an increase in

136
00:08:57,564 --> 00:09:00,762
the error rate, and I quickly look at a bar

137
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:05,046
chart for the past hour to see what's the error that's

138
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:09,260
more frequent, and we can quickly find

139
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,900
the issue, or at least quicker find the issue.

140
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,234
Important about dashboards is like plot

141
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:22,234
useful guidelines. So sometimes you have what's the value expected.

142
00:09:22,282 --> 00:09:25,986
So let's say, for example, you expect the error rate to

143
00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:29,394
be between 0.1 and 0.2. So maybe you

144
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:33,454
want to have like two lines plotted in the dashboard

145
00:09:33,502 --> 00:09:37,302
to help you see if it's quite

146
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:40,838
close to one of the thresholds or not.

147
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:43,874
Also plot useful limits.

148
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:47,234
We'll talk about alerts

149
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:51,094
later, but think about something that you want to be alerted

150
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:54,730
by. Maybe it's worth also bringing this to a dashboard.

151
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,554
Also have handful filters you

152
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:01,882
might want to filter specific surfaces animation.

153
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:05,166
Let's say you identified through the bash dashboard that the

154
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,654
Android application has increased error rate.

155
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:12,062
So you might want to filter. Okay, now show me only

156
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:16,066
events coming from the dashboard from the Android application,

157
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:19,666
and then you can check, oh, what is happening,

158
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:23,410
when did it start? And quicker find

159
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,126
your way through it. Another very important

160
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:30,402
thing is that dashboards need to be actionable.

161
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,440
So if you have,

162
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,206
let's keep the example. Error rate. Error rate is up.

163
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:40,778
Okay, why? So which errors are happening?

164
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:44,026
And. Okay, show me the stack trace. I found that this is the

165
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:47,366
most common error. Just click through it, go to the stack,

166
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:50,814
trace the bugs, too. So it's important to

167
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:55,406
have easy access to drill down

168
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,214
specific metrics, specific widgets that we want.

169
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:03,314
But be careful. It's also ideal not to

170
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:07,220
build like a too overwhelming dashboard because

171
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,746
again, this is something we want to take a look by,

172
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:15,086
a quick glance, understand the status of the system,

173
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,710
and if it's too complex, too overwhelming, too much information,

174
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,680
we'll end up losing important things instead of

175
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,630
having them clearly jump into our faces.

176
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,006
That's it about dashboards. Let's talk about alerts a

177
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:33,546
bit. So, alerts, I like to say, like, it's because we

178
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,674
all deserve peace of mind and they help in that. So what

179
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:41,990
are alerts? A good example is like the cuckoo clock.

180
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,182
So at specific times it just says, hey,

181
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:48,814
it's 05:00 p.m. It's 04:00 p.m. It's 03:00 p.m. Or something

182
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:52,858
like that. I don't know why it got reversed, but you got it. So alerts

183
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:56,658
are basically automated notifications. But of course you don't want to

184
00:11:56,664 --> 00:12:00,802
be notified because it's 05:00 p.m. But you probably want to be notified that

185
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:04,578
the error rate spiked by ten times. And so

186
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:08,658
we basically define what we want to observe.

187
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:12,114
What metrics? What are the thresholds

188
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:15,462
you define? Okay, above this, alert me.

189
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:19,626
Send like a message to my phone, or if it's way above it,

190
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:23,398
call me, or something like that. And the idea of alerts

191
00:12:23,414 --> 00:12:27,446
is that they prompt immediate attention. It's usually targeted

192
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:31,086
to specific individuals or teams. So some companies I

193
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:35,402
know, they have a team responsible to monitoring,

194
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:39,098
so they are usually like the first level of monitoring.

195
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:42,990
They would receive an alerts, look at dashboards, identify which team

196
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,374
should be our individual, should be escalated

197
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:50,994
to, and then involve them. But most of the companies don't have that.

198
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:55,006
It's just like tied to specific people or specific teams, depending on what

199
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:59,298
the alert is, and then we can action. So alerts

200
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:03,942
are very important to keeping us

201
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:07,758
up to date to anything that's seemingly

202
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:10,890
going wrong, not only going wrong.

203
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,506
So I will explain that, too. So, alerts for peace of mind.

204
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:18,346
If you want to relax like this person in

205
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:22,554
the picture, usually we want to be alerted

206
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,806
only by critical metrics. So if the

207
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:29,102
alerts are too noisy. By noisy, I mean

208
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:33,374
you get alerted every five or ten minutes or every hour or

209
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,458
even every day, you will probably end up ignoring them. And that

210
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:41,186
completely misses the point of the alert. So we want to be alerted by

211
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,494
the critical metrics, be it business metrics or technical

212
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:48,542
metrics. We want to have clear severity

213
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:51,766
levels. So if it's a critical failure, let's say

214
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:55,638
the system is not responding anymore or your main page

215
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:59,900
is out, it's just returning 404.

216
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,140
We need to understand that.

217
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,046
And ideally we have different levels

218
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,626
of alerting for that too. But also we want to have alerts

219
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:15,898
selecting up, allowing us to have early visibility

220
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:19,774
of possible issues. So I remember once in

221
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:24,094
a company, we almost had the database

222
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:27,810
down because it was slowly,

223
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,138
I mean, not too slowly, but too fast either.

224
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:35,970
So the disk was getting full, basically,

225
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,542
TLDr disk was getting full. And the problem

226
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:43,478
is that it was getting full in a pace that

227
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:47,590
avoided the alerts for sudden movements.

228
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,974
But also it was quick enough that it

229
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:55,062
would happen over weekend. And on a Friday,

230
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:57,850
people found out, okay, we have a problem,

231
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,662
but if we had an alert, for example, oh,

232
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:05,614
every time it trends, like next week,

233
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:09,662
we'll be out of storage. It could

234
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:13,758
save us some headaches in

235
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:16,686
the future. And similar to dashboards,

236
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:19,922
we want alerts to be actionable and clear.

237
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:23,426
So if you receive an alerts, we should know exactly what

238
00:15:23,448 --> 00:15:26,898
this alert means and what we should do. What we should do could be.

239
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:29,874
Okay, let's take a look at the dashboard specific dashboard.

240
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:34,230
Understand this more to see if there is a problem. What's the problem going on?

241
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,522
But also, is there an escalation path? Is there someone

242
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:40,874
I should call or someone that should be

243
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:43,420
working to solve this issue?

244
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,620
And on the other hand,

245
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,302
if no alert was fired, it should

246
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:54,334
also be a signal that everything is right. Of course,

247
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:58,474
we sometimes miss observing

248
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:02,342
something. We'll talk about it later. But an ideal

249
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:06,402
alert setup would be everything critical is monitored. And if

250
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:08,660
no alert is open,

251
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,234
it should be fair and okay to assume everything is all right.

252
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,934
Okay, so moving then to the last part, how to learn

253
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:23,394
from failures. So we can set up dashboards, we can set up alerts,

254
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:26,630
but things will break, things will happen.

255
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,298
And this is the art of asking why problems

256
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:33,690
happen. This is a very simple one. I tried

257
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,122
to look some accidents or things, but I thought they

258
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:41,710
looked like too scary and they triggered something for someone.

259
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,790
So, okay, let's take a simple exam. Just a flat tire,

260
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,726
problems happen and maybe this

261
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:53,294
is fine. No, this is probably not fine in the

262
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:57,122
sense that we need to act. It's fine in the sense that we

263
00:16:57,256 --> 00:17:01,186
don't need to panic. But we need to act. If you keep

264
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,942
the flat tire, you can't continue with a car,

265
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:07,320
at least not for a long distance at least.

266
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,050
Okay, how can we learn from failures? How can we investigate,

267
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,880
make the right questions, and improve our

268
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,250
system, improve our observability,

269
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,770
improve our alerts, dashboards and monitoring?

270
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,438
So first we have to ask, why did this incident

271
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:30,006
happen? And usually it's not a matter of

272
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,582
asking why, receiving one answer and be

273
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:37,200
happy with it. So I have an example that I love.

274
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,680
Well, let's say the server was shut down,

275
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,162
and let's get out of the cloud thing because it

276
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:49,746
gets things more complex for this example, but let's say you have a

277
00:17:49,848 --> 00:17:53,298
data center and suddenly the server was shut down.

278
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:56,318
So you check there and, oh,

279
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:59,542
actually the power is out. Someone unplugged it,

280
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:03,814
or it was unplugged. So you just plug it in back and server is back.

281
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:07,480
Okay, that's fine. Problem solved, right? Yeah,

282
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,994
problem solved for that time. But we also have to

283
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:14,810
ask, why was it unplugged?

284
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,446
Did someone pass by and accidentally unplug

285
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:23,486
it? Did something happen and someone,

286
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:26,894
by panic unplugged it? Or maybe like the

287
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:30,430
janitor unknowingly knew what was happening

288
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,806
there, unplugged it to clean it, and forgot to plug it

289
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:37,746
back. I mean, there could say several reasons, and we need to keep asking

290
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:41,826
why this happened until we get to the root cause. This is

291
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:45,358
the first part. And then we have to ask what could

292
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:49,494
have prevented it? Is there any alert that could

293
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:53,382
have triggered. Is that any alert that

294
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:57,874
actually showed us a problem? And then is there any alert that could have triggered

295
00:18:57,922 --> 00:19:01,034
earlier in case of the server? Of course

296
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:04,186
not. But maybe there would be an alert in the sense that,

297
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:08,010
hey, someone got access to the server room. Is it okay?

298
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,894
Is it an authorized person? Okay, I'm probably extrapolating

299
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:16,510
the example here, but just trying to give some hints and ideas.

300
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,898
We also have to understand, were we caught off guard,

301
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:24,290
how can we detect this earlier? And so on. So every

302
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,386
error, everything that happens that is significant enough to

303
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:32,158
be a problem, I think it should be investigated

304
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:36,274
and a plan should be made to improve

305
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:39,430
it. We can improve, of course, the system itself,

306
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,974
fix the bug, improve the scalability and

307
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:48,140
so on. But we also need to do like,

308
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,934
improve the dashboards, improve the alerts,

309
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:56,410
and make sure that if we get close

310
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,594
to having the same issue, we catch it as

311
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:03,422
early as possible. As I said,

312
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:06,526
any missing dashboards, any missing alerts, anything that could have

313
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:10,730
been better. Yeah. So to wrap up, we talked about metrics

314
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,046
why we should select metrics, some types of

315
00:20:14,068 --> 00:20:17,850
metrics we should select dashboards. We looked at some examples

316
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:22,106
what we should look how to set up use for visualizations.

317
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:25,938
We talked about alerts, setting up good practices

318
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:29,750
for alerts escalations and last we talked about

319
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,878
learning from failures. Some tips to investigate and

320
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:37,574
improve failures. Thank you. That was

321
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:41,494
it. I hope it was good for you. Enjoyed it

322
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:45,650
and feel free to connect with me and LinkedIn.
