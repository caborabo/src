1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,394
Hi everyone, today I will talk about length shingle.

2
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:28,594
First let's do it myself. My name is Alessio Majelista.

3
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:32,466
I live in Brazil and I am skilled in

4
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,814
node, JS, Python, Php, NGo.

5
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:40,866
What is Langchango? Langchango is a part or

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,814
fork of LangChain.

7
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:47,002
So this document is new

8
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:49,174
and not decomplete.

9
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:53,714
You can use linko with it lemma.

10
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:58,014
It's very simple. This simple

11
00:00:58,134 --> 00:01:02,234
is here I'll open AI,

12
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:07,550
you have example. If you can use

13
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:11,954
it with OpenAI Mistro this is a new victory.

14
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:18,954
Have some agents memories

15
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:23,422
models about

16
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:27,194
where it says use local is not

17
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:33,434
completely documentation and in GitHub

18
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:39,742
you can see the preview of new victories

19
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:44,094
like Marita ki. This model from

20
00:01:44,134 --> 00:01:47,654
Brazil individual is

21
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:53,642
some place I

22
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:57,494
don't know and

23
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:03,338
heavy memory adds accurations and

24
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:05,814
other features here perplexity.

25
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:16,231
So why can't use this for

26
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:19,495
using you can use vector,

27
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:23,095
stars, properties, document loaders for Reggie

28
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:26,003
agents, LMS, exchanges,

29
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:31,399
link have integrations with OpenAI,

30
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,807
Polyama, Mix, Row, Google AI, LMA,

31
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,670
CPp, LMA file, Nvidia,

32
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:42,554
Perplex and Whisper is coming for

33
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:47,902
let's write a code with langchango.

34
00:02:48,078 --> 00:02:50,834
First you need the import some packages.

35
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:56,634
After this and my main method

36
00:02:57,174 --> 00:03:01,594
you have the new instance of OpenAI.

37
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:06,362
For example I can use open AI and I

38
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:10,218
use call function. This function is very simple

39
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:14,338
because I set the syntax, my context

40
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:18,378
and a prompt. A simple prompt you can use

41
00:03:18,426 --> 00:03:25,010
temperature for default is default

42
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:29,870
is six and

43
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:33,394
you can use the stopworks or not.

44
00:03:34,134 --> 00:03:37,794
Default is empty. Around this

45
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:47,634
the first man to walk on the moon has nail

46
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:53,154
because the next work is Aristotle.

47
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:58,248
When used lengthango you can do integration on other APIs

48
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,720
like OpenAI schema we

49
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:05,352
have integration with Grok.

50
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:08,744
It's very very simple. I set model,

51
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:11,164
I set token and base rail.

52
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:16,484
The code is equal above

53
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,514
the difference is options parents.

54
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:27,430
Then I have new

55
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:31,438
OpenAI context call

56
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:33,314
methods. I run this.

57
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:42,514
The first main to walk on the mob has neo.

58
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:46,874
Okay I can use with envision two

59
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:52,444
when using Vg like an API you can't use

60
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:56,144
AMD. So if you use

61
00:04:56,484 --> 00:05:00,388
Nvidia you can't use MD for rag.

62
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:03,784
Okay I set by Israel

63
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:09,460
model token run

64
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:10,064
this.

65
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:18,444
The output is here.

66
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:23,584
This example I use something

67
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:26,684
different like I use message content.

68
00:05:27,304 --> 00:05:31,088
The type system is system

69
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:34,644
and shaft message type woman is user.

70
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:38,592
I use content generate content

71
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:43,200
sorry. And I set with maxtoken

72
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:49,240
and I use stream funk. This functions return

73
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,804
and show here.

74
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:57,208
So now I show for you when you can

75
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,444
use langchango with reg.

76
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:06,464
Now I will show for you how use language for

77
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:10,190
rag applications. How does it

78
00:06:10,222 --> 00:06:14,154
work? First you need to load the document

79
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:18,478
of rpdfe or test file or

80
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:21,918
database. You do

81
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:26,014
split for this document save in

82
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:30,062
vector star do a

83
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:33,770
revade split or carry and

84
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:37,094
then use prompt send for lms.

85
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:41,386
It's very simple. Okay for example

86
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,214
you need to use some packages like vector store.

87
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:49,842
I'm using quidrant for example but you

88
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:53,730
can you you could use the pipe

89
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:57,866
or pages vector store and

90
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,670
agent chains document loader

91
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:05,726
images OpenAI

92
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,830
for example I use this OpenAI because I

93
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:14,014
want to use the Nvidia but Nvidia this

94
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,874
dot heavy images for this version of

95
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:21,846
ncingo schemas attach the

96
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:27,002
splitter and vector star hydrogen the

97
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:30,066
first step I need to get

98
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,298
my file this case PDF file and

99
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:37,734
create split for document.

100
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:42,978
For this I create the function PDF text around

101
00:07:43,026 --> 00:07:46,714
this this function get

102
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:50,934
a PDF and split for docs

103
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:54,550
schemas okay I am

104
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:59,350
using the leaderpress PDF I run this I

105
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:04,862
have a first document is

106
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:09,014
here okay this

107
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:13,194
function get the content and send for kidrange cloud

108
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:17,554
I am set URL API key

109
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:22,332
collection name aimed if

110
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:26,300
I run this one time

111
00:08:26,412 --> 00:08:30,184
and save one time if I run this

112
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:34,944
two time the save two time okay

113
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,956
for use with PDF text

114
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,543
and save in my store when

115
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,135
I release this message send this doc

116
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:53,639
for credential after this I

117
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:58,415
can use for carries I

118
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:03,903
run this and output it is how

119
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,519
I can search without

120
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:11,820
save again I create a new method I

121
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:15,668
remove this called store add

122
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:19,544
document so I create query

123
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:23,704
send for credit and get results.

124
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:28,284
My new method is here has star this

125
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:32,064
method not have add document so

126
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:38,760
here I can I

127
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:42,404
have the I can add documents

128
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:47,144
because I have added documents okay in

129
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:51,400
next function I

130
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:55,952
remove disclose so disclose

131
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:59,800
I get to only hidden instance and

132
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:09,624
return my vector store release then

133
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:13,912
my full code for this verizon

134
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:18,204
line shango version is 10

135
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:22,444
you need set model don't

136
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:26,928
use default model don't use MSD

137
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:31,146
default model because in this version having

138
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,762
default values I create a

139
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:38,522
new OpenAI I create my

140
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:42,786
new ember so apnei can't

141
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,810
have it. If I use any video I

142
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:51,266
can't use this I set my vector

143
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,118
star square this seven use

144
00:10:56,246 --> 00:11:01,830
new function has stored because I

145
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,206
don't want to send again the

146
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,234
doc for quadrant I need only vectorstore

147
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:14,574
instance so my search

148
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:17,914
card what is sbn book

149
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:23,970
and send this for kidrant I

150
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:27,778
get this docs and use

151
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:31,778
agents for send if

152
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:36,226
my prompts for agent initialize alum

153
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,642
new and use agent conversation react

154
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:44,454
description my context exam

155
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:48,864
and I get h docs

156
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:53,340
and add in my context. My prompt is very simple,

157
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:56,184
my context regression.

158
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:02,444
I use my temperature zero dot h and

159
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:05,384
use chains for ROM.

160
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:18,704
Run this and

161
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:23,160
my response is the ESPN number

162
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:26,808
is here. Very simple,

163
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:30,328
very easy. Thank you for watching. I see

164
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:30,624
you next.
