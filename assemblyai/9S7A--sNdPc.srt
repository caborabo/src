00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:31,014
Hello, my name is Pina Resnick. I'm CEO and co founder of Resing.

2
00:00:31,134 --> 00:00:34,350
We are a startup and building carbon reduction platform.

3
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:37,118
And today I'm going to talk about carbon reduction,

4
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:41,554
carbon reduction in context of it and SRI specifically.

5
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:45,670
First question, how bad are bananas? Now that very interesting

6
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:49,854
book, I really recommend reading it about all the different emissions coming from

7
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:54,310
carbon footprint, coming from different things. Since this is not an interactive

8
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:57,910
presentation, so I'll just keep it in mind and I'll answer

9
00:00:57,942 --> 00:01:01,286
this question. Is this all climate change?

10
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,710
It's the real thing, right? It's a stark question,

11
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:08,166
although at this point it's answered thousand

12
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,142
times. There is a consensus among scientists

13
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,686
that the climate is changing. There is tons and tons

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,382
of research and generally there is an agreement that if

15
00:01:19,518 --> 00:01:22,726
the temperature is changing, it will be really bad.

16
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,998
And farther it goes, worse it will become.

17
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,566
Right now the temperature increases about 1% or so,

18
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,774
but if it will get to, let's say 8%, not percent,

19
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:36,806
degrees celsius, if it gets to 4% it

20
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,614
will be really bad. And if it gets to 8%, it would be

21
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:44,118
properly terrible. And as we can expect,

22
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:48,230
the richer countries or bigger, or countries with more industries and

23
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:51,824
more cars and stuff, they emit more. So you can

24
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:54,952
see that Europe, US and others, they actually emit more.

25
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:58,844
But now China and India and others are coming

26
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:03,640
as expected and join in the trend. A somewhat

27
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:07,120
optimistic parameter is that actually the

28
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:11,320
rich countries like US and European Union and others,

29
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:15,264
they are actually significantly reducing their emissions

30
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:18,676
for already quite a few years, for a couple of decades, the emissions

31
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,544
in US and Europe and other countries are going down

32
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:26,436
optimistic. But it's not good enough because

33
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,052
other countries like India and China are growing.

34
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:33,084
And that's why overall the world is still emitting

35
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:36,620
more and more carbon equivalents, which is

36
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:40,064
in total about 56 billion tons a year.

37
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:45,114
An interesting thing is that you can see COVID in

38
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:49,150
2020 when we stopped traveling

39
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:53,390
effectively entirely, and that had effective about 5% reduction

40
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:57,294
in carbon emissions. But a year later we picked it up

41
00:02:57,454 --> 00:03:02,166
like it never happened. So we are still emitting more than before. COVID what

42
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,830
the governments are doing, actually some of the governments

43
00:03:05,862 --> 00:03:09,294
doing a lot, specifically more than anyone, is EU

44
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:13,104
and UK and some of the. And some of us.

45
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:16,820
And the biggest agreement that we had

46
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:20,024
was in 2015 in Paris, climate agreement.

47
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:23,812
That's the commitment of the entire world.

48
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:28,116
Most of the countries is to keep the climate change below 1.5%.

49
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,092
And there's a bunch of other things that the governments are investing in, like sustainability,

50
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:35,948
development goals and ESG. Those are different things. Each one has

51
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:39,400
an element of climate change control, but they

52
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:42,984
go beyond that. It also about poverty and clean water

53
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:46,688
and food and all kind of things. And also ESG is also

54
00:03:46,736 --> 00:03:50,408
about social and governance. So those are different things,

55
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:54,640
not just the environmental change. And also the environmental change also goes

56
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:58,720
into things like plastics and other things that are bad for

57
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:02,288
us but not for the climate. So there's quite a lot of things

58
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:06,254
and there's quite a lot of confusion, but generally there's a lot of regulation

59
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:09,954
coming from the governments. A very specific piece of

60
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:13,626
regulation that is probably the most relevant for us here in Europe is EU green

61
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,834
deal and specifically fit for 55, which is a commitment

62
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:21,570
of EU all you countries to reduce carbon emissions by 55%

63
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:25,314
by 2030, which will lead to massive

64
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:28,814
demand on everyone in new emissions.

65
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:32,946
That's the reporting part, which is called CSRD,

66
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,290
which is now a requirement for major enterprises and

67
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:39,426
gradually will become requirements for everyone. And of

68
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,138
course, you can imagine that carbon emissions reporting is only

69
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:46,714
for step towards actual reduction. Who needs the reporting?

70
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:50,002
Who needs the numbers? Unless this is just the first step,

71
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:53,738
it's just a baseline so we can set the reduction targets

72
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:57,298
and then we will find on those who didn't

73
00:04:57,346 --> 00:05:01,800
actually reduce fast enough or carbon taxes to actually increase

74
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:05,208
the cost of services and products that

75
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:08,824
are carbon breach or emitting more emissions.

76
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:12,896
We can expect significant increase in cost of

77
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,044
not reducing carbon emissions. Let's try to understand a bit more.

78
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:20,324
What are carbon emissions in it, where they come from?

79
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:24,672
Generally IT industry is not really something

80
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:29,014
people talk about, but actually IT industry needs more carbon

81
00:05:29,054 --> 00:05:31,714
equivalent gases than airwand industry,

82
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:35,574
which is surprising because airwand industry is everywhere in

83
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:39,278
all the news. But actually currently the IT industry emits about

84
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:43,430
three to 5% of total gases, carbon equivalent gases,

85
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:46,886
and it's expected to grow all the way to 14% in

86
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,594
2040. If we do nothing about that,

87
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:53,646
because of AI and cloud, and effectively

88
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,998
it becomes and central part of

89
00:05:57,046 --> 00:06:00,590
any other industry. There is almost no industry today that is not using

90
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:04,342
significant amount of ag. So we will need to reduce,

91
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:07,982
like I said earlier, we need to reduce by 50%, 50 55%

92
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,470
within six years and by 90% within 25

93
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:15,342
years, while double going and

94
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:19,994
delivering ten or hundred times more it services.

95
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:24,320
This kind of challenge of do more with less is quite

96
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:28,064
a big problem. And the emissions are generally divided into three

97
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:32,128
scopes. The scope one is actually burning things that pre carbon emissions,

98
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:36,208
like fuel in the car or when the cement is produced,

99
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:39,968
or steel. There is also direct carbon emissions and then there is indirect

100
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:44,244
scope to through the electricity, and then somebody else is producing electricity

101
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,982
emitting those gases. And scope three is through indirect consumption.

102
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,434
Consumption of services are good. For example, I buy cloud services

103
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:58,198
from Amazon or Google or AWS

104
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:02,158
or Microsoft. They give me compute

105
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:06,222
services and they do all this scope one and two, and that becomes

106
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:09,614
my scope three. And when we measure, so when we report

107
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:14,046
on scope, on carbon emissions, we need to report on all three scopes.

108
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,382
And when we reduce the emissions, we need to reduce on all three scopes,

109
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:21,902
obviously, because what's the point? Yeah, what's the point of reducing

110
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:26,102
one but not the others? Actually, there is a point, but it's not

111
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:30,558
all of it. And we need to remember that my

112
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:33,814
scope one and two is somebody else's scope three.

113
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:37,182
So if I produce emissions, I'm not

114
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:40,582
doing it for myself. I'm doing it to generate certain goods and services

115
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:44,096
I sell to somebody else and not become scope three emissions for

116
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,344
them. And the regulation is going into direction that everyone should

117
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,872
report everything. It means that we will need to report very

118
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:55,120
detailed, very accurate, both real time emissions to

119
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:59,112
our customers, and we will need to collect from our supply chain. And it

120
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:02,696
will be more like the nutrition value on the food, but it needs to be

121
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,192
very accurate. It also needs to be detailed in real

122
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:10,152
time so we can actually act on it. If it's not real

123
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,324
time and it comes once a month or something like that, it's,

124
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:17,260
it's not something you can use if there is no feedback loop, it's not something

125
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:20,664
we can use to actually take actions and see the result.

126
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:24,652
So what we really need from our software service or

127
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:27,508
it service providers, we need them to report everything.

128
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:31,516
And when I say everything, it needs to be not just the electricity they are

129
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,076
consuming, but also embodied carbon in their hardware,

130
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,824
but also the buildings, and also the cooling and heating and also

131
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:43,296
everything else, all the emissions that they produce while they're

132
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,504
generating the services for us that needs to be attributed to

133
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:51,936
us. And then we can then calculate that and then send

134
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,344
it over to our consumers and to collect

135
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:59,032
all this together. The Green Software foundation created

136
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:02,792
software carbon intensity specification. Greensoftware foundation is a

137
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:07,240
nonprofit organization actually promoting

138
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:11,088
green software. Right. Green culture, practices of sustainability. And it.

139
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:14,696
The general idea of SCI is that there are four things.

140
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,264
Here is e, which is energy consumed by piece of software.

141
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:20,992
So when you run, you use cpu, ram,

142
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:24,448
networking, storage and other things. So it needs

143
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:27,640
energy, right? So that's the e. And we need to calculate

144
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:30,844
the energy very precisely for that specific application.

145
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:34,756
Then there is carbon emitted perfume. So basically,

146
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,284
carbon intensity in the grid, we are consuming energy,

147
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,108
which depends on the grid intensity. So in Poland, for example,

148
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:45,924
80% is coal, in Germany is 50%, and in

149
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:49,304
Norway and Sweden, almost entirely green energy.

150
00:09:50,204 --> 00:09:53,564
M is the carbon emitted during production

151
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:57,004
of the hardware. So the embodied carving, and that's

152
00:09:57,044 --> 00:10:00,444
per r, per unit of calculation. For example,

153
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:04,640
a call to API or a tweet or some sort of

154
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:08,104
calculation. So when I do that, I need to know for each of those

155
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:11,800
calculations how much carbon emitted specifically for that

156
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:15,136
calculation. And then that parameter is

157
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,160
called wrong ways to do, to reduce emissions or

158
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:22,560
not reduce emissions. The first one is greenwashing,

159
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:25,762
which is basically talking about reducing emissions but not doing.

160
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:29,446
A lot of companies are doing it, but generally governments

161
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,206
really don't like it because it actually doesn't do anything. It's all

162
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,862
about talking, not doing.

163
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:41,154
It's about pretending and hiding from responsibility.

164
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:45,414
You can find many different ways to do that. You can read more

165
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:49,366
online if you are interested. But there is so many ways

166
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,914
to hide emissions and pretend like it's okay.

167
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:56,778
And generally, governments are introducing more and more directives

168
00:10:56,826 --> 00:11:00,370
and rules about eliminating that. So recently, a few

169
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:04,826
weeks ago, EU released new directive against greenwashing.

170
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,694
So you can just say that you agree you actually need to prove it.

171
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:13,334
And they're finding the law for different bad things companies did

172
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:17,374
to do it wrong is carbon offsets, and they're not always wrong.

173
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:21,388
Carbon offset is when you buy, when you continue

174
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:25,060
generating carbon emissions. But you buy offset, so you offset,

175
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:28,668
you buy something that actually reduces carbon emissions. For example,

176
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:32,540
somebody who plants trees or does others or

177
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:36,188
captures the carbon and you pay them to do that.

178
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:40,316
So you can put it in your accounting and pretend that you didn't emit those,

179
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,748
those gases. Most of them are not

180
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:48,016
real. Right. Really recommend to watch this very

181
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,648
funny dialogue by John Oliver. It's about 25

182
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:56,064
or something minutes and it's actually explains the carbon

183
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:59,920
offsets very well and it's very fun. So the other thing

184
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,280
is follow the sun. This is like in support. When we

185
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:07,120
have people around the globe they can support during the

186
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:10,784
day, right? So around the sun, yeah. Similar principle

187
00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:14,190
is when there is sun, obviously there is more sun energy.

188
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:17,714
So more greener energy mix becomes greener.

189
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:21,650
So theoretically we can relocate our loads around different countries

190
00:12:21,722 --> 00:12:24,882
and then enjoy the benefits of green or

191
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:28,498
basically carbon awareness. So greener energy mix,

192
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,898
but it's not always value, but it's always really

193
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:35,170
helping us because first it's very, it's not that easy to actually relocate

194
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:38,586
services. It's quite a lot of work and we need to consider how much

195
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,828
emissions we're going to generate while we actually

196
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:45,636
doing this work. Then potentially we need capacity in

197
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,836
different regions, and then there's embodied carbon and idle

198
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,772
energy consumption. So potentially it may not even reduce the emissions.

199
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:57,396
And then when we relocate to green areas, if everyone is

200
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,700
relocating to Norway, maybe it

201
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:04,036
will be okay for everyone, but then potentially the

202
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,876
cost of the services in Norway will go up because everyone

203
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,060
wants to be there to be greener. But then either it will be more expensive

204
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:15,596
or Norway will not be

205
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,428
able to generate green energy, sufficient amount of green energy, and they will start

206
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:22,620
doing non green energy. So they're all different difficult

207
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:25,988
questions to ask. But this strategy is

208
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:29,316
not bad per se, but it's not.

209
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,788
If you're not optimizing and just going after greener

210
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:36,776
energy, you're ignoring embodied carbon and all

211
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,304
kind of other things. That strategy, but it's not

212
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:44,320
automatically a good strategy. So what should we do then?

213
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:47,792
First, there's three major elements in this.

214
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:50,920
All we can divide work into three major areas.

215
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:54,964
One is energy efficiency, so basically, how we use less energy

216
00:13:55,824 --> 00:13:59,684
do our work, applications are running.

217
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,350
Second is hardware efficiency. So how we reduce the amount

218
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:07,414
of hardware to reduce the embodied carbon in that hardware. And the

219
00:14:07,454 --> 00:14:11,022
third is carbon awareness. That's the migrating to after

220
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:14,206
greener energy, migrating our loads after

221
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,542
greener energy. And not all of

222
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:20,838
it should come, must come in the same time.

223
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:25,238
So we cannot expect to just jump into being

224
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:28,966
awesome and cream overnight. So it's a

225
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,606
process. And although we need to act dramatically

226
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,914
faster than we are doing now, there's still,

227
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:40,054
it's impossible to do it overnight. But this is a great

228
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,678
project also by grant software foundation maturity Matrix,

229
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:47,118
which basically shows that it's a process of maturing.

230
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:51,034
So there's quite a lot of things we can start with and then gradually

231
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:55,294
improve over time. And the things that I would recommend

232
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:58,646
doing now immediately, is organizational, is about

233
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,030
acquiring knowledge and convincing the management to invest in this

234
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:05,654
and these kind of things, and make it critical,

235
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:08,998
strategic. And the second is collecting information,

236
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:12,182
because in our experience, most companies don't really

237
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:15,870
collect data about carbon emissions, or don't even know how

238
00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:20,288
to collect the data. How it all connects to and

239
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,644
why SRE could be very valuable and helpful to actually achieve those goals

240
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:29,296
is if we look into SRE, what's the actual purpose of it is

241
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,164
the slight balance between the speed and reliability.

242
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:36,816
And nowhere mentioned anything about sustainability.

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,632
But yes, there is continuous improvement of

244
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:44,608
reliability of the software and also of

245
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:48,494
productivity of the developers, but the sustainability is not

246
00:15:48,534 --> 00:15:51,734
part of it. And we know that when we look into

247
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:55,654
Sre, there's these four golden signals that are typically used to

248
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:59,502
measure the SLE, the SLos

249
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:03,374
and SLA's and Slis. They are almost based on latency,

250
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:06,806
traffic errors and saturation. Those are

251
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,350
the key elements, key golden signals, and they don't actually

252
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:13,700
reflecting the sustainability. Right. So what we would

253
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:17,452
recommend is to start using the fifth golden signal,

254
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:21,148
which is SCi, the software carbon intensity,

255
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:25,356
which I explained earlier. It is not so easy to

256
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,436
calculate right now, but it's generally not.

257
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,036
It's a very precise metric that can be calculated for each piece of

258
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,004
software. It's the energy consumed by the applications

259
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:39,542
multiplied by the energy mix in the grid, plus the

260
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:42,678
embodied carbon per unit of calculation.

261
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:46,806
And if we can attach to every single piece of application,

262
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,758
we can attach the SCI. We can also start measuring

263
00:16:50,806 --> 00:16:55,034
and improving on it, in addition to those four other metrics,

264
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:59,758
then it's very important to change our objectives,

265
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:04,294
not just from speed of development and resilience

266
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:08,254
of the application. So reliability of the applications, but also

267
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,254
to keep our planet healthy, right. We have to keep

268
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:17,074
reducing our emissions and we have to measure an SRE is positioned

269
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:20,914
in precise place where they can have

270
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:24,930
immediate impact. So if we can define the carbon

271
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,894
emissions as the objective,

272
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:31,370
then we can define SLA's and SLis

273
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:35,822
in the terms of carbon intensity. And we

274
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:39,310
can continuously measure emissions and

275
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:42,814
then identify the anti patterns and reduce them. And the same

276
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:46,998
as we would do with reliability metrics, we would systematically

277
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:50,382
identify the waste and emissions and then would

278
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:54,806
systematically reduce them. I already said that aspect measurements

279
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,198
are very difficult, but there are some measurement tools that can

280
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:01,798
help, and that's the beginning. And we expect those tools to expand

281
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:05,272
the new tools to appear. An example is Kubernetes

282
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:08,632
Kepler. So Kepler, which is a tool that is managing,

283
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:12,844
it's connecting information about energy consumption within Kubernetes

284
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:15,584
and export it through Prometheus.

285
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:19,440
So it's not exactly showing the carbon emissions, but it

286
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:23,072
shows the energy consumed based on different physics,

287
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,512
which is much more accurate and much more definitely real

288
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:31,012
time. And it can be integrated with graphamin and normal monitoring

289
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:34,852
systems. You can actually see the energy consumed

290
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:38,064
by applications within your clusters.

291
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,172
Another one is scaffolder, which is also

292
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:45,972
which is focusing on mostly on the bare

293
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:49,316
metal and hardware through the kernel codes. There are all kind

294
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,060
of details you can find scafander. Both of them are open source projects, and both

295
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:56,644
of them are somewhat advanced, but not yet

296
00:18:56,724 --> 00:19:00,012
covering everything. In Vasync, we are working on a

297
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:04,064
project called ether, which is carbon observability platform.

298
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:07,452
Sorry. It's carbon observability tool that also

299
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:11,300
integrates with Kepler, but also directly looks into virtual

300
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:14,932
machines and other things in the cloud and on Prem. And it

301
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:19,196
can generate detailed view on energy

302
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,780
consumed and embodied carbon emissions

303
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:26,440
and all converted into carbon emissions based on

304
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:30,440
the actual energy grid. So we're also going and checking with tools

305
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:33,544
like energy mach to understand the current

306
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:37,424
energy mix in the grid. So in any given moment. So this

307
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:40,672
way we can collect information in real time,

308
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:44,964
accurate detail and real time information about carbon emissions,

309
00:19:45,624 --> 00:19:49,064
different it systems on Prem and the cloud, and then show it to

310
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:53,142
the users. This one is also open source. You can go to GitHub and

311
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:56,642
encourage you to give it a star and continue

312
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:00,026
to ask questions. The next level of

313
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,282
tooling is profiling. So there are quite few different

314
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:06,690
profiling tools that also can. So there is a

315
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:11,026
way to convert effectively every line of

316
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,714
code into energy consumption, and then again converts it to carbon

317
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:18,610
emissions. And you can find those two really good talks,

318
00:20:18,642 --> 00:20:21,496
one by Ng and one by Firefox.

319
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,796
So you can see this presentation and the

320
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,684
links will be available in the presentation. But those talks

321
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:33,180
are going into detail of really debugging or profiling the application

322
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:37,292
line by line, and seeing each line, how much emissions it produce,

323
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:41,264
and then figuring out which algorithms or way of coding or

324
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:45,344
different data structures, how they affect sustainability.

325
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:49,240
Of course there is different programming languages.

326
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:52,816
Each one of them is different. Some, obviously the interpreted ones,

327
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,000
are heavier than compiled ones. This is

328
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:59,336
not very up to date, but it's

329
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,640
not just about languages, but it's also about different tools like

330
00:21:02,672 --> 00:21:06,808
databases and everything else. So each one of them would have different

331
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:12,088
carbon footprint. And if we have a general understanding

332
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:15,552
how much each of the tools in our system contributes

333
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:18,964
to the emissions, then we can start taking actions.

334
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:23,256
So there are many ways to reduce the emissions. There is the

335
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,240
most obvious ones, it's just reduce waste. So kill the zombies,

336
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:31,008
descale your clusters, they just shut down

337
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:35,120
things that you're not using. Some of the clouds are greener than on prem,

338
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:39,088
or maybe the other way around. It depends. It needs to be measured. But there

339
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:42,844
are many ways to improve the energy consumption. On energy mix.

340
00:21:43,574 --> 00:21:47,214
Auto scaling is always very important because otherwise

341
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:50,874
we tend to over provision and then just run unneeded resources.

342
00:21:51,174 --> 00:21:55,198
There is a big difference between x 86 and our own

343
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:59,198
energy concern. And those are just examples of

344
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:02,734
different patterns that can be quite easily improved.

345
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:06,526
For example, we say if you have in the same cluster,

346
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,954
very stable load, with some spiky

347
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:12,974
cron jobs or some white cron jobs,

348
00:22:13,094 --> 00:22:16,574
then those things could be separated and run

349
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:20,382
in different ways, or there are different strategies to

350
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:24,046
deal with it. But basically if you separate the loads, or if

351
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,494
you pre provision or dynamically provision the hardware for those

352
00:22:27,534 --> 00:22:30,798
spikes, you can often reduce the size of a

353
00:22:30,806 --> 00:22:34,110
cluster, sometimes by 50%, with no

354
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:37,874
impact on the actual applications. We need to

355
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:41,742
make sure that we only request the needed amount of resources.

356
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:46,062
CPU and RAM are the most energy consuming components.

357
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,622
We need to make sure we don't request more than we need. There are all

358
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:52,634
kinds of different things to optimize, like container images,

359
00:22:53,174 --> 00:22:57,294
jvm settings, not to grab too much memory, not to build massive

360
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,630
images. All of that translates into more energy

361
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:04,240
consumption, which translates to more carbon emissions.

362
00:23:04,392 --> 00:23:08,624
What we see often that people deploy too many test environments.

363
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:12,016
I understand this is very. This is what continuous delivery and

364
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,592
continuous integration require. But actually it's not,

365
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:19,800
right? So if you provision an environment on each pr, on each commit,

366
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:23,084
and you don't really use or on tests on it, then what's the point?

367
00:23:23,624 --> 00:23:27,800
And maybe it doesn't cost you much because you already pre committed

368
00:23:27,832 --> 00:23:31,298
to those servers, but it still consumes

369
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:34,970
energy. And if you provision those things, yeah, you're just emitting

370
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:38,814
more current. Or another example is if your

371
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:42,986
business doesn't require higher availability, don't do

372
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:47,018
it. Because that will mean not just additional cost but also additional emissions.

373
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:50,162
Right? It means more is more redundancy,

374
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:53,614
more different zones, all kind of different things.

375
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:58,096
And there is different tools, different databases, some of

376
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,456
them are heavier than others. Do you really need something like

377
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,976
Cassandra? If you can manage with a small postgres and

378
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,608
stuff? It very much depends on the use cases

379
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:12,552
and there's a lot more. And also there is strengths in paging

380
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:16,216
software foundation, also quite useful. And we always seem

381
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,424
to remember it's not just about energy consumption, it's also about embodied

382
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:25,832
carbon. This is an example of a Dell server which is over 7000

383
00:24:25,888 --> 00:24:29,404
tons of emissions over the course of their life.

384
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,936
It's emitted before it actually was sold, right? So it's

385
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,144
the embodied carbon which when you buy the server, it's already emitted.

386
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,656
Now the question for how long you will keep it? You keep

387
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,830
it for four years, then it's one and a

388
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:46,668
half tons a year. If you keep it for ten years,

389
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,228
it's 700 kilogram per year. It's a big

390
00:24:50,276 --> 00:24:53,332
difference. And generally it also costs you money to

391
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:56,932
buy new servers. Of course there's also a bit of balance.

392
00:24:56,988 --> 00:25:00,064
Like newer servers are a bit more energy efficient.

393
00:25:00,484 --> 00:25:04,236
So it's still not black and white. We need to understand in

394
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,580
detail the energy consumption and budget carbon, and then make

395
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:10,812
the decisions based on combination. So in this case,

396
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:14,714
about 17% of lifestyle emissions

397
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:18,474
will be from embodied carbon in case of this specific server

398
00:25:18,554 --> 00:25:21,402
on average. And another example,

399
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:25,410
Amazon recently decided to extend the lifespan of their service to

400
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:29,186
six years. And that saved them not just a lot of emissions,

401
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,734
but also $900 million. In our experience,

402
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:37,034
we can expect quite reasonably easily reduce

403
00:25:37,074 --> 00:25:40,714
the emissions by at least 50% just

404
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:44,394
by fixing infrastructure waste, removing infrastructure

405
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:48,034
waste, and then potentially another 20 30% by

406
00:25:48,074 --> 00:25:51,378
optimizing the software, which is. And then more,

407
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:55,554
by using more efficient tooling and replacing them with

408
00:25:55,714 --> 00:25:59,242
less resource intense tools. That's about

409
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:02,682
it. Just answering the questions about the question

410
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:06,400
about the bananas. The bananas are actually not very bad.

411
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,836
Bananas are at single banana average. It depends

412
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,348
if it was flying or not. There are all kind of different considerations, but generates

413
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:17,196
about 110 grams of CO2 each a

414
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,860
spoon bowl. Bananas are not that bad. Couple other

415
00:26:20,892 --> 00:26:25,292
examples. So an email, it goes from 0.3

416
00:26:25,348 --> 00:26:28,564
grams on a spam email that no one opens. It is

417
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:32,278
still a bit of emissions, because there is brick sending and stuff

418
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:36,134
all the way up to 26 grants. If you send it to,

419
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:39,802
it takes you ten minutes to write some screen time, and you send

420
00:26:39,818 --> 00:26:43,602
it to 100 people and they open it and they

421
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:47,338
look at it for 3 seconds. So again, all the servers around

422
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:50,746
and screen time and everything, it means that when

423
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:55,130
you send things to more people, then you produce, generate more missions.

424
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,482
So you need to consider, every time you do things, there is impact, especially if

425
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:02,814
you do it on scale. A typical laptop and

426
00:27:02,894 --> 00:27:06,462
actually laptop or a phone.

427
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,254
So both of them generate about. Actually both of them both.

428
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:13,990
83 84% of emissions on average would

429
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:17,234
be embodied emissions and not energy consumed.

430
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:21,430
So the energy is actually only 15% and then

431
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:25,206
only 2%. And the services around the Gmail and

432
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:30,486
networking and whatever is about 15% is

433
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,566
an interesting thing. So people think there is

434
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,998
no emission, but actually there is embodied emissions in the bike

435
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:40,358
itself. And also we, when we bike,

436
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:43,774
we expand, we use our own energy. So if we bananas,

437
00:27:43,814 --> 00:27:46,994
it's 40 grams/mile

438
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:51,318
how much? 4.7 kilogram air

439
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:54,710
freighted asparaguses. Right? So that's how

440
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:57,834
much energy we expand to go a mile on the bike.

441
00:27:58,294 --> 00:28:02,134
If we compensate it with elephant sporagosis, that's that

442
00:28:02,174 --> 00:28:05,194
much. 4.6 hundred times more.

443
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:09,006
It basically shows that asparaguses are

444
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,038
the worst. Generally speaking, beef is the worst

445
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:16,990
meat. And then in terms of emissions, and then

446
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:20,298
one, and then chicken, and generally

447
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:24,818
the grown food is less impactful cryptocurrencies

448
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:28,546
is a big deal. They are 0.12%

449
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,498
of total world carbon emissions and it doesn't sound a

450
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:36,794
lot, but actually considering that this is not really essential,

451
00:28:36,874 --> 00:28:40,434
like all this cryptocurrency mining is

452
00:28:40,474 --> 00:28:44,346
quite stupid way to create. I'm not expressing

453
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,618
my opinion about cryptocurrency or blockchain technologies,

454
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:50,770
but in general we are wasting a lot of money,

455
00:28:50,922 --> 00:28:54,054
resources and generating a lot of emissions.

456
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:58,218
Cloud altogether is about quarter

457
00:28:58,266 --> 00:29:02,522
of a percent. It's 1% of global electricity and quarter percent of total

458
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:05,970
carbon footprint and in

459
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:09,494
total is 1.4

460
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:13,138
billion tons. Right. So it's three to 5%.

461
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:17,150
Depends how we can grow. And I actually

462
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:20,718
recommend you to read these books. There's how bad are bananas?

463
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:24,366
Really good book. To get a feeling how the carbon

464
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,006
footprint is calculated. The best and probably the only

465
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,358
technical book around green software is by Ann

466
00:29:31,446 --> 00:29:34,974
Sara and Sara building green software. It's a great book.

467
00:29:35,014 --> 00:29:39,062
It was released just a few weeks ago and then the other books are pilgrim

468
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:43,090
still probably the best book on high level and not

469
00:29:43,122 --> 00:29:47,226
the end of the world. I really recommend you if you want to have optimistic

470
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,098
and realistic feel. And the last one is just an interesting one.

471
00:29:51,146 --> 00:29:54,386
It's not very easy about. You'll see.

472
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,134
Look into it. It's an interesting one, but not like the others.

473
00:29:58,794 --> 00:30:02,362
Thank you for listening. And the last thing I would say is

474
00:30:02,378 --> 00:30:06,362
that if you think what's next? What can I do next? I would recommend you

475
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:09,980
to read the building green software. I think that's an excellent book

476
00:30:10,012 --> 00:30:13,924
that will give you a good overview of on the technical level and

477
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:18,316
start measuring. Try to at least roughly understand what

478
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,784
are the emissions generated by your systems.

479
00:30:22,284 --> 00:30:26,028
Thank you and please get in touch if you have more questions.

480
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:26,484
Okay.
