00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,228
Hello everyone, welcome to my talk on mastering cloud security automation

2
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:31,164
using Terraform and chef as integration tool.

3
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:35,376
Terraform is one of the best products that I've used for infrastructure as a

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,520
code which helped me build a lot of infrastructure

5
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:41,644
in AWS, Google, Chronicle,

6
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:44,244
tribble as well as splunk cloud.

7
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:48,976
Like to talk more of my expertise and my experience in using Terraform

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,400
and chef and also how did it help the cloud security

9
00:00:52,472 --> 00:00:55,580
automation and I would like to share like

10
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:58,780
we have a lineup of topics that I would like to discuss starting

11
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:02,780
with introduction and what is Terraform and chef benefits

12
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,404
of automating cloud security with Terraform,

13
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:09,124
integration of strategies for terraform and chef security

14
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:12,876
best practices with Terraform and a real world case study.

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,044
The future trends, challenges and key takeaways introduction

16
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:21,180
so cloud computing automation is on the rise,

17
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:25,008
but security remains a critical concern. Manual security

18
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:28,336
configurations are prone to human error and inconsistencies,

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,968
so automation of security infrastructure deployment is

20
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:35,736
essential for consistent and efficient security practices.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,176
The presentation explores more on integrating terraform and

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,404
chef for automating cloud security infrastructure.

23
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:46,792
Terraform is one of very good product, I can

24
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:50,404
say a beautiful product for open source infrastructure as a code.

25
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:56,446
Been using this for almost eight years. And the

26
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,254
best part of Terraform is, you know, you can scale up,

27
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:02,994
expand, destroy,

28
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:07,234
deploy configurations, everything in a matter of less than two minutes,

29
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:12,606
let it be in Toronto or let it be in AWS or data lake or

30
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,148
splunk cloud chef on the other hand is is

31
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:20,264
a master tool for automation and deployment.

32
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:24,604
Like conflict management platform for automated infrastructure

33
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:28,304
configuration and deployment. Both tools enable automation,

34
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:32,024
vision control and collaboration for infrastructure management.

35
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:37,388
So benefits of automating cloud security. So first

36
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:40,996
is consistency security configurations across all

37
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,980
the cloud environments you may have a huge infrastructure globally,

38
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:48,734
say like Asia Pacific, Europe or

39
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:52,010
you know in America.

40
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:55,298
So having automation

41
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:59,762
tool handle these environments is first enables consistency

42
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:03,426
and the sanity of all the configurations is up in the

43
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,970
repo and also reduce the risk of human error and misconfigurations.

44
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:11,490
Improved compliance and other ends to security best practices,

45
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:15,896
faster deployment and scaling of security infrastructure and

46
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,288
increased efficiency and productivity for IT teams,

47
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:23,448
especially for cloud security. We have the Cert teams,

48
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:27,016
we have the sort teams, we have the security compliance, we have the global

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,964
compliance teams. So everyone using having

50
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:37,044
like an access to a global environment is

51
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:41,600
as crucial as having the cloud security automation

52
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:45,632
in the best practice. So integration

53
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:49,208
strategies for terraform and chef. So terraform is

54
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,928
mainly used for provisioning cloud resources. Example like virtual machines,

55
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:56,336
VPN, VPC, transit gateways,

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,204
networks and storage and EBS volumes.

57
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:03,920
We can define the entire architecture

58
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,584
of an infrastructure of a server in terraform saying that hey, I want

59
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:10,824
like for example if you take an AWS instance, you can say

60
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:14,232
that I would like to have, maybe I would like

61
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:18,288
to have a EC two instance with so and so volume with maybe

62
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:22,524
two, two gates, three gates and however you want to have the EBS

63
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:26,312
storage volume also terraform provision set.

64
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:29,720
Chef on the other hand is for configuring and managing the

65
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:33,200
provision resources. Like for example installing security

66
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:36,484
software, configuring firewalls, push in confets,

67
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:39,886
maybe LDAP roles and also a

68
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,974
lot of infrastructure for you know ad

69
00:04:44,014 --> 00:04:47,734
groups as well. Leveraging terraform provider

70
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:51,314
ecosystem and chefs could put repositories

71
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:55,718
and also automating the entire splunt, the security

72
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:57,874
infrastructure lifestyle that we have.

73
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:03,006
Security best practices with terraform and chef. So implementing infrastructure

74
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,998
as a core principles for security configurations, enabling version control

75
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:11,044
for audit trails and security automating, security hardening

76
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:14,900
and patches for processes and also integrating security scanning and

77
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:17,104
compliance chains in the automation pipeline.

78
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:21,092
So say that we have a large enterprise with

79
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:24,184
a hybrid cloud environment challenge,

80
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:28,956
ensuring consistent security configuration across multiple providers.

81
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,092
So in this example, let's say that we have a hybrid cloud

82
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:36,344
environment in US,

83
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:40,206
in Europe, in Australia, New Zealand and Asia.

84
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,622
So having in

85
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:46,950
a hybrid infrastructure, what you have is for anything for the servers that are on

86
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:50,734
Prem chef is enabled. So any configuration that you want to push

87
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:54,166
to the server based in New Zealand or Europe, chef, you know, we do it

88
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,870
with automation using chef and anyone, anything in cloud

89
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:02,374
say AWS or chronicle or splunk cloud tribal etcetera.

90
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:06,282
We use terraform challenge ensuring consistency

91
00:06:06,338 --> 00:06:10,266
security configuration across multiple cloud terraform

92
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,466
for provisional resources where we can provide say that hey in

93
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,794
main TF or in networking

94
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:20,946
TF TF files are the terraform files where we

95
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,994
describe network security groups or resources

96
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:29,134
and chef for configuring security controls.

97
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:32,894
The final results of this is improved security posture,

98
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:36,630
reduced manual effort and faster time to market new services.

99
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:40,622
Say if I want to have a service up in New Zealand and if I

100
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:44,646
have the account ready by the networking team maybe it's

101
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,038
a days work of in building the infrastructure, setting up

102
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:51,834
the VPC network, the transit gateways and also

103
00:06:52,214 --> 00:06:55,758
scaling and you can destroy the instances using

104
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:59,372
terraform all within an hour. So that's

105
00:06:59,388 --> 00:07:02,740
the best way of, you know, giving an example on how

106
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:06,012
terraform can we can use terraform to

107
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:09,788
steal an environment challenges in consideration,

108
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:13,628
not, not like, not on a very mine critical

109
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:17,076
scale. It's just like you know, managing and maintaining infrastructure as code

110
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,204
repositories make sure that all the code is checked in reviewed,

111
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:24,700
peer reviewed, approved and merged and always work

112
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:29,064
off on YouTube. New pull or a new repo and

113
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:32,512
integrating with existing security tools and processes like if you have any security

114
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:35,592
tools that are on Prem, find a

115
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:39,392
way like you know how we can integrate using Terraform or

116
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:42,640
chef and how the apps can be deployed using these and

117
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,964
addressing compliance and regulatory requirements.

118
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:49,064
So if having the Terraform repo made sure

119
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:52,496
that you know it is only accessible to the team that

120
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,240
are the owners of it, but not like across the

121
00:07:56,272 --> 00:07:59,604
or across the company for compliance purposes.

122
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:05,184
Increased adoption of infrastructure as a code and configuration managed tools

123
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:08,280
light of future trends and developments integration with cloud

124
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:12,864
security posture management and cloud workload protection platform shift

125
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:17,232
towards policy as a code and compliance as code approaches advancements

126
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:19,684
in automated security and testing.

127
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:25,316
The key takeaways is automating security infrastructure deployment

128
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,532
is crucial for consistent and efficient security practices.

129
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:33,268
Terraform and chef provide powerful tools for automating cloud security infrastructure

130
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:37,444
integration. Security strategies and security best practices enable organization

131
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:41,268
to enhance their cloud security posture. Real world case

132
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,476
studies demonstrate the benefit of implementing terraform

133
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,374
and chef and

134
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:55,946
integrating terraform and chef for cloud security. Automation is

135
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,082
a powerful approach to ensure consistent, efficient and cloud security infrastructure.

136
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:03,774
This is my conclusion on it and definitely I would

137
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:08,338
recommend people using chef and terraform.

138
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,042
By leveraging infrastructure as a code and configuration

139
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,418
management principles, organizations can reduce definitely

140
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:19,044
human errors and improve compliance and enhance their overall security

141
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:22,356
posture. By embracing tools like Terraform and chef,

142
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,156
organizations can stay ahead of evolving security challenges and maintain a

143
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,504
robust and resilient cloud environment.

144
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:33,908
Thank you for thank you for joining and I hope you

145
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,364
all enjoy the Con 42.
