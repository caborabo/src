00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:34,834
Hi everyone, my name is Tabrez and I am part of the team

2
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:39,114
at Aviatrix that is implementing AI, machine learning and

3
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:42,282
generative AI initiatives. Aviatrix is a

4
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:45,674
multi cloud networking company dedicated to simplifying

5
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:50,106
cloud infrastructure management and security across major cloud providers

6
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,534
including AWS, Azure, GCP and Alibaba.

7
00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:57,994
Trusted by over 500 enterprises worldwide,

8
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:01,394
Aviatrix offers a comprehensive platform that ensures

9
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:05,194
visibility, control and security, enabling businesses

10
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:08,210
to adapt quickly and move forward efficiently.

11
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:11,682
Today, I will be showcasing some of the innovative AI

12
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,786
and ML solutions we've developed to drive efficiency and transformation

13
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,494
within our organization. Let's dive into the detail.

14
00:01:21,564 --> 00:01:25,628
The first initiative I am going to talk about is the network mission

15
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:29,252
briefs for customers. The mission brief integrates real

16
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:32,164
time customer insights from multiple sources,

17
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:36,612
providing a comprehensive 360 degree view of customers.

18
00:01:36,788 --> 00:01:40,708
This initiative empowers the sales team with data driven decision making

19
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:44,348
capabilities, enabling them to close deals more efficiently

20
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:47,932
and maintain a competitive edge. By aggregating data

21
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:51,652
from various platforms, Aviatrix ensures that all relevant

22
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:54,980
customer information is easily accessible, enhancing the

23
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:58,064
overall customer engagement and support processes.

24
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:01,948
The mission briefs utilizes tools such as Coda for document

25
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:05,676
generation, copy AI for AI narratives, and xeno

26
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,332
data lake for data storage. We've generated over 500

27
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:12,764
mission briefs. This initiative has reduced our sales cycle

28
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:16,504
time by 30%, doubled data accessibility speed,

29
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:19,960
and achieved a 95% accuracy in insights,

30
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:23,688
significantly enhancing our sales team's effectiveness. The next

31
00:02:23,736 --> 00:02:27,384
initiative is the lead scoring app. The app leverages

32
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:31,064
AI to streamline the lead qualification process by

33
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:34,804
matching leads with the ideal customer profile or ICP.

34
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:39,280
The app automates data retrieval from various sources and

35
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:42,914
assigns detailed lead scores based on multiple factors,

36
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:45,674
enhancing sales efficiency and precision.

37
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:49,366
By providing a comprehensive view of potential leads,

38
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,350
the app helps prioritize high value prospects, ensuring the

39
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:57,194
sales team can focus their efforts on the most promising opportunities.

40
00:02:58,254 --> 00:03:01,430
Our lead scoring app leverages AI tools like copy AI

41
00:03:01,462 --> 00:03:04,630
for content generation, coda for workflow automation,

42
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:07,814
and Salesforce for CRM. By integrating these

43
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,338
technologies, we score over 5000 leads monthly,

44
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:14,650
resulting in a 25% increase in lead conversion

45
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:18,490
and a 15% boost in sales productivity. The next initiative I'm

46
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:22,522
going to talk about is the AI powered customer support chatbot.

47
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:26,394
The chatbot utilizes AI and machine learning to autonomously

48
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:30,770
handle common customer inquiries and efficiently escalate complex issues.

49
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:34,824
To support teams operating through the Aviatrix support portal,

50
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:38,244
the chatbot integrates with the Zendesk ticketing system,

51
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:42,036
logs tickets automatically, and directs them to the relevant support

52
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,996
tier. This initiative significantly enhances the customer support

53
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,144
experience, ensuring timely and accurate responses to customer queries.

54
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:55,284
The chatbot utilizes copy AI for content automation,

55
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:59,624
intercom for real time chat, and Zendesk for ticket management.

56
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:03,140
By integrating these tools, we achieve 80%

57
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:06,914
automation of common inquiries, reduce response time by

58
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:10,810
60%, and decrease support tickets by 50%.

59
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:14,746
This tech stack significantly enhances our customer support efficiency and

60
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,890
effectiveness. The next featured initiative is implementation of

61
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:22,418
GitHub Copilot at Aviatrix. This initiative revolutionizes

62
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:25,714
code development by leveraging generative AI and

63
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:29,474
machine learning to assist developers. This AI powered

64
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:32,264
tool analyzes developers intents,

65
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:36,972
suggests improvements, automates tasks, and even writes code.

66
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:40,932
This initiative allows developers to focus on more complex aspects

67
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:45,164
of their projects while maintaining a high quality codebase. The GitHub

68
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:49,420
copilot leverages machine learning and generative AI for code completion

69
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:53,404
integrated with visual studio code. By utilizing machine

70
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:56,308
learning models for code analysis and suggestions,

71
00:04:56,436 --> 00:05:00,324
and integrating with our CI CD pipeline, we've increased

72
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:04,348
development speed by 50%, boosted developer productivity

73
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:07,580
by 40%, and contributed 30,000

74
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:11,740
lines of code. This tech stack significantly enhances

75
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:15,468
our development efficiency. The last featured initiative

76
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:19,132
I would like to talk about is present AI. Present AI

77
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:22,636
transforms business communication by leveraging AI to create

78
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,284
engaging and effective presentations. This AI powered

79
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:29,904
platform significantly enhances productivity by automating

80
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:33,000
the creation of slides, ensuring brand compliance,

81
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:35,564
and facilitating visual storytelling.

82
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:38,976
By reducing the time spent on preparing presentations,

83
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,160
present AI allows employees to focus on delivering impactful

84
00:05:43,272 --> 00:05:46,760
and interactive content tailored to the audience's needs.

85
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:51,152
Using present AI, we've achieved a 70% reduction in presentation

86
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,952
preparation time, a two x increase in presentation engagement

87
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:58,774
rates, and a 30% increase in content personalization.

88
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:02,530
This AI powered platform significantly enhances

89
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:06,834
our efficiency and impact in creating engaging, customized presentations.
