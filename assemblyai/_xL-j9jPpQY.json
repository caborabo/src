Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining me today. I am excited to discuss how AI and robotics are revolutionizing product assembly, boosting material recovery by 50%, reducing waste and advance sustainability. To start, lets consider the complexity of modern product. Todays products are incredibly integrated, featuring elaborate designs and a variety of materials. For instance, an average smartphone contains over 60 different elements, including rare earth metals, which are crucial for its functionality but challenging to recycle. This complexity possesses significant challenges for disembly, often leading to resource underutilization. Valuable components are frequently discarded because they are difficult to separate from other materials. This inefficiency results in both economy losses and environmental degradation. When valuable materials are wasted, companies lose potential revenue and we all suffer from increased environmental impact. Inefficient disembly means more waste end up in landfill, contributing to pollution and the depletion of natural resources. Research indicates that up to 80% of a product's environmental impact is determined at the design stage. This static underscores the critical need for efficient assembly methods. If we can reclaim and recycle materials effectively, we can mitigate a significant portion of this impact. Efficient assembly is not just about reducing waste, it's about making the most of the resources we have. For example, think about an electric vehicle battery. These batteries contain valuable materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel. Efficient assembly methods can reclaim these materials for use, reducing the need for mining and the associated environmental impacts. Advanced AI and robotics play pivotal role in achieving this efficiency. By integrating these technologies into disembly processes, we can navigate the complexities of modern product designs with greater precision. Imagine a world where every product can be taken apart easily and every component can be used or recycled. This vision is becoming a reality. With the help of AI and robotics. Let's dive deeper into how AI and robotics are transforming disassembly. Advanced AI, particularly GPT based system, combined with sophisticated vision and haptic sensors, enable robots to disassemble products with remarkable accuracy. These technologies allow us to navigate the complexities of various product designs. For instance, using machine learning algorithm, robots can be trained to recognize different type of screws and fasteners used in electronics, ensuring they can be removed without damaging the components. Traditional disembly method often fail to recover all components which are usable. However, industry they have that have adopted AI in their disembly processors reports a 30% of increase in the retrieval of the usable components. This improvement has a direct impact on waste reduction and material recycling. By recovering more usable components, we reduce the amount of waste that end up in landfills and increase the availability of materials for use. AI powered robots in an e waste recycling facility can sort and separate valuable components like gold, silver, and palladium from old circuit boards, which are then sent for refining and reuse in new electronics. This is a significant step toward a sustainable circular the transformative impact of AI and robotics on disembly processes cannot be overstated. These technologies significantly reduce the environmental footprint of product lifecycle management. Companies that have implemented these technologies report up to a 50% improvement in material recovery rates. This improvement is just not aesthetics it represents real world benefits. For example, by recovering more materials, companies can reduce their reliance on raw material extraction, which is often environmentally damaging. This is particularly important in industries like electronics, where raw material extraction involves environmentally destruction practices like open pit mining and the use of toxic chemicals. Furthermore, improved medical recovery rates lead to more efficient recycling processes. For instance, AI system can analyze and optimize the sorting of different plastic types, ensuring higher purity in recycled plastic materials. This efficiency translates to practical benefit for a sustainable circular economy. We can ensure that material continue to circulate within the economy rather than being lost as waste. Despite these advancement, we still face several challenges in current dissembling practices. One of the biggest challenges is the high rate of resource wastage. Traditional methods of disassembly in recycling are often inefficient, leading to significant material losses. For instance, many products are designed without considering how they will be disassembled. This oversight makes it difficult to separate materials effectively. Additionally, traditional recycling method often involves shredding materials, which can contaminate recyclable components and reduce their quality. For example, shredding an old laptop can mix metals and plastics and making it harder to recover pure materials. AI and robotics present groundbreaking solution to these issues. By automating the disembly process and using AI to guide robots, we can overcome many of the limitations of traditional methods. These technologies allow for more precise and efficient disassembly, reducing waste and improving material recovery. For example, AI algorithm can optimize the disassembly sequence for complex products, ensuring minimal damage and maximum recovery of valuable components. To illustrate this practical application for these technologies, let's look at some case studies. These examples demonstrate how companies have successfully implemented AI and robotics in their dissembling processes. In one case study, a company used air driven robots to disable electronic devices. The robots were able to identify and separate valuable components with high precision, leading to a 40% increase in material recovery. The improvement not only reduced waste, but also provided the company with additional revenue from the recovered material. For instance, the recovered metals were sold back to manufacturers and creating a closed loop supply chain. In another example, a manufacturing company implemented an AI guided disembly system for automated parts. The system significantly reduced the time cost associated with disembly while also improving the quality of the recovered material. This led to both economy and environmental benefits, showcasing the potential of these technologies in promoting sustainability. For example, the recovered parts are were refurbished and used in new vehicles, reducing the need for new raw materials and lowering the overall carbon footprint of the manufacturing process. In conclusion, lets discuss future insights into sustainable manufacturing and recycling. AI enhanced disembly is poised to become a cornerstone in achieving sustainability as we look to the future, its clear that balancing economic development with ecological stewardship is crucial. AI and robotics offer a viable solution to this challenge. By continuing to innovate and integrate these technologies, we can create a more sustainable future where materials are used efficiently and wastes minimized. Imagine a world where every product can be disassembled and cycled efficiently, where waste is a thing of the past and where economic growth goes hand in hand with environmental responsibility is within our reach. Thanks to the advancement in AI and robotics, and thank you for your attention. I hope you find this presentation insightful and inspiring.
