00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,564
Hello everyone. Today we'll cover generalized product management for enterprises.

2
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:35,400
So if you're a vm looking to incorporate Genai in your

3
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:38,736
products or at your company, this presentation is a good overview

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,604
of the field and what you should consider when building with Genai.

5
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,456
Let's look at the agenda. First, we will cover what is Genai,

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,152
what are the factors that led to its popularity? Whether it

7
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:54,204
is just a hype or is there a long term trend here,

8
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:57,914
we will also look into the impact of Genai on various industries.

9
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:01,138
What are the benefits, and talk about some use cases,

10
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:04,214
how they line up to revenue and cost factors for a company.

11
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:08,370
Lastly, for product managers, we will understand what the risks are

12
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,482
with Genaii, what you can do to mitigate them,

13
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,682
and when you are building for them. Is there anything that you need

14
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:18,094
to consider both for internal use cases and for your customers?

15
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:22,434
So what is Genaida? It is a relatively new

16
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:26,314
trend in the field of artificial intelligence. It is a system that learns

17
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:29,554
from existing data and produces realistic versions

18
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,754
of it that mimic the source data, but are not

19
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:36,442
necessarily a duplicative or exact copies of the

20
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:40,154
source data. This has huge potential for us, because we

21
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:43,562
now can save a lot of time and energy when doing repetitive

22
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:46,946
tasks, or creative tasks like producing images,

23
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,294
music, speech and text.

24
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:53,444
Genei is even perfect for coding, as it can learn

25
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:57,692
from the patterns of any programming language, and you

26
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:01,064
can design new applications and products using that

27
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:04,804
capability. The most useful aspect,

28
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:08,172
however, is the one that doesn't require a lot of technical knowledge to

29
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:12,348
interact with Genai. It simply works by understanding

30
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:15,938
natural language of a user. And so your user can just talk to

31
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:18,882
the tool like they would with any other human being. Let's look at some of

32
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:21,442
the underlying technology that makes Jennair really effective.

33
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:25,994
Right? So we have gans. These are generative adversarial

34
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:29,162
neural networks. This is a machine learning framework where you

35
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:32,266
take a bunch of real images and generate fake ones that are

36
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,842
realistic. And there is this thing called a discriminator, whose job is

37
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:39,810
to try and catch fake ones. And as time progresses, the generator

38
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:43,338
gets really good at fooling the discriminator, and the discriminator in turn

39
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:47,138
gets really good at catching fake ones. And this creates a positive feedback

40
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:50,698
loop. So over time, this results in being able to create

41
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:54,094
highly realistic data using an existing dataset.

42
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:59,194
Next, we have this other technology called variational auto encoders.

43
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:02,802
This is another type of machine learning tool that can generate

44
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:06,402
new data samples that are very much like the training dataset.

45
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:10,138
This helps when we have a very limited data or we need to fill in

46
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:13,718
gaps in the existing data so that we can train our machine

47
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,998
learning models we have with

48
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:20,710
enough data that can produce meaningful results. Then we come

49
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,110
to LLMs. Right? This is the hot topic right now. LLMs are where

50
00:03:24,142 --> 00:03:27,838
all of this magic finally comes together in the hands of regular users,

51
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:31,806
because with LLMs, you can now interact with these machine learning models in a

52
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,518
human language, because the LLMs understand and can generate human

53
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:38,966
language as well. And this is what has resulted in the trend that we now

54
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,162
see in the form of conversational AI suggest chat GPT.

55
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:45,586
Now, let's look at the surge in popularity. Why did Jenny

56
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,214
become popular so suddenly in the recent years? Three things.

57
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:52,794
Firstly, we have better algorithms now that are able to deal

58
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:56,194
with vast amounts of data efficiently and produce high quality,

59
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:59,674
realistic data that resembles the original data. And secondly,

60
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:03,458
we have really great hardware now where GPU makers like Nvidia

61
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:07,506
have come up with some incredibly powerful AI chips that can now train generative

62
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,082
AI models at very large scale. And lastly, we have an

63
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,402
abundance of data that is from decades of human generated

64
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,746
content that is all available on the Internet now. So AI models can now be

65
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,802
trained with this data. Now, let's look at where is the hype

66
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:25,450
as predicted by Gartner. Now,

67
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:29,714
if you looked into what Gartner is predicting, and Gartner is a research

68
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:33,130
firm that deals with, that has a lot of expertise in

69
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:37,034
technology and business feed published research about the trends that

70
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:40,836
happen on time to time. And so, according to Gartner, a generative

71
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,664
AI is in this region called the peak of inflated expectations.

72
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:48,380
This is where everyone is talking about it.

73
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:51,876
A lot of startups we are seeing entering in the space, a lot of businesses

74
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,236
are considering using this technology, and there is a lot of promise and

75
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,964
hope. And if you see what Gartner

76
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:02,812
is predicting, is that Genai will reach this stage

77
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,966
called the plateau of productivity in five to

78
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,006
ten years. When any technology reaches the plateau of productivity,

79
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,470
it means that it is going to be ubiquitous and we will all be interacting

80
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:16,222
with it in some fashion on a daily basis.

81
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:19,630
So there's a lot of promise, and this signals that Genei

82
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:22,718
is here to stay. And let's look at some more predictions

83
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:26,126
that Gartner has given in terms of what the adoption

84
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,874
of Genei is going to be in the enterprise space.

85
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:33,006
It is predicted that by the end of 2024, that is, this year,

86
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,594
40% of enterprise applications will have some

87
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:40,234
form of conversational AI embedded within their systems, whether it is

88
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:43,614
internal or external, facing towards users.

89
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:48,642
And in 2025, 30% of enterprises will be implementing

90
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:52,226
AI, augmented development and testing in their internal processes as they

91
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,362
come up with new applications and products in. By 2026,

92
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:59,410
60% of enterprises will be incorporating Genai

93
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:02,570
in their websites and mobile apps as well,

94
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:06,138
which all companies now have such presence. So 60% is

95
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:10,404
a very huge adoption figure. And by 2026

96
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,804
it is predicted that at least 100 million people will be interacting with

97
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:18,776
robo colleagues or Jenny Eye pilot like scenarios as they go

98
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,600
about doing their work. Which means right now we use tools like browsers

99
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:26,160
and office and Windows and macOS, etcetera. But Genei

100
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:30,144
is also going to become very popular and everyone's going to start using it as

101
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:34,644
their go as a work tool. Lastly, by 2027

102
00:06:35,214 --> 00:06:39,894
predicted that around 15% of all newly developed applications

103
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:43,422
will be automatically generated by AI without any human

104
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:47,406
involvement, which is a huge deal. Now let's look at some

105
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,910
industries that are impacted by Genei and what potential use

106
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:55,074
cases and applications that each of these industries will be seeing

107
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:59,758
first. In the pharmaceutical industry, Genei can be used for

108
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:04,336
drug discovery, clinical trial design and patient data analysis.

109
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,016
This is a mainstay of the pharmaceutical industry and Genea is going

110
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,240
to help the main core value products within this business

111
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,680
and in the manufacturing sector. Genea can optimize production

112
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:20,168
processes. It can automate repetitive tasks.

113
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:23,984
It can help in quality control as well. In the field of

114
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:27,120
media, Ji can generate articles, it can help

115
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:30,624
authors and publishers draft content, come up with new ideas,

116
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:34,526
change the language and tone, come up with personalized recommendations,

117
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,350
and can even be a good brainstorming tool. In the field of

118
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:41,870
architecture, Chenai can assist in design and

119
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:45,830
in coming up with planning project planning for buildings, it can help.

120
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:49,622
It can act as a good brainstorming tool for architects

121
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:53,494
as they're going about their designs. Similarly, in interior design as well,

122
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:57,318
right? You can imagine Genei helping interior designers come up with

123
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:00,704
ideas very quickly for their clients. In the field of

124
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:04,640
engineering, Chennai can help with product design, any simulations,

125
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:07,832
the data that is needed for running simulations, it can fill in the gaps,

126
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:11,920
it can do analysis on those simulations, can optimize various

127
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:16,112
functions in the engineering disciplines. In the field of automobile and

128
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,624
automotive industry, Chenai can help with vehicle design, can help

129
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:23,560
with autonomous driving systems. We have Tesla and many other ev manufacturers

130
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:27,308
now are venturing into this space, so that is a big

131
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:30,892
adoption there as well. Similarly, for aerospace and defense,

132
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:35,108
there are lots of flight simulations and optimizations and autonomous

133
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:38,264
systems that can be benefited from the use of Genei.

134
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:42,660
And in the field of medicine and being Genei can help assist in imaging

135
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:46,684
analysis, we have x rays and MRI scans, etcetera. And Genei can help

136
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:50,348
both patients and healthcare providers predict the progression of

137
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:54,092
any disease or condition that a patient has. It can also help

138
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:57,836
the patients get personalized treatment plans on behalf of the

139
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,924
healthcare provider as well. Let's look at some benefits

140
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:04,148
of Genai that are very relevant for enterprises.

141
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:07,908
We talked about the applications previously, but what are the specific

142
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:11,620
sectors within enterprise that can directly benefit?

143
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:15,668
So first, as we discussed previously, product development can be greatly enhanced

144
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:19,364
by Genai. It can be accelerated because with the

145
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:23,012
help of coding assistance or by streamlining the design process

146
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:26,650
and creating, helping enterprises create new product offerings

147
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:30,394
within their core product by incorporating Genai to the customers.

148
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:33,698
And then there's a field of customer experience where a lot of customers interact

149
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:37,266
with the enterprises for support, and Genei can come

150
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,722
and help with these interactions as well. Where when a customer is

151
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:44,714
talking to the support team, the support agents

152
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:48,202
can have a detailed case analysis of what this customer wants.

153
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:51,674
The customer themselves can deal directly, first with the Genei

154
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:55,650
assistant and probably be routed to the right pathways that the that

155
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:59,354
the customer support team can then handle. And then employee productivity

156
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:03,018
itself, right? Like for enterprises, when they incorporate Genai,

157
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:06,794
all the employment employees can become much more efficient and

158
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:11,042
automate their repetitive tasks. And employees can get intelligent insights

159
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:14,254
reports without having to do a lot of number crunching.

160
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:18,194
Let's dig deeper into some use

161
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:21,762
cases. Right. What are the specific capabilities of Genei that we

162
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:25,982
know today? First, we have this capability of Jennai, that is in writing,

163
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,886
where Jenny, I can produce a draft output and you can

164
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,598
even ask Jenny what business style should it be professional,

165
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:37,278
should it be casual, what length should it be? Etcetera. And Jenny, I can

166
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:40,574
get you started with a boilerplate draft, and then as an employee,

167
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:43,154
you can start building on top of the draft.

168
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:47,222
It can also help you in discovery if there's a

169
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:50,790
vast amount of data, for example, internal employee wikis and

170
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:54,342
knowledge bases. Employees can then directly ask a question,

171
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:58,014
vision AI, and get the right answers neatly summarized, rather than having

172
00:10:58,054 --> 00:11:01,674
to find very specific article in our traditional search experience,

173
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:06,166
it can manipulate tone and soften the language as we

174
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,742
spoke about earlier as well. So employees don't have

175
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:13,310
to spend a lot of time in really crafting

176
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:16,598
their messages and their documents. Genei can easily

177
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:20,090
take that load for you. And then next we have the capability of

178
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:23,450
synthesis, which is where Genei can summarize vast amounts of

179
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:27,282
data into easily consumable output. So it can shorten

180
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:31,066
emails, it can shorten any conversations and chats that you're having

181
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,626
internal company forums, any web pages that the company

182
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,986
has. All of them can be neatly summarized and be made available to

183
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,154
you on the fly. It can also simplify any

184
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:44,962
rules, and if your company has lots of instructions for you as you're

185
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:48,410
learning and onboarding into the company, it can simplify all of

186
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,936
that and make those was easily digestible to you. So learning becomes much

187
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,832
easier. It can also like classify and sort content right

188
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:59,368
again, today, all of this is done manually. Somebody's going and adding

189
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:03,048
these hashtags and sentiments, etcetera. But generally I can easily

190
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:06,176
do that. And this is useful both for employees. It is useful

191
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,240
for managers and HR who want to understand what the employee

192
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:13,616
sentiment is around the company. It can help you even do

193
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,404
sentiment analysis on your customer experience,

194
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:21,082
on your user research. If customers are giving you feedback on reviews

195
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:24,802
on public forums, you can easily start that now and get a sense of

196
00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:28,258
what the sentiment is. And similarly like

197
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:32,130
in the support and customer care interactions, Genai can

198
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:35,906
basically incorporated in the chat experiences now, we all have

199
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,530
this experience where we interact with any company's customer care via

200
00:12:39,562 --> 00:12:42,978
chat experiences now. So with the presence of Genai,

201
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:46,458
this all becomes much easy. Now, we have some

202
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:49,490
advanced use cases as well. As we previously talked about,

203
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:53,418
there's a field of coding, as we talked about. As developers within these companies

204
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,794
are building applications, they can now use Genai as

205
00:12:56,834 --> 00:13:00,914
a copilot and help with the code generation, quickly finding

206
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:04,562
the right documentation needed to move forward, etcetera. Some of the

207
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:07,266
other things we don't have to get into, which we spoke about earlier as well.

208
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,094
In the field of medicine and data science as well.

209
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:14,174
Let's look at what problems Genei is solving. Right what are

210
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:17,814
the right ways to think about? If you're a product manager, how do you think

211
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:21,246
about incorporating Genai? These are the few ways

212
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,686
in which you can do it. One, if you're a product manager, first, you can

213
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,606
think about integrating Genai into your core products, which is

214
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,674
you have existing products that your customers are already using,

215
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:35,390
and you can think about how you can enhance their experience with those

216
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:38,146
existing products with the help of Genaid.

217
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,702
The other way is to create new product offerings entirely,

218
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:44,686
whose main value proposition itself is Genai.

219
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,278
So these are in addition to your existing

220
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:52,790
line of products, and for which you can even charge a premium because customers

221
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:56,638
get a much more productive and efficient experience. The other

222
00:13:56,686 --> 00:14:00,254
way to think about is employee efficiency. So if you're a product manager,

223
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:04,622
you can think about how to solve these problems within your company itself

224
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,198
rather than external facing. So you can think about how do you make your

225
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:11,780
product team more efficient? How are they brainstorming? How are

226
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:15,420
they, how are the developers, how fast are the developers in coming up with new

227
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:19,860
products? And can you incorporate Genai in those workflows? That basically

228
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:24,252
you can think about the first two, which is integrating in core products and integrating

229
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:28,012
in new core new products as revenue generators

230
00:14:28,188 --> 00:14:31,988
and the employee efficiency. And the next one is process improvements as

231
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:35,580
cost reduction genai in a revenue stream. Jenny.

232
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:39,092
And then cost reduction Genii. Right, so as we talked about it,

233
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:42,612
so what are the, how do we think about the Genii features and

234
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:46,380
their capabilities? Right. Let's go a little bit deeper

235
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:50,364
into that. Some of the Genii features which we previously talked about are

236
00:14:50,444 --> 00:14:53,620
automated summarization, for example. Right again,

237
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:57,644
summarizing content for people being able to create new content.

238
00:14:57,724 --> 00:15:01,652
For example, your marketing team can now very quickly come up

239
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:05,128
with new assets, new content and copy that can be used

240
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:08,512
within the product, within your faqs and help centers

241
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:12,672
and public landing pages. All of this can now be sped up

242
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:16,400
dramatically. And then you can use the features of synthesis

243
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:19,840
of information and you can get customer

244
00:15:19,872 --> 00:15:23,088
case summaries, insights and reporting about customers as well.

245
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:27,288
Very quickly offer search in a natural language to

246
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:31,280
your customers. Today, your customers might be searching for something and

247
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,576
you're having to invest in a search experience that goes in

248
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,966
indexes, all the search results. But with the help of Genai, you don't have

249
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,710
to do that. You can. Your customers can speak in a natural language or

250
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:45,502
type in a natural language. They should be able to find any

251
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:49,886
data that they have with your company. A little fine

252
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,438
tuning is required for this, but automated actions are a very good use

253
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:57,622
case potentially in the future as well. So if you have products in

254
00:15:57,638 --> 00:16:01,286
the home automation space, or payments and productivity use cases like note

255
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,588
taking apps, or to do lists, etcetera, or any office

256
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:08,424
productivity applications, you can also think about automated actions

257
00:16:08,964 --> 00:16:12,484
that your customers can do. As I previously said,

258
00:16:12,524 --> 00:16:16,084
you can think about Genai capabilities into two categories. One is top

259
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:20,284
line. Top line means that these are use

260
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:23,884
cases where you can integrate Genai into your products,

261
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:28,452
external facing products, which means you can therefore command

262
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:32,070
new revenue. They augment your existing revenue streams.

263
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:36,018
And then you can think about the other category as bottom line, which is integrating

264
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:39,506
Genai into your internal company processes like

265
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,134
business reporting, internal communications, knowledge management,

266
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:46,794
feedback processing, customer support, etcetera. And in all

267
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:49,934
these areas, Genai will reduce costs dramatically.

268
00:16:51,114 --> 00:16:54,546
So those are the two ways to think about it. If you're a product manager

269
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,230
looking to incorporate Genai, in your day to day life,

270
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:01,934
let's look about, let's look into some risks of Genaii, right?

271
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:05,294
So if you're a product manager and if you're, whether it is internal or

272
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:08,838
external, there are a few risks that you must be aware of.

273
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:12,894
One is Genai need not always be accurate.

274
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:16,254
The systems sometimes produce fabricated answers which we call

275
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:19,382
as hallucinations now. So this is a big risk. If you're,

276
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,862
if you're dealing with something very business critical, you need to

277
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:27,238
be able to consider. You should be able to consider this before releasing your Genai

278
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:30,592
features. The other aspect is bias. The data

279
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:33,960
that is used to train the model can also be biased and this can influence

280
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:37,964
the results in a negative way and impact the business operations significantly.

281
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:42,328
Lastly, intellectual property, right? Sometimes it's possible

282
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,736
depending on what model that you're using, whether it is in house or

283
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,444
it is a third party LLM solution like OpenAI's solution,

284
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:53,536
it is possible that the model that they're using can be ingested

285
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,604
on some proprietary and sensitive information.

286
00:17:57,394 --> 00:18:00,498
And this can sometimes leak information. Sensitive information,

287
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:04,090
or even the information that you are using or the customers

288
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:08,002
are using to interact with Genei can

289
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:11,802
inadvertently be used to train the model and therefore be

290
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:15,754
available to others outside the company as well. So this has to be considered

291
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:19,674
now with the risks in mind. Imagine you're a PM

292
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:23,346
now and you're looking to integrate Chennai into your

293
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,180
product and you want, and you're doing this with a goal to

294
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:30,876
improve the customer experience or to reduce costs and make your

295
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,852
internal processes more efficient. And you have identified

296
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,944
a suitable LLM to power this experience.

297
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:41,716
I would advise these as the next steps that you should take. First, I think

298
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,900
you should thoroughly evaluate the LLM model

299
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:49,740
that you have selected and you have to understand its capabilities and

300
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:53,734
its limitations. As we talked about previously, some LLMs have

301
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:57,494
different accuracies. They may be biased towards certain data

302
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:01,254
sets, etcetera. So it's good to always assess the performance with

303
00:19:01,294 --> 00:19:04,638
respect to what your product needs to do. So you can think

304
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,590
you can grade your LLM based on these aspects, right?

305
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:10,822
How good is it at natural language processing? How good is

306
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:14,854
it at content generation? How good is it with automation, for example,

307
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:18,630
if that is your use case? Always good to think about accuracy and bias,

308
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:22,446
as I said previously. Next, you have to define the use cases and

309
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,246
user journeys very clearly. And it's good to document these use cases and

310
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,630
share it with your team so that they're all aware and they're able to map

311
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:33,766
out the user journey and the touch points where Genei can be seamlessly integrated,

312
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,558
and again, this can be in the field of content creation,

313
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:39,718
customer support, task automation, synthesis,

314
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:41,874
summarization, or what have you.

315
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:46,662
Next, you need to think about developing an AI strategy.

316
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,176
I will go into this in detail

317
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,304
sharply, but the idea here is to deploy Genei

318
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:57,424
in a responsible fashion in a way that ensures transparency,

319
00:19:57,544 --> 00:20:02,072
accountability and user control. And we have to provide some mechanisms

320
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:05,464
for customers to deal with inaccuracy or bias,

321
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:09,640
etcetera. And we also have to ensure that the whole experience is

322
00:20:09,712 --> 00:20:13,592
private and no accidental leaks of confidential information happens

323
00:20:13,688 --> 00:20:17,416
when customers are entering their sensitive data in these prompts and

324
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,914
when they're interacting with any. You also need to implement some governance

325
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:24,554
and monitoring mechanisms where you should be overseeing the integration

326
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:27,930
and the ongoing operation of GenaI within your product. This could

327
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:31,894
be setting up dashboards to monitor continuously the model's performance,

328
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,890
to continuously monitor what users are saying in their

329
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:39,586
feedback when they're interacting with Genai, and always

330
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,534
having a process to continuously improve those experiences.

331
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:46,194
As we talked about it, when we say responsible AI,

332
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:50,042
the goal here is to establish trust, because a lot of the

333
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:54,200
times customers, customers have this distrust with anything that is AI,

334
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:57,840
because again, they're scared that the results can

335
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:01,128
be inaccurate, they're scared that it can be biased,

336
00:21:01,256 --> 00:21:04,896
or their sensitive content may be used to train the AI model and

337
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,528
therefore some secret business secrets can be leaked

338
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:12,632
externally. So what you should do is think about the

339
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:16,168
following. First, make sure you add disclaimers

340
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:20,060
in your products when you're using Genaid. These disclaimers

341
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:24,004
should clearly communicate that AI generated content can be inaccurate

342
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:27,996
and so that customers can manage their expectations and

343
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,504
exercise some caution. Before using these results,

344
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:34,596
you must implement some reporting tools so

345
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,324
that when Jenny comes out with some result which the user

346
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,668
finds harmful or violates their community

347
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:45,276
policies or any other policies that

348
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,326
may have, that they may have, they should be able to immediately report it and

349
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,478
give you a reason why they think it is bad, for example.

350
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:56,342
And you should be continuously monitoring these reports as well. You should also

351
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,494
give fallback options to customers so that they are not completely

352
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:03,998
reliant on AI powered experiences in order to get value from your product.

353
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:06,918
There should be some fallback where a user can say, I don't want to use

354
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:10,462
AI, but I still want to complete this job that I have for which I

355
00:22:10,478 --> 00:22:14,592
am paying you as a customer. Next criteria is transparency.

356
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:17,936
You should provide clear messaging to users indicating when

357
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,128
they're interacting with an AI system that, yeah, they are interacting with AI

358
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:24,432
should not be behind the scenes. And invisible to the user. So it

359
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:28,248
should be very clear that if they're, if a genai is

360
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:32,056
being used, or an LLM is being used to provide an experience to the users,

361
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,248
they should clearly know that in the UI, wherever possible

362
00:22:35,336 --> 00:22:38,632
and applicable, you should use citations and explanations. So if Jenny

363
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,880
is giving a customer, your customers some results, or your

364
00:22:41,912 --> 00:22:45,210
employees some results, it is

365
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:48,554
good to have a source from where this has come from,

366
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:52,538
so that customers have that added layer of trust that

367
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:56,274
this is coming from a known source, and it's not a mere hallucination

368
00:22:56,354 --> 00:22:59,834
by Genai. There are some deployment models

369
00:22:59,954 --> 00:23:03,682
that you should know about before you go about actually using an

370
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:07,770
LL. The first one is off the shelf. This is where

371
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:11,722
you're considering an LLM that is directly available in the market today,

372
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:14,814
like for example, OpenAI or any other product.

373
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:19,680
These models are already pre trained and they're not really aware

374
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:23,472
of your business context or the customer's data. They're just off the

375
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:27,160
shelf. Basically, the good thing with this is it provides a quick and easy

376
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:30,360
way to integrate genai immediately and deliver value for your

377
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:33,992
products or for your internal processes. Then we have

378
00:23:34,088 --> 00:23:36,904
fine tuned or bespoke models. In this case,

379
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:41,200
the LLM is fine tuned with the data from the enterprise, and this significantly

380
00:23:41,232 --> 00:23:44,560
increases the output quality, because any

381
00:23:44,752 --> 00:23:48,256
prompts or any questions you have for AI, the answers will

382
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,712
be highly relevant to you, because that AI knows the context about

383
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:54,776
your company or your customers data,

384
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,344
etcetera. And then we have instance based LLMs.

385
00:23:58,424 --> 00:24:01,696
Now, the instance based LLMs are a version of fine tuned bespoke

386
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,312
models, but they have the added benefit of being

387
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:09,648
run entirely in house. And therefore there is no risk of any

388
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:13,512
sensitive data making to a competitor. Or in the case of off the

389
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:17,024
shelf, you still have that risk. If you are giving some sensitive information

390
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:20,424
in the, in the prompt itself, then that can be

391
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:23,616
used to train the ALM and you have no control over it. But in the

392
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,064
instance based model, you control all of these boundaries

393
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:29,924
and therefore the data never leaves your instance.

394
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,560
So these are the enterprise policies when Jennai should

395
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:36,912
be adopted, right? When Jenny is being adopted. So if you're

396
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:40,720
integrating internally within your company, or if you

397
00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:43,216
are a PM for an enterprise, for a b two b in a b two

398
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,854
B space, you are. Customers will also expect these

399
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:50,278
policies to be supported. One is to protect

400
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:53,710
privacy, right? So in case of, if your product

401
00:24:53,862 --> 00:24:57,590
allows for users to upload images, and that is being processed

402
00:24:57,622 --> 00:25:01,278
by Genai, you have to ensure that if there are any faces,

403
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:04,686
they are blurred and there's no potential to for the

404
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,862
LLM to ingest these faces and then later output

405
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:11,872
some other images using those faces. You should avoid sensitive

406
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:15,872
data. Make sure that you again give disclaimers to your employees or

407
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:19,872
your customers that hey, do not enter any sensitive data here, or being

408
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:23,624
able to detect sensitive data and not even allowing Genai to

409
00:25:23,744 --> 00:25:27,016
actually get trained on that data. The other way to do this is

410
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,840
also to secure data. You can even turn off logging at the LLM side

411
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:34,976
so that if I enter a query or if I enter a prompt,

412
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,104
the LLM merely processes the prompt and gives me an output, but will

413
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:43,094
not store that prompt and therefore will not train the LLM.

414
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,966
You can consider implementing your solution in that

415
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,638
way also, and the next policy is to protect PII

416
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:54,390
which is personally identifiable information. So when using Genei

417
00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:58,070
in your experiences, you have to make sure that you're not actually

418
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:01,302
logging the user's sensitive information, like their name

419
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:04,790
or their gender, where they are, their IP address. All of this

420
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:08,618
should not be going to the NLM. You should also

421
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:12,154
provide controls for the admins of your

422
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:15,690
customers so that if they don't want to use Genai they should

423
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:18,978
be able to turn it off. Or if they don't want to deploy Genai for

424
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:22,090
all of the company, they should be able to control

425
00:26:22,162 --> 00:26:25,530
and configure who should be able to use it, what is the level of

426
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:28,946
interactions that they can have, what is allowed and what is not allowed

427
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,146
to be shared with this genei. So this is all good to

428
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,728
have as a configurable admin control settings.

429
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:39,300
That's it guys. This has been a discussion about.

430
00:26:39,412 --> 00:26:43,304
This has been a high level introduction about product management in the Genai space.

431
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:47,212
Thank you for listening and I hope this was very useful to.
