00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:21,434
that drive loyalty and growth. Again, in the age

186
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,694
of automation, maintaining customer trust is paramount

187
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:29,546
for businesses as LLM models and

188
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,654
other automated systems become integral for customer support.

189
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:38,170
Ensuring transparency and reliability in interactions is crucial

190
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:41,814
to preserving trust. To build and maintain

191
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:45,942
trust in customer relations, we businesses must prioritize

192
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,554
transparency and authenticity.

193
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:53,142
This can be achieved by clearly communicating the

194
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:56,830
use of automation and human intervention in customer support

195
00:12:56,902 --> 00:13:00,494
processes, providing accurate and helpful

196
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:04,634
information even when utilizing automated systems,

197
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:09,122
offering avenues for customers to escalate issues to human

198
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:13,042
agents when necessary, ensuring personalized assistance

199
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:16,890
when needed, and finally,

200
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:20,834
regularly seeking feedback from customers and using it to improve

201
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:24,454
support processes and enhance the overall experience.

202
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:29,930

203
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:32,534
confidence in their customer support practices,

204
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:37,824
leading to stronger customer relationship and loyalty.

205
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:42,308
Now, let's look at the question how do stakeholders perceive

206
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:45,104
the role of LLM models in customer support?

207
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:50,824

213
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,102
importance of transparency. Customers desire transparency regarding

214
00:14:16,158 --> 00:14:19,274

226
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:09,526
replaced by them. And from the

227
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,514

240
00:16:03,326 --> 00:16:07,434
and challenges. While these models offer efficiency and scalability,

241
00:16:07,774 --> 00:16:11,414
stakeholders express varying perspectives on

242
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:15,110
their role and impact. Customers seek faster

243
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:19,086

250
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,488
an intriguing question arises. Are LLM

251
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:50,144
models truly revolutionizing customer support, or do they

252
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:53,912
risk undermining the

253
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:57,164

254
00:16:57,744 --> 00:17:01,168
As we embark on this journey of innovation, finding the

255
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:04,960
