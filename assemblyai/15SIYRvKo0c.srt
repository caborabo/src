00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,686
Hi everyone, everyone, my name is Dmitry Bardysh and I'm happy to see you all.

2
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:31,474
The conference today I'm going to share my thoughts on the emergency

3
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:34,870
of e commerce and the future of traditional shopping.

4
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,462
So let's get to the point. I think everybody knows that

5
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:43,286
while e commerce is growing quickly, the physical stores themselves

6
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:47,382
continue playing a major role. The question remains whether

7
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:51,166
in store shopping can survive and compete with the convenience and

8
00:00:51,188 --> 00:00:54,814
personalization of ecommerce over the long term, or if

9
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:58,830
online shopping will eventually dominate the retail landscape.

10
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,382
But first of all, let me give you a quick introduction about me.

11
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:07,954
So here you can see my career highlights and I've got more than

12
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:11,646
six or six years of work experience at ride changing,

13
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:15,250
food, tech and delivery and here are some links if you want to connect

14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,190
with me. I'm happy to have chat with you guys on the various of topics.

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,166
So let's talk about the problem itself, how it all started and how

16
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:27,634
it is going now, right? Ecommerce has undeniably

17
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:30,966
surged in recent years, with sales skyrocketing

18
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:35,402
to over $6 trillion globally in 2022 and

19
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:38,730
still poised to climb even further.

20
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,314
Its share of retail market has also seen remarkable

21
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:46,222
growth, reaching 18% in 2022 and

22
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:50,046
projected to hit almost 22% by 2024.

23
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:53,458
With estimated almost 3 billion online

24
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:56,814
shoppers in 2024, the digital

25
00:01:56,862 --> 00:01:59,486
shopping landscape is expanding rapidly,

26
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:03,534
fueled in part by the COVID-19 pandemic which accelerated

27
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:07,206
online adoption during lockdowns. On the

28
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:10,934
other hand, instore shopping remains robust, bouncing back

29
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:14,502
in 20, 29 21 sorry. With an

30
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:18,442
almost 8% growth to almost 21 trillion of dollars,

31
00:02:18,576 --> 00:02:21,558
surpassing pre pandemic levels,

32
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:25,578
a recent survey shows that almost 43% of

33
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:29,146
the consumers still prefer the tangible experience of

34
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:32,974
in store shopping. So with

35
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:36,926
that all being said, we may come up with the hypothesis like that the

36
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,682
future of commerce is a dynamic interplay between the digital

37
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:44,746
and traditional retail realms. But let's

38
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:49,490
try to answer the simple question why people can't resist online shopping.

39
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,874
In order to find the answer to this question, we have to go deep into

40
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:57,494
the main reasons of ecommerce. Boom. And it all

41
00:02:57,532 --> 00:03:01,526
started from the obvious, the rise of the mobile devices when

42
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,278
it comes to number of factors, right?

43
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:07,622
And let's get a bit more in depth about

44
00:03:07,676 --> 00:03:11,926
them. The first one is a global reach. Ecommerce provides

45
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,382
businesses with the ability to reach a global audience,

46
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:19,500
breaking down the geographical barriers. They have 24

47
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,890
per seven days. Accessibility.

48
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,342
Online stores are open almost every

49
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:30,526
hour, every minute, and it basically allows customers to

50
00:03:30,548 --> 00:03:33,874
shop there at their convenience, regardless of the time zones or

51
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:37,794
business hours. Also, about the convenience, right? Consumers can

52
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:41,186
shop from the comfort of their homes, avoiding the need to travel to

53
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,818
physical stores. Also, it's all about the

54
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:48,550
wide product selection. Ecommerce platforms themselves offer

55
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,094
a different number of products, often more

56
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,110
extensive than it is available in brick and mortar stores.

57
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,526
Don't forget about the cost savings. Both businesses and consumers

58
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:05,014
can save on costs related to physical storefronts such as rent,

59
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:07,850
utilities, travel expenses and salaries.

60
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,346
Don't forget about time efficiency as well. Online shopping

61
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:15,866
eliminates the need to wait in line, searching for the crowds

62
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:19,914
or deal with the limited store hours. Also, don't forget

63
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:23,582
about the personalization. Ecommerce websites can offer

64
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:27,166
personalized recommendations based on the user

65
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:30,500
preferences and purchase history. Also,

66
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,678
it's all about the ease of comparison.

67
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,634
Consumers can easily compare prices, features and reviews

68
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:41,334
of products across different brands and vendors. We already

69
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:44,786
talked about the personalization, right? But don't forget about the user

70
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,006
reviews themselves. Customers can make informed

71
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,354
decisions based on the experiences of others and

72
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,954
reviews shared by other buyers before even trying to buy the

73
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,100
real product. Also,

74
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,738
ecommerce boom gives accessibility for small businesses.

75
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:07,866
What does it mean? Basically, it's all about the fact that ecommerce levels

76
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:11,306
the playing field, allowing small businesses to compete

77
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:14,530
with larger enterprises on the global scale.

78
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,534
Also, it's all about reduced marketing

79
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:23,154
costs. Digital marketing is often more cost effective than

80
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:27,042
traditional advertising methods make it more accessible

81
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:30,978
to businesses of all sizes. In addition,

82
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:34,854
it's about data collection. Ecommerce platforms can

83
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:37,790
collect valuable data on customer behavior,

84
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,410
helping businesses refine their strategies and offerings.

85
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,114
Also, due to the ecommerce boom, we can see

86
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:51,040
the faster transactions between people and between the company and people.

87
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,694
Online payments and digital transactions streamline the purchasing process,

88
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:59,646
reducing checkout times. Also, in terms of the

89
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:03,102
inventory management, basically, ecommerce systems

90
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,510
enable efficient tracking and management of inventory

91
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,030
levels, reducing the likelihood of overstock on stockholms.

92
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,146
Also, we already spoke about targeted marketing, but let's say about

93
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,810
that as well. Businesses can tailor marketing efforts

94
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,634
based on customer data, ensuring that promotions are super relevant

95
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:25,286
and appealing. Also, don't forget about the

96
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:28,682
flexible shopping experience. Consumers can shop

97
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:31,734
using various devices such as smartphones, tablets,

98
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:35,130
computers, even TV, changing flexibility.

99
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,686
Also, it is important to say about the environmental impact

100
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:44,054
digital transactions and online shopping contribute to reducing the environmental impact

101
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:46,510
associated with traditional retail practices.

102
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,718
Also, there is one thing which is quite important for the companies,

103
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:54,434
it's the dynamic pricing. Ecommerce allows for them

104
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:57,982
dynamic pricing strategies. Adjusting prices based on demand,

105
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:02,770
seasonality or other factors. Also altogether

106
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,242
gives them ability to focus on the customer service and chatbots

107
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:11,926
automated systems which can handle routine customer

108
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:16,530
inquiries, basically improving efficiency and responsiveness.

109
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,398
And finally, don't forget about the scalability.

110
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:23,334
Ecommerce businesses can easily scale their operations

111
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:26,666
abroad, accommodating increased demand without the need

112
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:29,580
of significant infrastructure changes.

113
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,070
When we talk about the ecommerce,

114
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,902
we have to talk about some main trends which take place

115
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:41,134
at the moment. And let's start

116
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:44,702
from the first one. I think the most notable

117
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:48,366
trend in ecommerce is the surge in mobile commerce.

118
00:07:48,558 --> 00:07:53,182
For example, in 2019, mobile ecommerce constituted

119
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:56,514
only 67% of total ecommerce

120
00:07:56,562 --> 00:08:00,998
sales, but by 2021 figure

121
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:04,422
projected to rise by almost

122
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:07,314
73%, according to Statista.

123
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:11,654
This shift is fueled by the widespread of use of smartphones

124
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:15,354
and tablets, providing the convenient shopping experiences for

125
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:18,586
businesses to remain competitive. Having a mobile friendly website

126
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:23,498
or app is quite crucial at the moment. Another trend in

127
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:26,830
ecommerce is the increasing importance of social commerce.

128
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,714
Platforms like Instagram and Facebook and TikTok

129
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:34,034
and others are now becoming significant sales channels for

130
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:37,490
businesses. According to Shopify,

131
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,050
almost 80% of american consumers say that

132
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,766
they have discovered products on the Facebook and 55 of

133
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:49,270
them have purchased products online after discovering them on social

134
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,062
media. That's why I can say that user experience is

135
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,530
quite crucial to the success of the ecommerce

136
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,122
websites. And the last

137
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:02,886
one. According to a study by Kiss Metrics,

138
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:06,182
47% of consumers expect a page to load

139
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:09,814
in 2 seconds or less, and 40% will abandon

140
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:13,642
a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load.

141
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,986
Additionally to that, 88% of online consumers

142
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:20,880
are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience.

143
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,514
This basically means that businesses need to invest in fast,

144
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:28,414
responsive websites, intuitive navigation and user friendly

145
00:09:28,462 --> 00:09:29,330
interfaces.

146
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,446
But the question is still in the air. Why do

147
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:38,600
people still love shopping in real life?

148
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,582
In my point of view, there are four main reasons for it. The first

149
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:46,534
one is tangible experience. Despite the

150
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:50,474
conveniences of ecommerce, many still favor

151
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:54,198
in store shopping for its tangible and experiential

152
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:58,262
nature. The second one is the avoiding risks,

153
00:09:58,326 --> 00:10:02,222
which may happen in online instore shopping has

154
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:05,534
some online risks like shipping fees, delays and

155
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,510
potential issues with damaged items.

156
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,742
A retail dive survey reveals that 62% prefer

157
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:17,118
physical examination of the products, with 49% aiming

158
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:19,410
to dodge shipping costs.

159
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,002
Also, don't forget about the face to face experience and according to PwC

160
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:29,078
survey, 74% of global consumers desire more

161
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:33,366
human interaction while shopping. And the last one is

162
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:36,770
overall appeal. And I would say that music, mood,

163
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,006
sense and visuals contribute to overall appeal,

164
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:43,754
as indicated by a survey where 90% of people are more

165
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:46,810
likely to purchase than they enjoy the stores environment.

166
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,134
But let's think about some examples of really big

167
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:54,670
companies, how they adapted to new reality.

168
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,006
In my opinion, they use a kind of mixed approach and it

169
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:02,474
can be stated that we witness some kind of

170
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:05,954
omnichannel revolution. That basically means

171
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:09,422
that successful retailers, or e retailers

172
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:12,846
as they say, will use online and in store experiences

173
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:16,950
to define the unique and successful brand differentiation.

174
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,350
Basically, there are three good examples which I would like to point

175
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,754
out. And here are the success stories of Walmart,

176
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:29,098
Starbucks and Sephora. All of them integrated physical and online

177
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:33,270
channels for a seamless shopping experience. And all of them benefited

178
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,190
from it by getting an enhanced convenience

179
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,606
selection and better personalization for customers.

180
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:44,094
But let's talk about some numbers here. For example,

181
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:48,170
Starbucks recently reached 31 million monthly app users

182
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,818
and 41% of US sales from rewards

183
00:11:51,914 --> 00:11:55,634
program. In terms of Walmart, Walmart has

184
00:11:55,832 --> 00:12:00,594
more than 268,000,000 customers and

185
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:04,782
more than 63% of growth in ecommerce

186
00:12:04,846 --> 00:12:08,760
sales year over year by the 2021.

187
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,710
In terms of C four, they got 31 million

188
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,406
loyalty members, exceptional customer retention and

189
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:17,880
according to recent research.

190
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,894
But let's talk about some future trends

191
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:27,114
in retail. I personally would like to point out three

192
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:31,082
of them. The first one is a personalized mobile

193
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:34,922
shopping. And I think that consumers seek tailored

194
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:38,634
recommendations and experiences by using their mobile

195
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:42,238
devices, laptops or whatever. And the good example

196
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:45,330
here will be Shopify's success,

197
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,362
who's got 1.75

198
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,686
billion merchants and 86% revenue increase

199
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:55,790
in 2020. The second one is sustainability

200
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,842
practices. It's all about the growing demand for eco friendly practices

201
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:04,306
in retail. And I can say that there is a leader in Patagonia

202
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:08,226
which company donates 1% of sales to environmental

203
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:11,702
causes. And the third one is the emergent technologies.

204
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:14,460
And I would like to stay here a bit for more.

205
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,294
I personally believe that all the things related

206
00:13:18,342 --> 00:13:21,070
to new technologies, such as virtual reality,

207
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,182
using chat, GPT, using all

208
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:28,014
other things which are kind of popular right now,

209
00:13:28,132 --> 00:13:32,560
enhance immersive shopping experiences. And the good example

210
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,306
here can be Ikea's AR app,

211
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:40,110
which basically boosts online sales through visualizing

212
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,010
products in customer homes.

213
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,454
But if you think about the future and about the upcoming years,

214
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:52,242
the question will be quite simple. Can retailers

215
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:56,178
crack the code to seamlessly blend the tactile allure of physical stores

216
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:59,222
with the boundless possibilities of digital shopping,

217
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:03,446
ultimately sculpting a retail landscape that caters perfectly

218
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:06,090
to diverse consumer needs and preferences?

219
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,340
And in my opinion, the short answer is yes.

220
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,390
The first point here is diverse consumer

221
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,774
preferences. And I would say that physical stores appeal to

222
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:21,310
tangible interactions and immersive experiences, and online

223
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,326
shopping caters to innovation, convenience and personalized recommendations.

224
00:14:25,518 --> 00:14:29,570
Also, the second thing here is omnichannel integrations.

225
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,238
It's all about the blending physical and digital models which enhance

226
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:37,394
convenience, loyalty and data insights.

227
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:41,094
Also, it's all about the ongoing innovations. And as

228
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:44,806
I said earlier, it comes to the personalization, mobile tech and

229
00:14:44,828 --> 00:14:49,030
sustainability which contributes to reshaping the retail landscape

230
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,020
itself. The third thing here is adaptable brand for the future.

231
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,842
And I think that traditional retail's future

232
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,106
relies on adaptable, creative brands. And it's all about

233
00:15:00,128 --> 00:15:03,914
the thoughtful transformation of physical spaces which can maintain

234
00:15:03,962 --> 00:15:08,074
relevance. And the fourth thing here is a consumer driven

235
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:11,358
equilibrium. I think that future success

236
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,782
depends on defining the ideal balance between in person and digital

237
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:19,182
experiences. And retailers must listen to consumer preferences and strategically

238
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:22,626
chart and omnichannel courses for added value for

239
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:23,780
the final customer.

240
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,446
Now we come up to some kind of conclusion and

241
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:32,438
I would like to say that going forward,

242
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:36,134
traditional retail's future depends on adaptable and

243
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:39,782
creative brands that keep pace with the consumer's changing

244
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:43,638
needs. Purely physical stores may fade

245
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:47,830
over time, I hope. No, but thoughtfully transformed

246
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,338
spaces can retain relevance. Ultimately,

247
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:54,862
consumers will determine the ideal equilibrium between

248
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:59,034
in person and digital, weighing each channel's

249
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,830
upsides and downsides.

250
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,082
Retail will remain vibrant if retailers

251
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:08,574
listen carefully and chart an omnichannel course

252
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:12,080
that adds some value to the final customer.

253
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,238
