00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,936
Hello everyone, I am Sir Terkiazensola and it

2
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,376
is a pleasure to present this presentation with you

3
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,016
today. When we gather like this, I am

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,296
reminded of the power of connections and the opportunities

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,992
they bring and I introduce myself and

6
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:48,044
share a bit about my journey.

7
00:00:50,624 --> 00:00:54,128
I am an entrepreneur and visioner and lifelong

8
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:57,836
learner. I am always seeking new ways to

9
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,660
innovate and make a positive impact on the world around

10
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:05,492
me. With a background in

11
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:09,412
data engineering, I have had the privilege of working on various

12
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:13,220
projects and collaborating with talented individuals from diverse

13
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:16,364
backgrounds. Throughout my career,

14
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:20,422
I have been driven by a passion for excellence and determination.

15
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,734
Push the boundaries of what is possible.

16
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:28,714
Whether it's building and managing successful startups,

17
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:32,666
mentor inspiring entrepreneurs, or supporting

18
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,814
causes close to my heart,

19
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:39,202
I always strive to make a difference.

20
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:42,946
You may have seen my LinkedIn profile also that I have

21
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,592
been involved in projects related advanced visualization.

22
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:50,300
These experiences have not only shaped my professional

23
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:54,716
journey, but also reinforced my belief and transformative

24
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,904
power of determination, collaboration and innovation.

25
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,956
But beyond the arts and accomplishment, what a truly

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,804
motivates me is the desire to make a meaningful

27
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:10,204
difference in the life of others. I am

28
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:14,248
committed to using my skills and souls for the greater

29
00:02:14,436 --> 00:02:16,896
good, whether it is creating jobs,

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,104
supporting charitable cultures, or empowering

31
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,004
individuals to pursue their passions.

32
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:29,256
As I stand before you today, I am excited about the

33
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,376
possibilities that chance to connect with

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,112
like minded individuals who share my vision

35
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:38,964
for a brighter future.

36
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:44,314
Together, I believe we can overcome challenges

37
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:48,718
and opportunities and create a world where the innovation

38
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:52,326
thrives and everyone has a chance to

39
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,294
succeed. Let's get started with the presentation

40
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:59,514
advanced regulation techniques for complex data

41
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,454
and then my first slide is my introduction.

42
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:06,962
Firstly, today's topics are hypervolt data

43
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:10,610
visualization interactive visualization interactive

44
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:15,014
visualization with the visualization large data set in this combined

45
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:18,214
and data visualization best practices.

46
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:22,722
By the way, the introduction of healing,

47
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:26,826
I want to give importance or benefits with lesion.

48
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,374
For example, the first healing is and has to understand

49
00:03:30,754 --> 00:03:34,946
visual presentation of the data, make complex information

50
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,710
more accessible and understandable. Charts, graphs,

51
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:42,054
maps, provides and clear insights to trends,

52
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:45,034
patterns and relationships between the data,

53
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:49,434
allowing for better cooperation and analysis.

54
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:53,806
But the second, I think is increased engagement.

55
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,294
This means the visualizations are more engaging and

56
00:03:57,374 --> 00:04:00,582
memorable than the raw data and textual

57
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:04,764
information. They capture attention and facilitate

58
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:08,540
the communications leading to the greater engagement and

59
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:11,984
retention of information among the organs.

60
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:16,424
At the third hearing, I mentioned the efficiency of communication.

61
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:21,212
So visualizations serve as a universal

62
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:25,108
language that unscathed barriers such as language

63
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:28,716
and expertise. They enabled efficiency communication of the

64
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,520
couple of ideas. From the fluctuating collaboration at the

65
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:35,656
knowledge sharing among the diverse audiences.

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,044
This is the main item of the efficient of the communication.

67
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:43,376
At 40 there is faster insight I think

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,040
at the visual presentation of the data enable faster

69
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:50,472
insight and understanding compared

70
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:53,496
to traditional data analyzed methods.

71
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,528
With the interactive visualization user can dynamically

72
00:04:57,616 --> 00:05:01,670
explore the data, drill down, drill out into details

73
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:05,382
and gain the real time insights. Is accelerating

74
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,710
the decision making process also and top

75
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:12,198
five heading is storytelling is the most important

76
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:15,862
one. I think all the storytelling is data visualization

77
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,270
allows for the complete storyteller by

78
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:22,234
presenting data in a narrative format.

79
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:25,930
Visualization helps convey the story

80
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:30,042
behind the data, evoke emotions per se,

81
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:33,794
the audiences to take action based on the

82
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,690
insight present. This healing is more important for

83
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:41,058
the time because best practices becomes more

84
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:44,418
important. I am going to the next slide for

85
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:47,334
the types of data visualization.

86
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:52,930
Pie charts, ant histograms, lines, area charts, gantt charts,

87
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:56,370
network diagrams, read diagrams, scatter portals, all are

88
00:05:56,482 --> 00:06:00,418
data visualization types. If you are in process of

89
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:04,386
trying to build a story, persuade a group of people

90
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,346
or better understand your data, consider creating

91
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,434
some sort of visual presentation to guide your truths

92
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:16,106
and truths of the others. So these resolutions

93
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,134
type are become more important to tell this story.

94
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:22,930
What is the most popular one, do you think giving no,

95
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:26,354
not I am giving Bangladesh and pie charts more

96
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:30,274
important terms and the most popular ones

97
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:34,278
elation types, the other forms

98
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:37,862
line graphs at histograms, pivot tables,

99
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:41,438
explodes, scatter plots, radar charts,

100
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:45,894
bubble charts are the other one and

101
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:49,614
so I'm going to my next slide. Interactive isolation

102
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:53,782
refers to used to dynamic user driving feature in the data

103
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:56,766
visualization to facilitate exploration.

104
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,958
Analyzes the understanding of the complex data sets.

105
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:04,814
Some benefits of the interactive visualization focusing

106
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:08,414
on how it enables users to highlight the

107
00:07:08,454 --> 00:07:12,194
keys and explorer may filter the data.

108
00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:16,518
I will mention some important points of manages interactive

109
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:20,120
visualization firstly enhance of

110
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:24,920
the engagement. I think interactive isolations captive users

111
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,832
attention and encourage active participation

112
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:32,944
by allowing them to interact with the data in

113
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:36,480
real time. It's important. I think the

114
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:40,416
second one is the deeper understanding. Users can

115
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,080
roll deeper into a data and gain a better understanding

116
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:48,312
of the pattern's trends and relationships by the interactive

117
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:51,604
exploring different aspects of the datasets.

118
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:55,928
It's an important second important one.

119
00:07:56,096 --> 00:08:00,064
Third one is to customize the insights. Writing interactive

120
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,848
visualization empower users to customize their analyzers.

121
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:07,312
Selecting, filtering and manipulating the data or focus

122
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:10,944
on specific area or interest or regional

123
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:14,584
odds and efficient communication.

124
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,820
It is easier to communicate complex insights

125
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:22,724
by allowing users to interactively explore the data or

126
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:25,824
discover the key files at their own.

127
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:30,780
Also and maybe users alternatively

128
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:34,724
refine their analyzers and hypothesis by dynamically

129
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,324
adjusting visualization parameter,

130
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:41,252
exploring alternative means and testing differing

131
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:44,740
scenarios. Users also actionable

132
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:48,944
decision making by the interactive isolation

133
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:53,348
for the data driven decision is more important making

134
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:57,228
by providing end users with actionable insights

135
00:08:57,276 --> 00:09:00,884
and enabling them to explore various options and outcomes

136
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:01,904
interactively.

137
00:09:03,204 --> 00:09:06,700
Highlights about key insights I'm

138
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:11,076
going to mention for example, interactive visualization allow users

139
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,188
dynamically highlighting key insights by adjusting

140
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:16,984
visual elements such as colors,

141
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:21,884
size, shape or opacity

142
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:25,300
and draw attention to important data points or

143
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:28,820
trends. Users annotation is

144
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:32,580
important also they can add interactive annotations

145
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:36,578
and labels or tooltips having specific data points to the

146
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:40,646
region of the interest to provide context and convey

147
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,558
key insight efficiently. Focused and

148
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:48,342
empathy is another feature that

149
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:52,670
enables users to focus on a specific area of the data by zooming

150
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:56,342
in or zooming out or panning or filtering

151
00:09:56,398 --> 00:10:01,074
out load information, making it easier to identify

152
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:07,254
key findings and enabling user

153
00:10:07,294 --> 00:10:11,502
interaction. Enabling for user interaction

154
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:15,438
is exploring and filtering data, filtering and

155
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:18,990
filtering a section or the interactive isolation allow

156
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:23,278
users to filter and select specific data point category

157
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:26,782
or the time period of the interest, enabling them

158
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:31,168
to focus on relevant subsets of data and

159
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:35,200
also drill down and drill up. Users can drill up

160
00:10:35,272 --> 00:10:39,144
into detailed data on the higher level summary or

161
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,856
lower level summary by interacting with

162
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,456
the heiress or using interactive

163
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,364
navigation controls for this item.

164
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:54,584
Sorting and ranking is more important for the interactivity

165
00:10:54,744 --> 00:10:58,648
feature, cause the enabled users to dynamically sort

166
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:02,480
and run data based on different criteria such

167
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:06,376
as a value or alphabetic order or frequency

168
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,484
or identify the top performer outlier or trends

169
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:15,484
and another shuffling is the exploratory of the analyzers.

170
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:21,544
Interactive visualization support exploratory analyzers by

171
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:25,830
using users to dynamically change isolation time and

172
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:29,766
adjust the parameter. Experiment with the different view

173
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,382
to encourage hidden patterns or relationships in

174
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:36,014
the data. So interactively,

175
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:40,062
isolation empowers users to engage with the data in

176
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:43,798
meaningful ways, enabling them to key insights

177
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:47,334
and highlighting key insights. Explore and filter

178
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:51,354
data efficiently and drive actionable

179
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:55,014
insights and make informed decisions.

180
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:58,994
This interaction islation is most important for

181
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:03,106
the large data sets at the my

182
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:07,614
next slide is main focus on presentation

183
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:12,374
visualization technique for the complex data presentation

184
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:17,738
in our increasing data driven world,

185
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:21,722
the ability make sense of vast amounts of data

186
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:25,530
is paramount for informed decision making

187
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:29,014
and extracting valuable insights.

188
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:33,490
We should devolve into various techniques that enable

189
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:37,698
us to tackle the challenge of the visualizing latch

190
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:41,930
datasets effectively. We should explore

191
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:45,146
how these methods help us distill the complex

192
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,634
data into meaningful presentations. For example,

193
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:53,926
sampling and aggregations are foundational

194
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,654
techniques that allow us to extract relevant

195
00:12:57,774 --> 00:13:00,954
insights from large datasets efficiently.

196
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:05,918
By selecting a subset of data points and combining

197
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:09,134
them into a summary of the statistics, we can

198
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:14,242
capture the results of the entire datasets while reducing

199
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:17,578
the computational overheads and so should

200
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:21,786
think about the reduction of technique

201
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,146
as methods enable us to decrease the volume

202
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,770
of data while retaining essential

203
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:32,174
features. Whether taught the principle

204
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:37,254
of unlike or summarization statistics like

205
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:41,390
medium, we can still fix data

206
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:44,514
here to ocs representation.

207
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:49,834
But what about handling high dimensional data?

208
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:53,278
That is where the data clustering and

209
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,394
dimensionality reduction come into play.

210
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:04,634
That is where the clustering and the dimensional reduction

211
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:09,832
clustering techniques clustering techniques help

212
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:13,644
us group similarity data points

213
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:18,576
together, while your dimensionality reduction

214
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,576
method can enable us to visualization high

215
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,088
dimension model into lower dimensional

216
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:30,048
space. This approach empower crust

217
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:34,724
explorer and understand complex data structure

218
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:39,184
more efficiently. And lastly, I should

219
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:42,888
explore hierarchical and nested with relations that

220
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:46,656
provide a hierarchical view of data and a

221
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,964
low form drilled out exploration. Three maps

222
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:55,408
nested pie charts offer insights

223
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:58,826
into relationships and structure with

224
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,418
the data, enhancing our understanding of

225
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:03,962
complex data sets.

226
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:07,674
Conditioning large

227
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:11,002
data sets requires a multi phase

228
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:15,134
approach by employing techniques

229
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:18,074
such as sampling,

230
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:21,694
aggregation, data reduction, clustering,

231
00:15:22,314 --> 00:15:26,824
dimensional reduction and here are

232
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:32,780
you can unlock valuable insights and

233
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:35,664
drive informed decision making. For this,

234
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:39,984
let's talk about the main subjects of this slide.

235
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:44,904
Sampling the first one is the sample and aggregation technique.

236
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:48,704
And this one this is the first

237
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:54,176
sampling involves selecting a subset of the data

238
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,216
points from a large population to present

239
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,520
the whole. There are various sampling techniques suited

240
00:16:02,592 --> 00:16:06,204
to different type of data and analyze scores.

241
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:10,564
Also random sampling for example involve

242
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:14,872
selecting data points randomly from the population,

243
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:18,688
ensuring that each data point has an equal chance of

244
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:22,300
being selected. Approach is useful.

245
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:25,908
The population is homogeneous and

246
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:29,904
no specific pattern or structure to consider.

247
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:33,980
Strophite sampling, the other

248
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:37,548
hand involves wide population

249
00:16:37,676 --> 00:16:41,052
into distinct structures based on certain

250
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:44,664
characters. For example, age,

251
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:49,010
location and the sampling of each

252
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:53,090
rattle separately approach ensure

253
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:57,854
that each subgroup of population is adequately

254
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:02,098
represented in the sample, making it useful

255
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:05,786
when there significant variation within the

256
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,802
population. Once we have our sample, we can

257
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:13,306
use aggregation technique to summarize the data and

258
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,984
extract meaningful esis. Aggregation involves

259
00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:22,460
combining multiple data points into summary

260
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:26,028
statistics or aggregates.

261
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:29,804
Yes. For example, we can calculate the

262
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:33,556
average count of a certain variable

263
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,380
in the sample to get an overall picture of

264
00:17:37,452 --> 00:17:40,064
its tuition or behavior.

265
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:44,542
Aggregations help us to reduce the complexity

266
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:48,862
of the data while absorbing portal

267
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:52,190
trends and patterns, making it easier to

268
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:55,630
analyze an inter patent. The second

269
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:58,914
one is better reduction at the summarize

270
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:02,758
reduction technique aimed to decrease the volume of

271
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:06,022
that data while retaining its essential

272
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:10,094
features a one common approach to data reduction

273
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:16,824
is dimensionality reduction which involves reducing

274
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:20,104
the number of the variables and features in the data

275
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:23,964
set while preserving its essential structure.

276
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:27,924
Table of two component analysis is a popular

277
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:32,240
dimensional reduction table that identify

278
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,684
the most important assets,

279
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:40,530
variation in the data and x two

280
00:18:40,722 --> 00:18:43,134
and lower dimensional space.

281
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:47,810
Another approach to data reduction is feature

282
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:51,818
selection which involves selecting a subset of

283
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:55,802
the original features that are most relevant to

284
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:59,530
the analyzers and features. Selection methods

285
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:03,074
can be supervised or pansparized depending

286
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:07,856
on the weather can into account target variable

287
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,400
in the data set. Once we have reduced

288
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:15,760
the dimensionality of the data, we can further summarize

289
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:18,968
using various techniques.

290
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:23,120
Summary statistics such as median,

291
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:27,384
standard deviation and percentiles

292
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:31,792
provide insights into breadth

293
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:36,550
and data at histograms

294
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:40,894
box graphical presentation

295
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:45,206
that visualize the distribution of the data and

296
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:50,174
have identity outliers

297
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:54,854
for the data reduction and summarization and

298
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:59,142
the broadband is using data clustering and dimensional

299
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:02,906
reduction. The clustering techniques group

300
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,770
similar data poised together based on their

301
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:11,266
features and attributes. Clustering helps

302
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,186
us identify natural patterns and structures

303
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,906
within the data chats cluster of the customer,

304
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,602
a filler buying behavior for example or clusters

305
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:27,266
of the genes are similar aspiration

306
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,122
profiles. There are various clustering algorithms

307
00:20:31,258 --> 00:20:35,122
including enemies, clustering, error code clustering

308
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:39,162
and dust based clustering each suited to

309
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:42,534
different types of data. After analyzer calls.

310
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:47,578
Dimensional introduction technique transforms the high dimensional

311
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:51,418
data into a lower dimensional representations while

312
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:54,374
preserving its essential structure.

313
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:59,070
These techniques are particularly useful for

314
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:03,790
vision high dimensional data into all

315
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,062
three dimensions making it easier

316
00:21:07,118 --> 00:21:11,102
to explore and interpret place data

317
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:14,798
sets and fourth one

318
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:18,822
kubernetes nested isolation. This represents

319
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:22,558
data in a hierarchical structure where elements

320
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:26,674
are organized into and giant relationship

321
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:31,078
provide a natural way to explore hierarchical

322
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:35,142
data structure. Chance of organizational and

323
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:39,750
maybe lasted categories or sonomist also

324
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:42,194
remaps on board charts.

325
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:46,126
Dandograms plots are examples of the

326
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,746
hierarchical regulation that help us

327
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,370
islamic the relationships between different level of the

328
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:56,986
hierarchy and identity pattern

329
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,474
and also structure within the data nested

330
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:05,090
with display the data within multiple layers of

331
00:22:05,122 --> 00:22:08,946
the nested structures allowing users to explore

332
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,674
relationships at the different level and the different

333
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:16,360
regularity. These visualizations provide a

334
00:22:16,392 --> 00:22:19,840
hierarchical view for the data while enabling drill

335
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:23,984
down and drill down explanation. Nested pie

336
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:27,656
charts, nested bars charts and nested tree maps

337
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,048
are the example of that help

338
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:35,200
us with relating the complex data structure and

339
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:40,164
uncover each size at the different level of the abstraction.

340
00:22:40,574 --> 00:22:43,790
This is the visualization highlights

341
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:48,750
I mentioned. I'm going to go

342
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:54,222
the next slide also and

343
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:58,714
data visualization best practices first

344
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:02,154
healing is your audience.

345
00:23:03,454 --> 00:23:07,094
This is the important one understand

346
00:23:07,434 --> 00:23:10,414
who will be viewing your visualization.

347
00:23:11,194 --> 00:23:14,574
Tailor them to their level of expertise.

348
00:23:16,634 --> 00:23:20,290
Important for practice because you

349
00:23:20,322 --> 00:23:23,746
must know your audience. And the second

350
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,674
one is right visualization tool.

351
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:31,314
Right visualization technique is much more

352
00:23:31,354 --> 00:23:34,850
important after the audience. It is a visualization

353
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:38,170
that efficiently communicate your message

354
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:41,570
and highlight the pattern and trends in

355
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:45,474
your data. Consider factors such

356
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:49,694
as the data type and the message you want to convey.

357
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:54,154
Audiences familiarity with the different visualization types.

358
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:58,034
It's the best choice. And the third one

359
00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:02,212
tell a story interactively and structure

360
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:06,516
your visualization to this story that

361
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,780
has a clear and panic story technical

362
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:14,876
flow maybe a narrative art and to guide

363
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,940
viewers the data at highlighting

364
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:23,444
design is also important and trance of the way

365
00:24:23,604 --> 00:24:28,344
also and the fourth one is simply unclearfy.

366
00:24:28,704 --> 00:24:32,248
And please keep your visualization simple and

367
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:36,440
focused avoiding a cluster and unnecessary

368
00:24:36,512 --> 00:24:42,120
elements. Use clearing labels annotations

369
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:46,524
to help viewers interpret the data accurately

370
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:52,112
and the conclusion of my presentation my

371
00:24:52,168 --> 00:24:55,164
presentation is about me.

372
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,912
At the end of my presentation I

373
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:03,884
have a key takeaways. This is so important

374
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:08,684
clear data for good information.

375
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:13,888
This one and second

376
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:18,216
story storytelling

377
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,956
for the best concept and the third

378
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,284
one is goal and more functionality

379
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:29,516
for the more function based and the third

380
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,944
one is a visual form for

381
00:25:33,284 --> 00:25:36,184
metaphor. For the best metaphor.

382
00:25:37,844 --> 00:25:41,508
These items are the c none of

383
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:44,864
the successful data visualization narratives

384
00:25:45,404 --> 00:25:47,744
aware of these items.

385
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:53,292
As I read our presentation of

386
00:25:53,348 --> 00:25:57,340
advanced isolation techniques important to

387
00:25:57,372 --> 00:26:01,344
recognize that journey is ongoing knowledge

388
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:06,612
and insights gained. Thus the

389
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:11,292
boundaries of the utilizing isolation

390
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:15,654
to unlock the full potential of complexity data sets.

391
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:20,074
Thanks my sincere graduate for engagement

392
00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:24,266
