1
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,374
Only a third of enterprises are realizing their current

2
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:32,262
ambitions. This pessimistic but unsurprising number was

3
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:36,200
published by HFS Research in their market vision paper.

4
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,362
These results came from serving over 500 senior executives

5
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:45,366
across the largest companies in the world. Welcome to

6
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:48,806
Conf 42 Cloud Native Conference and thank you

7
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:52,186
for attending the session. I'm Ashu Siddiqui,

8
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:55,546
senior principal software engineer at Silicon Valley

9
00:00:55,578 --> 00:00:59,390
bank, division of First Citizens bank.

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,534
This talk will be split over three sessions, starting off

11
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:06,818
with cloud reduction framework and why it has to be a

12
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:10,210
starting point for every cloud journey in Azure.

13
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,206
Next section will be azure Landing zone and the key role

14
00:01:14,238 --> 00:01:16,550
it plays in a robust foundation.

15
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,382
The third and last session will be about deployment strategy and

16
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:25,634
how to realize this goal. Cloud Reduction Framework

17
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:29,654
is a comprehensive lifecycle framework to guide organizations

18
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:33,850
to success in their cloud journey. The best practices

19
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,086
aid organization in aligning their technical strategies

20
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:42,042
with the business value. The framework provides

21
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:46,480
distinct phases with specific goals, solutions and benefits.

22
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,880
Strategy starts with the question, why are we moving to cloud?

23
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,406
The multiple motivations vary from

24
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,934
to, but it is imperative that motivations are tightly coupled

25
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:03,506
with the business outcomes. On a broader level, there are

26
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:06,934
three categories of motivations. Number one,

27
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:11,042
critical business events, such as being on the hook to exit

28
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:14,658
data centers or for example, dealing with mergers

29
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:18,214
and acquisitions. Second category of motivation

30
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:21,654
is migration, such as pursuit of cost savings or raising

31
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:25,494
business agility. The third category is innovation,

32
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:29,130
such as scaling to meet market or geographic demands.

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,594
Client phase is about transforming strategy into an actionable

34
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:37,226
plan. The application portfolio needs to be analyzed

35
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:41,870
to determine which apps are suitable for migration or modernization.

36
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,094
In addition, this phase also brings personnel together.

37
00:02:48,142 --> 00:02:51,426
Alignment, in my mind, is one of the most underrated elements of

38
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:55,246
the framework. This is because the program's

39
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:58,946
success is contingent on a vision that must be shared

40
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:02,930
by all the stakeholders. Another key component of this phase

41
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,278
is determining skill readiness. For the

42
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:09,754
people in the trenches to be successful, assessment of the skill set

43
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:12,790
is a requisite to find their gaps.

44
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,902
The identified gaps can be bridged by training and upskilling,

45
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:21,070
which brings the necessary expertise into the organization.

46
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,626
Ready phase requires defining operational models

47
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:29,310
from the three choices of decentralized, centralized or

48
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,914
distributed operations. This phase also

49
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:37,170
includes the highlight of the stock Azure landing zone and its implementation.

50
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,726
Migrate phase provides the best practices for migrating workloads

51
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:45,530
to Azure based on workload assessment.

52
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,314
There are choices to consider rehost aka

53
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:53,830
lift and shift versus refactor versus replatform.

54
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,180
Since a salient purpose of innovation is to drive business value,

55
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,526
what is business value? Needs to be formally and mutually defined

56
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:07,734
by the stakeholders. Building the first minimum

57
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:11,274
viable product MVP and measuring the customer impact

58
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:14,430
are also considerations within the innovation phase.

59
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,610
The significance of secure phase should require no introduction.

60
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:24,142
It is an area that industry trends repeatedly remind

61
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:28,258
requires more and more focus to be able to safeguard enterprise data

62
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:32,558
and intellectual property. While Adafil

63
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:36,242
focuses on getting you into the cloud, online operations

64
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:40,370
is what draws out the business deliverables. Every workload

65
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,054
needs to be managed by its business criticality which focus both on

66
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:47,774
cost and SLAs. Governed phase

67
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:51,446
is an iterative process to ensure application portfolio complies

68
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:55,638
with the corporate and as applicable, any regulatory

69
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:58,970
compliance requirements. In the cloud

70
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,814
space, it seems enterprises struggle with the dual challenge of

71
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:06,350
harnessing innovation while maintaining a robust security

72
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,106
posture. Azure learning zone is the antidote

73
00:05:10,138 --> 00:05:13,970
to this enterprise challenge. It delivers an environment that

74
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,290
adheres to key principles across eight design areas.

75
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,962
Azure billing and entertainent is a first design area and

76
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:27,006
deals with the top two levels of alignment. As depicted

77
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,538
on the slide, it deals with billing and the entertainer

78
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:34,470
that it is encompassed by. Identity and access

79
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,162
management is another critical area that establishes secure access

80
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:41,642
controls. In addition to the focus

81
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:45,354
on authentication and authorization, it also caters to

82
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:49,066
separation of duties. A significant number

83
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:53,750
of enterprises have their own data center, which means hybrid connectivity

84
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,530
will be a requirement, resource organization

85
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,166
plans for how resource will be organized, and the use of

86
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:04,126
consistent patterns in regard to resource naming,

87
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,610
tagging and sufficient designs.

88
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,006
Scope of security transcends into all areas

89
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,002
of the Azure ecosystem, including network

90
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:18,978
and workloads. In addition to industry standards

91
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:22,438
such as NIST, Microsoft provides its own security

92
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:24,630
benchmarks and attestation.

93
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,820
Management is a design area led by cloud Ops team.

94
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,090
It focuses on business alignment and cloud management

95
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,254
through engagements with business stakeholders.

96
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:41,230
SLAs such as RTO and RPO can be agreed upon.

97
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,422
Governance is an iterative process. The team

98
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:48,862
plays an overarching role to focus on enforcement of

99
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:53,074
compliance security requirements. For the last design area,

100
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:57,220
platform automation and DevOps the cloud platform team

101
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,994
drives automation should lead the way for the adoption of

102
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:05,218
infrastructure as code options. One piece of information

103
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:08,998
that will help up to this point is that on a higher level, there are

104
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:13,378
actually two types of landing zone. Platform landing zone centralizes

105
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:17,126
the shared services that are generally considered foundational example,

106
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,566
networking and identity. Application Landing

107
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:24,538
zone is the second type of landing zone and this is where subscriptions for application

108
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:28,422
workloads reside. To create isolation

109
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:32,714
between Internet facing and internal

110
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:35,710
workloads, Microsoft recommends subcategories.

111
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,714
They've chosen the name online for public and corporate.

112
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:44,814
For private workloads, this slide provides visual

113
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:48,254
insight into how Microsoft advocates architecture

114
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,602
for landing zone at the highest level. There are

115
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:55,054
four management groups aside from the first two,

116
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:58,822
platform and application that I've already talked about. The third

117
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:03,590
management group is for subscriptions that are intended to be retired or decommissioned.

118
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,590
The fourth management group is sandbox.

119
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,378
The primary reason for having a dedicated management group

120
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:16,730
is to isolate sandbox subscription from all other types of subscriptions.

121
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,746
To take the conceptual architecture of Azure

122
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:25,230
landing zone to reality, Microsoft provides accelerators.

123
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,706
The accelerator is the most efficient way to implement the landing

124
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:33,550
zone. There are actually three ways to perform the execution

125
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,934
azure portal bicep, which is Microsoft's own

126
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:41,378
domain specific declarative language and the third option being

127
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:44,786
Hashicorp's terraform. Out of the

128
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:48,806
three implementation options, I'll focus in on terraform because as

129
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:52,950
infrastructure as code tool, it is a huge presence in enterprise,

130
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,154
among other reasons. Because enterprises are increasingly heading

131
00:08:57,202 --> 00:09:01,354
towards a multi cloud strategy. To Microsoft credit,

132
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:04,982
they have published modules for the landing zone

133
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:08,918
in Terraform's public registry as well as in GitHub.

134
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:13,054
There is detailed documentation that provides guidance from simple to

135
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:16,682
advanced use cases. For the landing zone, the execution

136
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:20,206
has been done how the landscape looks like

137
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:23,714
I realize this is a busy diagram, so let's focus

138
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:26,610
in on few areas that kind of ties back to the stock.

139
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,700
Notice the four high level management groups, platform,

140
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,182
application decommission and sandbox. Then within

141
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:39,240
platform you have those three shared services,

142
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,630
identity management and connectivity.

143
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,566
For example, in this case, connectivity is doing the hub and

144
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:50,594
spoke model and then you have the identity subscription

145
00:09:50,642 --> 00:09:54,610
here. Similarly, your application workloads reside

146
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,906
under this management group. As depicted

147
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:01,402
here, the subject of cloud reduction

148
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,954
framework and azure landing zone on an enterprise scale

149
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:08,586
is an expensive topic. Given the breadth

150
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:11,850
of this topic, I hope I've been able to give you a condensed flavor.
