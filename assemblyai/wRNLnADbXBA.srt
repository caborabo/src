1
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,632
Today we will discuss quantum computing technology for

2
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:31,304
material science, why material science is

3
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:35,072
important and how can we apply quantum computing

4
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:39,160
technology for material science? In every field

5
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,832
of science, engineering or others we use

6
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:47,120
material science and the quantum computing technology is the

7
00:00:47,232 --> 00:00:51,120
most advanced technology today. And we need to apply

8
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:55,572
in the field of material science and how can we do it?

9
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:59,820
Today we will discuss it. I prepared

10
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:03,980
some slides to presentation about quantum

11
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:07,068
computing technology for material science,

12
00:01:07,236 --> 00:01:10,824
why this is important, why quantum computing technology

13
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:15,744
is the biggest challenge for the material science

14
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:20,424
and how is it works. For the introduction part

15
00:01:20,774 --> 00:01:24,294
prepared the quantum computing technology. I will

16
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,750
give some short information about the

17
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:31,838
quantum computing technology because it is very deep. It is very

18
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:35,474
deep topic about advanced technology,

19
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:39,934
but I will give the short information about that. And after

20
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,206
that we will discuss the power of computing,

21
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,514
how this is, this is how it is, it is

22
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:50,722
possible and how we are used. The qubits or

23
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:54,162
classical computers. What is the difference between classical computers

24
00:01:54,218 --> 00:01:58,058
and the quantum computing and the power of computing

25
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:02,082
is very essential, very important for the material science.

26
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:05,810
And in the main topic, the material science and

27
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:09,794
power of computing, how can we apply this technology

28
00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:14,218
in the material science, how we can change the

29
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:17,482
power of computing in the field of material

30
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,554
science and different industries and

31
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:24,106
studies. I will give some example

32
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,706
about that. And after that, material science

33
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,890
for quantum technology, we design different materials for

34
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:35,314
the quantum computing technology and quantum computing

35
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:39,462
technology will design different materials. It is very

36
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,422
complicated problem for science

37
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:46,702
today, but I will give some sort of

38
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:50,438
information and I will give some brief talk about

39
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:54,766
it. After that we will make a conclusion and

40
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,462
the quantum computing technology. This technology is

41
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,830
the most important scientific discipline of our century and

42
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:05,200
our future. Why I said like that?

43
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:08,264
Because it is the most advanced technology,

44
00:03:08,644 --> 00:03:12,460
because we can achieve the most

45
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:16,588
competing power of competing with the quantum computing technology

46
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:20,908
in the material science. We can design any material.

47
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:24,476
We can make anything with

48
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,444
the quantum computing technology. This technology is the basis of the

49
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:32,090
systems that can achieve high computational capability with the

50
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:36,082
help of qubits. It is very different between the classical computer

51
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:39,658
and the quantum computing because there are many qubits

52
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,306
that are fair position in the qubits, which we

53
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,834
can apply in the games, in the different algorithms,

54
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:50,458
in the quantum computing with the help of the qubits

55
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:54,218
and we can solve many complex problems.

56
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:58,282
Help of the qubits and the inherent parallelism of

57
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:02,376
quantum computing comes from the superposition of qubits.

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,760
This parallelism allows a quantum computer to work on

59
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:11,504
a million computations

60
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:14,880
at once. It's very important because this

61
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:18,632
is the huge amount of computational power

62
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:22,720
of qubits. And we can achieve

63
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:26,400
the thousands of qubits today at the help of

64
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:30,124
IBM, it is very important scientific news.

65
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:34,472
This technology can fulfil high accuracy and computational

66
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:38,008
capability with different algorithms and a completely

67
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:41,592
different concept of information processing. It is very

68
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,784
different to use quantum computing

69
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:48,664
technology in accordance with the information process

70
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:52,558
because you need to design your algorithms,

71
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:56,402
your gates and your problem in

72
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:59,818
this field of competing. In this field of computing.

73
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:03,970
This technology creates its own ecosystems with five

74
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:07,354
different qubit models, different algorithm shapes,

75
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:10,786
problems and solution. As I said before,

76
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,058
this is a new concept and we need to design

77
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:17,818
the material science in this field.

78
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:21,884
And we can achieve anything. We can make anything

79
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:25,304
with help of quantum computing technology

80
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:30,252
and the power of competing. It is the main idea

81
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:34,572
of the quantum computing technology because we

82
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:38,444
can make a solution for the complex problems with

83
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:42,180
help of the power of computing. How we take this

84
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:46,238
power of computing because of there are qubits.

85
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:50,546
This technology brings with it the computational power unimaginable

86
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,074
to mankind because as I said before,

87
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:57,754
we already reach more than 10,000 qubits

88
00:05:57,914 --> 00:06:01,322
due to the IBM arcs. This process

89
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:05,114
capability increases exponentially as two power of

90
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:08,922
n depending on the number of qubits. For example,

91
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:12,642
at 30 qubit quantum computer would equal

92
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:15,954
the processing power of a conventional computer that

93
00:06:15,994 --> 00:06:19,810
could run teraflops, trillions of floating point

94
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:23,914
operations per second. Today's typical desktop

95
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:27,634
computers run at speed measured in gjaflow,

96
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:31,154
billions of floating point of operation. But that

97
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:35,534
amount of power of computing, it is very unimaginable.

98
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:39,336
And how can we use in the material science?

99
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,524
I will show you this image,

100
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:45,444
show the 10,000 qubit processor.

101
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:49,384
Image d wave systems also d wave

102
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:53,580
has a very good work about the

103
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:57,948
quantum computing qubit processor. How can we obtain

104
00:06:57,996 --> 00:07:01,716
the qubits and how can we apply the qubits on

105
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,332
the problem with different algorithms, with the different

106
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:08,846
gains, how can we solve this problem and how

107
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,246
can we apply in industry? Next slides we

108
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,902
will discuss the material science,

109
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,234
how it's related with the qubits.

110
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:22,958
And this is the amount of qubits of IBM different

111
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:26,694
years. We reach more than thousands,

112
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:30,702
more than thousand in last year. It is very important

113
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:35,070
and big news about it, because that

114
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:39,190
amount of qubits gives us the unimaginable

115
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:42,874
calculation capability, power of computing capability

116
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:47,606
and material science. And power of computing in the

117
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,686
material science, defining the specifics of materials,

118
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,870
structure, property, process and characterization are taken

119
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:58,898
into account. We can design all all polymers,

120
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:01,722
all cells are metals.

121
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,786
With the processing performance, structure properties

122
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,682
and characterization values, we can combine them with

123
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:14,194
new materials and achieve high performance materials

124
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:17,250
and very different nanomaterials.

125
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:21,426
And we can obtain different shape of structure,

126
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,932
we can obtain different processes of materials.

127
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:29,724
We can obtain higher performance materials with the change

128
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:34,260
of atomic structure, with the change of molecular arrangement,

129
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:37,860
and with the change of movement of molecules in the

130
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:41,468
polymers. For example, when I give the parameter

131
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:44,988
for the polymers, we can change the moment

132
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:48,572
of the polymer chain, we can change

133
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,424
polymer thermodynamics of the polymer.

134
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:55,056
And how can we improve the process

135
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,604
about this thermodynamic processing?

136
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:03,928
Because there is a huge amount of problems

137
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:07,724
inside of metaverse. This is the power of competing,

138
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:12,248
we can apply, we can make a calculation,

139
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:16,792
we can achieve the more and more high performance

140
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:20,736
materials. Because we have the qubits,

141
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,696
we can solve many problems. It is very important.

142
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,344
Each parameter is carefully selected and combined to determine the

143
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:32,544
performance of the materials. You can make different alloying

144
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:36,384
elements and how can we solve the different kinetics

145
00:09:36,424 --> 00:09:40,200
of materials parameters. We can create a

146
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:43,444
new material and you need to make assimilations.

147
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:47,464
How can you make simulations? You can't

148
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:50,764
even imagine the amount of the problem.

149
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,928
This is why we are using the qubits. This is the power

150
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:58,816
of computing. With the quantum computing technology

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,840
in the material size, we can solve many problems.

152
00:10:02,992 --> 00:10:06,760
In the material size, we can design kinetics of

153
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:10,280
materials, we can make relationships in the

154
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:14,160
thermodynamics process. And this can help us

155
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:17,832
to design our materials thermodynamically,

156
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:22,088
in the atomic structure, in the performance of the materials,

157
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:25,360
in nano parameters or macro parameters.

158
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:29,392
It's very important and there are many different

159
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:33,404
industries and studies about this. The pharmaceutical

160
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:37,882
steel cell companies have devoted a growing share of

161
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:42,254
their net revenues to RD activities, averaging about

162
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:46,274
2020 19% over the past

163
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:50,554
two decades. By comparison, other research intensive

164
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:54,650
industry like software and semiconductors average about

165
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:58,254
15%. This is very important.

166
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:02,872
Pharmaceutical company companies can apply

167
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,760
the material science is the main factor,

168
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,760
why they are applied to quantum computing technology and

169
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:13,648
the power of competing in the pharmaceutical industry and

170
00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:17,360
why we design new semiconductors. How can

171
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:21,484
we do it? Because there are big solution, a big problem

172
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:25,728
inside the atomic structure, thermodynamically and

173
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:29,756
atomic arrangements and many calculations. We need

174
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,064
to solve this problem.

175
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:35,676
Accuracy, accuracy. And you need

176
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,356
to be fast. And that's why the Cubans

177
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,524
help us. And different industries and

178
00:11:43,564 --> 00:11:47,596
studies I will give the pharmaceutical industry and

179
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,556
quantum computing's primary value for pharma lies in research

180
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,028
and development. Disease understrength

181
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,844
development, target finding. This is very important to

182
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:04,076
use quantum computing technology to competing

183
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,444
with power of computing, because this industry

184
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:11,276
is growing very rapidly due to material science. In order to

185
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,044
design materials, collect appropriate data and ensure

186
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:18,636
chemical and physical stability. The big data network must

187
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,868
be analyzed quickly and the right decision must

188
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:25,538
be made. The pharmaceutical industry stands

189
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:29,074
out as the important area where quantum computers

190
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:32,642
and material science are combined. This situation grows

191
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:36,854
even more with financial data and investments instruments.

192
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:40,654
This is very important because in the chemical and

193
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:46,018
physical tests, during chemical and physical tests,

194
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:49,904
there are millions of data according to

195
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:53,664
drugs and crystallization ratio,

196
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:58,444
optimization ratio or anything.

197
00:12:58,564 --> 00:13:02,676
The analysis of the chemical structure. How can we solve

198
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,012
this problem? Easily. And you

199
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:10,508
need to give good decision about the

200
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:14,584
set of industry, because it is very important in us.

201
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:18,612
You need to be very fast. For example,

202
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:21,860
pandemic and the Covid-19 you need

203
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:24,980
to make good drugs. And how

204
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:29,252
can you do that? Because you need to combine many

205
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,116
things in the drugs. And there are four stages

206
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,260
in the pharmaceutical industry to

207
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:40,856
make a good drug. And this is

208
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,400
why we are using this method and the quantum

209
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:48,504
computing technology. And this is very important

210
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:52,880
for this industry. And also there are other industries.

211
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:56,696
For example, semiconductors. As the semiconductor

212
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,760
industry, according to research

213
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:05,124
in the 2000 previous slides. In the previous slides,

214
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,672
you need to grow your crystalline structure in

215
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:13,496
the semiconductors. How can you apply at

216
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,464
the pressure level? The pressure level is important and atomic structure

217
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:20,984
is the most important part. Because the stability of the

218
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:24,984
electrons and the band gap, it's very important. It is

219
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:28,784
another parameters, there are billions parameters

220
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:32,484
and you need to combine these parameters very fast.

221
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:35,964
This is why we are using quantum computing.

222
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:39,696
The pharmaceutical industry is a significant

223
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,560
contributor to the global economy and to health systems and

224
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:47,472
health care across the world. According to data from

225
00:14:47,568 --> 00:14:51,552
IQVIA, revenue in the global pharmaceutical market

226
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:56,768
is estimated to have reached 1480

227
00:14:56,816 --> 00:15:00,082
2 billion American dollars

228
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,274
in 2022.

229
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:06,766
Why the financial growth is important

230
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,302
for the pharmaceutical industry, as there is a

231
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:14,014
Covid-19 and other diseases in the world. And you

232
00:15:14,054 --> 00:15:18,126
need to find a good solution. And how

233
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,474
can we apply the completed power of competing?

234
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:25,798
We need to change. We need to measure the

235
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:29,514
drug crystalline ratio, solubility optimization

236
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:34,750
and product formulations. In the organic product formulations,

237
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:38,462
you need to know the material size and

238
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:42,590
you need to be quick. You need to solve

239
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:46,318
your problem as possible quickly.

240
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:50,198
And that's why you need to apply the computing power of computing,

241
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:53,606
because you need to know solubility optimization.

242
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,854
You need to change ratio of crystallity in accordance with disease.

243
00:15:58,014 --> 00:16:01,742
You need to change product formulations in accordance

244
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:05,062
with body in accordance with disease. You need to

245
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:09,154
be quick. That's why we are using the turbines.

246
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:13,662
And then we need to examine

247
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:17,878
the other side of the other side of science,

248
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:21,954
accordance with material science in the quantum

249
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:25,814
technology. Material science for quantum computing technology

250
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:30,002
and how can we apply the materials in

251
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:34,042
the quantum computing technology. And this is other side of

252
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:38,014
this technology. The electrical properties is

253
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:41,874
one of the most important parameters for the quantum computing

254
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:46,552
technology because you need to obtain good

255
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:49,800
photons. The photon properties is

256
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:53,536
very important in this semiconductor materials.

257
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,016
You need to design your materials, especially two dimensional

258
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,072
materials is important to achieve more and

259
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:04,884
more stable photos.

260
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:09,336
When I continue in the slides, electrical properties of materials

261
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,022
emerge as the most important property for current computers.

262
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:16,706
Different structures and materials groups can exhibit

263
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,634
different electrical properties. It's very important. There are many

264
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:24,370
semiconductors in this field and the

265
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:28,770
different corporations and different industries

266
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:32,362
work with different materials. I will give

267
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,762
a tree of example in

268
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:39,742
the next slides. And especially the evolution of two

269
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:44,046
dimensional materials in terms of photonics is extremely important

270
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,174
for quantum computing. And one of them, one of them quantum

271
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:52,278
that technology and others broadband technology.

272
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,590
It is very important to design the band gap and the quantum

273
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,438
broadband technology is important to design your

274
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:03,654
band gap to take the photos

275
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:07,078
in the, for example, rapid ion system.

276
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,950
It is very important and essential for broadband technology,

277
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:14,878
for bandicap systems, for rapid

278
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:18,646
ion systems. On the other side, quantum dot technology is

279
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,278
very important for the superconducting quantum

280
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:26,758
computing technology. And this is why important because

281
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:30,614
these are different technologies used two dimensional matrix

282
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,810
for the stability of the systems. You need to design

283
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:39,054
your materials in the nanometer scale

284
00:18:40,514 --> 00:18:44,666
as possible as good arrangements and

285
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,866
good appropriate. I said appropriate

286
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,474
electrical characteristics. It is very important to

287
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:56,578
combine different materials for the semi crystalline materials

288
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,260
because you need to. You need to obtain good

289
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:04,716
quality of the photon. And also lifetime is important

290
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,092
because if you take the photons, you need to

291
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:11,572
be processed with this photo. This is the lifetime of

292
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:15,004
the photon, is the ascension and there are some

293
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:17,904
parameters about that. For example,

294
00:19:18,964 --> 00:19:23,316
super competing conductors

295
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,404
materials. In the most important parameters

296
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:31,276
is the operating temperatures. Because the

297
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,584
operating temperature is the source of energy.

298
00:19:36,204 --> 00:19:39,556
It is very important to obtain good operation

299
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,980
temperatures to available systems,

300
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:47,116
to common systems. You need

301
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,984
to achieve for example -100 degrees celsius

302
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:55,848
for the photos. Because the cryogenic temperature

303
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:59,128
is very hard to make operation

304
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:04,764
in the system. Because the cryogenic temperature is

305
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:08,296
waste of time and waste of energy.

306
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,376
A big energy and a big time. It is very important to

307
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,968
obtain cryogenic temperatures for the photos.

308
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:20,582
On the other hand, lifetimes, emission wavelength range

309
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:25,190
and the photon priority and the back gaps of photons is

310
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:29,110
the most important parameters for the photonic characteristics

311
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:32,518
of the materials. Thus, the development of material

312
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:37,314
science directly affects computer technologies and

313
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:41,702
I will give some different materials and data values in

314
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:44,650
terms of photonic properties. For example,

315
00:20:44,762 --> 00:20:47,410
molybdenum, molybdenum sul sulfide,

316
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:50,954
tungstenium and molybdenum d

317
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:53,970
selenium. These are different materials,

318
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:57,602
shows different characteristics, different protonic characteristics.

319
00:20:57,738 --> 00:21:01,418
As shown, the lifetime is too short. This is very

320
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:04,890
important to make a process in the quantum

321
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:08,410
computing technology. You need to achieve to protect

322
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:12,036
your lifetime, your photos to process range.

323
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,716
This is very important to design algorithms

324
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,796
on the quantum computing system because of lifetime.

325
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,940
If you have good lifetime, you can make a processing

326
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:27,744
time. You can have good processing time. It's very important

327
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:31,404
also emission wavelength range is important

328
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,036
to work specific,

329
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,952
specific parameters for the system.

330
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,648
Because every photons have different emission wavelength

331
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:45,352
range and you need to simulate

332
00:21:45,448 --> 00:21:49,440
your system in the field of emission wavelength range.

333
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:54,432
This is very important to work with different semiconductors

334
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:58,056
and also pretty of the photos. I will give

335
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,608
some examples about these materials for our

336
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:05,634
work. The purity of the photon is important to

337
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:09,938
obtain more clear information from the photos.

338
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:13,386
It is also important and the operation temperature.

339
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,334
And I said before, operation temperature is important to apply

340
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:21,802
this technology in

341
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:25,626
the industry because cryogenic temperature is very

342
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,616
hard to obtain that for the industry and

343
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,640
the every field of the life.

344
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:37,016
And you need to obtain good temperature, good operation temperature

345
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,160
to your process, to your system too.

346
00:22:41,312 --> 00:22:45,120
For work. It is very important because temperature is the

347
00:22:45,152 --> 00:22:48,664
cost of energy, mainly cost of energy

348
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:52,080
is the temperature you need to make a good setup

349
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:55,666
about that. And the belly gap is important to

350
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,114
to arrange the electron volts between the

351
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:03,910
minus and phosphine minus and p

352
00:23:03,942 --> 00:23:07,834
type, n for n type. And this is very important and technical

353
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:12,554
issue for the obtain photos

354
00:23:13,254 --> 00:23:17,326
in this field of quantum technology. And when

355
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,046
I make a summarize in the summary, a quantum

356
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,710
computing technology have been used to determine the critical properties of

357
00:23:24,742 --> 00:23:29,002
magic. This has had a direct impact on the development of

358
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:33,162
high performance materials, especially in the pharmaceutical

359
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:36,946
industry. As I said before, the pharmaceutical industry

360
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:42,938
in the financial is the most important area which

361
00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:47,546
depends on the quantum computing technology. Because as

362
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,994
you remember, the solution ratio of crystalline solubility

363
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:55,892
and formulation are very

364
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:59,116
important parameters. You need to be quick about that.

365
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,828
You need to gain good accuracy about that. In the pharmaceutical

366
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:07,380
industry, the use of quantum computing technology has become widespread

367
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:11,100
for processes that develop high computational technology such

368
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:14,624
as finding the solubility ratio and appropriate dosage.

369
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:19,044
Today, the number of qubits has exceeded 10,000 by

370
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:22,528
ibms is very important. Will you achieve

371
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:26,344
advanced technology? There are many sectors

372
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:29,904
and there are many cooperation in this

373
00:24:29,944 --> 00:24:33,864
field. And this number is increasing by day by

374
00:24:34,024 --> 00:24:37,472
in order to increase this number, different materials have started to

375
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:41,488
be developed in terms of photonics. The photonics

376
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:44,856
is the main section for

377
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,076
the material size for the quantum computing technology or

378
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,436
photo technically developed materials, values such as operating

379
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,824
temperature, band gap and pretty of the photon are very important.

380
00:24:56,124 --> 00:25:00,660
Why we are using these are factors and I

381
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:04,188
discussed, and these are parameters, these are technic

382
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,524
parameters, and I don't give any

383
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:11,316
technical information about that, but it's a little

384
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,204
bit short talk and I'm very happy to discuss

385
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:18,940
these parameters with you. All the factors within the

386
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:22,588
ecosystem, material science, quantum computer technologies,

387
00:25:22,676 --> 00:25:26,316
and the growing industries connected to them are growing in

388
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,544
terms of financial and usage areas. As I said before,

389
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:34,188
we are going to quantum

390
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:37,104
age with the material size.

391
00:25:38,024 --> 00:25:41,856
How can we apply the material science in the quantum copy

392
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,000
technology and on the other side, quantum copy technology

393
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:49,336
for the material science, these are parameters,

394
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,204
is essential for the quantum age.

395
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:56,128
These are parameters, photonic behavior,

396
00:25:56,256 --> 00:26:00,392
two dimensional materials, pharmaceutical industry, and also

397
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:04,350
high performance materials. They are related with the information

398
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,934
technology. Maybe next day,

399
00:26:08,014 --> 00:26:12,034
maybe next day, on the next year, we need to obtain

400
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:16,198
more than thousands qubits because our

401
00:26:16,246 --> 00:26:20,214
problems getting complex and we need to solve

402
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:24,238
this in the field of the size. And I just want to

403
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:27,542
say thank you about presentation

404
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:29,454
and thank you for us.
