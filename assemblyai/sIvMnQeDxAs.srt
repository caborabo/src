00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,770
I am Sena. I am AWS Security Hero

2
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,274
and senior cloud security engineer at Lirabar Studio.

3
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:35,814
If you want to connect with me, you can

4
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:39,766
use my LinkedIn, my Twitter and my medium account.

5
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:43,320
Today we are going to talk about cloud security,

6
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,354
securing the sky strategies for protecting

7
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:51,200
against cloud hacking let's get started.

8
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,294
First of all, we can start with why cloud security is

9
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:59,850
so complicated and a nightmare for developers and DevOps engineers.

10
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,150
First of all, there are lots of cloud providers in the market.

11
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,994
Sometimes we struggle to choose which cloud provider is good and

12
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:10,706
fit for us. In these providers there are lots of services

13
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:13,538
that we need to learn and effectively use.

14
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:17,842
Secondly, there are lots of product requirements

15
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:21,526
in our company. We need to choose what is the best solution for

16
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:25,494
us, what is the best solution for us

17
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:29,882
to integrate the security with them. Product requirements can change

18
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:34,342
quickly, so sometimes it's hard to detect security requirements

19
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:37,370
and threat management between these product requirements.

20
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,486
On the other side, actually, we all know there is a

21
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:44,762
shared responsibility model for the cloud providers.

22
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:48,382
Securing in the cloud and security of the cloud are

23
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:52,218
the cloud terms are really important for us.

24
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,762
Sometimes companies want to know what responsibilities they have

25
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,266
and sometimes it can

26
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:02,834
be complicated, analyze it all and get the best

27
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:06,706
explanation. In addition to all of

28
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:10,614
this, there are lots of cloud resources we need

29
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:14,246
to use right now.

30
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:17,506
You are going to use and you

31
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:20,614
have lots of cloud resources in your cloud environment.

32
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:25,078
You need to analyze all of them like unused resources,

33
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:28,506
used resources that you need to remediate security

34
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:32,160
findings. And this is a challenge for us.

35
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,122
Depending on cloud resources, there are lots of attack surfaces

36
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:39,360
in the cloud. We need to aware all of these.

37
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,206
Like there are lots of endpoints, network environments,

38
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,378
databases, AI services, iot services,

39
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:51,250
blah blah. Attackers love using different attack

40
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,914
surfaces, even if you don't know. And for the

41
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:58,566
last one, there are lots of tools. We have lots of different tools and

42
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:02,806
lack of experience in the cloud security. Sometimes companies

43
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:07,586
get lots of tools to use, check the cloud security installs

44
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:11,274
and configure them, and after that forget them. It's not

45
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:14,762
the best way to protect the cloud. We need to know

46
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,426
and use these tools and protect ourselves from

47
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,774
the attackers. So we love

48
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:25,194
the cloud, so attackers do. In this slide,

49
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:28,494
there are some

50
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:32,160
analytics about cloud security. It's from the Orca security report.

51
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,106
Thanks to them for this. If you

52
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:40,994
want to read them detail, you can see the

53
00:03:41,032 --> 00:03:44,718
report in their site. So there is a

54
00:03:44,904 --> 00:03:48,914
91% of organizations

55
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:53,286
have at least one vulnerability older than ten years and

56
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:57,174
46% of

57
00:03:57,212 --> 00:04:01,082
organizations have a vulnerability more

58
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:04,774
than 20 years old. So it's

59
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:07,754
important so what does it mean?

60
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:11,834
It means we have lots of environment, we have lots of vulnerabilities

61
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:15,850
and we have lots of old vulnerabilities and new vulnerabilities

62
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,554
that we need to remediate. On the other side, there is analytics

63
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:22,670
about the cloud malware attacks.

64
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,702
So 38% of the cloud malware

65
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,446
attacks are known the Trojans and for the malware

66
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:34,446
by asset type we can see container storage bucket

67
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,666
and the virtual machine. And these asset types

68
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:41,378
are the most usage

69
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:45,880
of the cloud. So we need to

70
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,862
get a plan for this, for the containers,

71
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:53,126
for the storage bucket and for the virtual machine,

72
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:57,180
and the last one for the log for shell. You can see the

73
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,022
numbers from it. Log four shell and the log

74
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:05,374
4G are

75
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:09,482
some exploits in the recent years. So I can easily

76
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:14,434
say it's important to protect the cloud with

77
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:15,380
these numbers.

78
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,906
For the recommendations and

79
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,446
some points that we need to

80
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:28,950
share, we can start with do not use

81
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,470
public resources unless you really really need.

82
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,466
What does it mean for your storage resources, for your container

83
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:40,406
registries, for your publicly accessible databases,

84
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:43,974
for your AI notebooks like Amazon Sagemaker?

85
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:47,062
Please do not use public resources,

86
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:50,894
publicly accessible resources unless you really really need.

87
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:55,326
What does it mean really need? Like if

88
00:05:55,348 --> 00:06:00,106
you have a static website and if you have some publicly accessible photos

89
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:03,780
in your website, it's fine to share

90
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,430
in the s three bucket publicly.

91
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,894
There is no issue in here. But if you have some public resources

92
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:16,322
in the s three and some attacker

93
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:20,386
can write on it, it's a problem or destroy

94
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:24,102
on it, it's another problem. Or maybe there is some large

95
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:28,054
files in the S three that is publicly

96
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:31,578
accessible. It's also a problem for the denial of

97
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:35,194
wallet amplification attack. And also if you have

98
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:39,238
some publicly accessible databases and publicly notebooks,

99
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:43,518
it's also a problem. They are also a problem because

100
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:46,766
we don't want to databases can publicly accessible and we

101
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:50,430
don't want someone use our AI

102
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,210
notebooks, Amazon sagemaker models in

103
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,822
our AWS account. So the publicly accessible

104
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,634
resources we do

105
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:07,042
not use publicly accessible resources is the number

106
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:10,946
one recommendation from me for

107
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:14,998
the two. Be aware of resources. Yes. It's also important

108
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:18,474
which resources, where and why? We need to answer these

109
00:07:18,512 --> 00:07:23,174
questions, how your architecture

110
00:07:23,222 --> 00:07:26,586
is designed. There are lots of resources and there are

111
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:30,486
lots of like in the AWS. There are lots of maybe

112
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:34,254
regions, maybe different AWS accounts. And we

113
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:37,466
need to know and be aware of our resources

114
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:41,882
and what are the possible vulnerabilities on it. Like your EC two ECs

115
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:45,140
AWs environment that I mentioned.

116
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,666
Maybe you have lots of vulnerabilities in

117
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:55,398
your environment and you need to all of them. You need to know all

118
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:59,442
of them. So what are the misconfigurations in your cloud resources?

119
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:03,362
Like unused access keys, like publicly accessible

120
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:07,234
s, three buckets, like cloud trail

121
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:09,660
that aren't enabled yet.

122
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,790
All of it are the misconfigurations.

123
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,418
And we need to follow and aware and check

124
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:22,906
all misconfigurations, maybe daily, weekly or monthly,

125
00:08:22,938 --> 00:08:25,760
I don't know. It depends on your company.

126
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,110
And what are the endpoints? For the endpoints, there are lots of endpoints

127
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,526
like EIB endpoints, like lambda

128
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:35,490
functions,

129
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,570
like API gateway endpoints. I don't know if

130
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,866
an endpoint is an external, this is an issue for us and this

131
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:48,482
is an attack surface for the attackers.

132
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:52,274
So you need to know what the endpoints

133
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:56,760
are and they are vulnerable or not.

134
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,398
And for the awareness. Actually there are lots

135
00:09:01,414 --> 00:09:05,654
of tools in the CSPM cloud security posture management.

136
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:10,066
CSPM, it's not enough, but it's a good start for your posture

137
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:13,434
management. Like you can get your security posture

138
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:17,214
score, you can get general visibility of your

139
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:20,430
cloud environment. Like for the CIS benchmark,

140
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,980
what are my paths, what are my fails for

141
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,578
cis Azure benchmark, what are my failed ones

142
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:32,654
and what should I need to remediate

143
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:36,066
them? This is a good start, but it's

144
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:40,246
not enough. We need to do

145
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:43,400
lots of work to protect our cloud.

146
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,834
So for the other one, please read the documentation. I know

147
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:52,346
that reading the documentation can be challenging and unwanted stuff

148
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:55,654
for developers, for sometimes the security engineers,

149
00:09:55,702 --> 00:09:59,922
but it's so important. Following the documentation ensures

150
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:03,706
that security features are configured and configured correctly.

151
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:07,626
And sometimes there are some additional security features

152
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:11,854
in the documentation and if we don't know it,

153
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:16,338
we cannot enable it. So reading the documentation is

154
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:20,414
very important in this point. And maximizing protection

155
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:24,050
against threats, again, maximizing protection against

156
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,702
threats is important for us.

157
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:31,554
And the cloud engineers are updated on the Neve security features.

158
00:10:31,602 --> 00:10:35,330
Yes, that's why I'm saying and best practices

159
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,006
and maximizing the use of documentation minimizes

160
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:43,354
reliance of external support, saving time and

161
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:47,782
for your resources. So please read the documentation

162
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:51,594
whenever you see an AWS service, Azure service,

163
00:10:51,712 --> 00:10:54,000
whenever see a security service,

164
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,870
maybe compute service, database service,

165
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,374
it's so important. Yes. The other

166
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:05,214
one get alerted from everything you need. Alerting is most important

167
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,882
in the most important thing in the cloud I think,

168
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:12,462
because there can be lots of anomalies

169
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:16,614
in your AWS account, in your Azure environment, whatever you

170
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:20,760
are going to use. And there are always

171
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,390
some class resource threats.

172
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,522
There are always cloud resources, configurations,

173
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:33,590
chains, and we need to follow all of it. Like what are your anomalies?

174
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,906
What are your cloud resources threats? What are

175
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,910
your configuration chains? Like if someone,

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,262
if an attacker gets in your AWS account

177
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:47,370
and creates a new IM user for herself

178
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,514
or himself, it's very dangerous

179
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:54,942
for us and we need to be aware of it. So we need to get

180
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:59,170
alerts from everything we need. And also getting

181
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,562
alerts is an issue. But after getting

182
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:06,374
the alerts, we need to have a plan for the alerts is another issue.

183
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,454
Yes, we got lots of alerts. And if we do

184
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:13,510
not analyze them, it's another

185
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,774
issue because every alert should be

186
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:20,778
analyzed deep dive. And if someone or

187
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:23,926
something is bad on your cloud environment,

188
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:27,850
you need to be aware of it. With these cool

189
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,738
alerts, even if false positive alerts, you need to analyze

190
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:35,278
all of it. And with the alerts we need

191
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:38,414
to monitor everything. Yes, I am sure you know

192
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:42,254
it, but again, I want to say

193
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:45,554
it, we need to monitor everything because the

194
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:49,506
constant monitoring enables early detection and suspicious activities or

195
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:51,970
anomalies in our cloud environment.

196
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,754
And the timely monitoring allows for rapid

197
00:12:56,802 --> 00:13:00,374
response to security incidents like there is some

198
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:04,166
anomalies in it. And if we monitor it, there is

199
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:07,910
a fast solution for this security incident.

200
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,414
And also monitoring provides valuable insights

201
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:14,886
into emerging threats and attack patterns.

202
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:18,550
And also monitoring some resources

203
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,634
helps control the cost anomalies and prevention

204
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:26,222
of unnecessary expenses. So it's important to

205
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:30,174
monitor everything. So the encryption we

206
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:33,970
know the encryption we need to encrypt everything. We need to

207
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,362
dance like no one is watching. Encrypt like everyone is.

208
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,802
Encryption in transit is number one,

209
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:44,542
encryption in rest is number one. Following the best practices

210
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:48,166
in the encryption usage encryption stage like what is the

211
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:51,554
best encryption key for the asymmetric encryption?

212
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:55,398
What is the best TLS version for my

213
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:59,066
HTTPs on the Erb? Like we need

214
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,902
to follow the best practice for it and also follow up the cybersecurity

215
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:07,320
work for encryption changes like TLS 100 and

216
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,770
zero is not secure anymore. SSL version

217
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,800
two is not secure anymore, something like that.

218
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,114
Follow up cybersecurity word for encryption changes helps

219
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:22,286
for us and the other stuff be

220
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:25,634
open to change. I love this phrase. So I

221
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:29,582
want to add in my presentation the most dangerous phrase

222
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:33,794
in English languages. We always done it

223
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:37,878
this way. This is the best dangerous phrase because yes,

224
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:42,200
you have always done in this web and

225
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,294
it's the most dangerous thing in your cloud environment. So it's

226
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:51,962
important to be open to change open.

227
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:56,102
Maybe you need to change all architecture,

228
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,350
maybe you need to change your containers,

229
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,078
maybe you need to change the code, I don't know,

230
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:06,670
but it's important to be open to change and please

231
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,254
do not use a phrase like, we have always done it this

232
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:13,710
way and we didn't hack

233
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,210
for ten years, so why do we need to change it?

234
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,610
It's too dangerous. Please do not use and always

235
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,742
be open to change for everything, for your architecture, for your

236
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:30,040
code, maybe for your team, I don't know.

237
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,094
It's important point for the cloud security and

238
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:41,494
also for the teams. I believe you shouldn't isolate

239
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:45,466
teams because everyone needs the security, marketing needs of security.

240
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:48,938
Cloud security needs to security developer needs the security

241
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:53,086
and each team brings unique skills and perspectives to

242
00:15:53,108 --> 00:15:56,686
the table. And if we do

243
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:00,782
not isolate the teams, this improves the visibility across

244
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:04,078
teams and helps identify and address security risks

245
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:07,922
more efficiently. Maybe some developer knows about

246
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:11,906
the architectural, maybe some architects in your team

247
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:15,220
knows about the security stuff in your EC two.

248
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,414
And if you

249
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:23,106
don't isolate teams, it can be very helpful to solve

250
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:27,160
things, to mitigate things, and to

251
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,190
find a solution for the security incident.

252
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,854
And also it avoids the duplication

253
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:38,810
of efforts and resources, because if

254
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,606
one team looks at a vulnerability, for example,

255
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:47,070
if different teams isolated different teams,

256
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,238
different teams analyzes the same vulnerability, it's a

257
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,886
duplication. And for the efforts and for the resources, we don't

258
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:59,314
want that. So please do not isolate teams in your

259
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,434
company. And the last

260
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:06,386
one, think what if. As a security professionals, we always

261
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,942
think what if, what if I get hacked? What if

262
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:13,334
someone gets my credentials from

263
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:17,154
here? Think what if an attacker

264
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,730
gets here and do this and do this after do this and after

265
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,042
do this, what should I do? Considering the

266
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:27,402
potential scenarios in their impacts on the cloud

267
00:17:27,456 --> 00:17:31,674
security posture and identify the vulnerabilities and weaknesses

268
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:35,374
before they can be exploited. Always think like

269
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:39,002
what if scenarios. Dive ongoing security enhancements

270
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:42,538
and updates with your team. Like do

271
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:45,714
not isolate teams and think always what if.

272
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:49,986
And after that, I think with these

273
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,410
recommendations,

274
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,310
with this to do list, I think you can protect

275
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,600
your cloud environments from the attacks and

276
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,686
you can increase your visibility in

277
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:11,478
your cloud environment. So that's it for

278
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:14,600
my session. Thank you for joining me today.

279
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,394

280
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:20,942
