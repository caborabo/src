1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,322
I'm nitish and I'm thrilled to be presenting on the topic.

2
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:31,258
Crafting adaptive user experiences a multidisciplinary

3
00:00:31,346 --> 00:00:35,082
approach to responsive web components with our

4
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:39,098
background in web development and user experience design, I have dedicated

5
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:43,498
my career to creating seamless and dynamic online interactions

6
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:47,234
that cater to a wide range of devices and user needs.

7
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:51,018
Today, we'll deep dive into the principles,

8
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:55,448
practices and technologies that can help us achieve truly

9
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:59,752
responsive and user centric web components in

10
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,280
our multi device world. Creating web components that

11
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:07,400
automatically adjust to diverse contexts like mobile,

12
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:10,896
desktop and embedded systems, is crucial for

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,512
delivering seamless user experiences. This presentation

14
00:01:14,568 --> 00:01:18,288
explores a multidisciplinary approach to designing

15
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:22,166
reusable UI modules that dynamically adopt.

16
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,958
We leverage modern web technologies such as semantic HTML

17
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:29,614
five, CSS three, and JavaScript to optimize visual

18
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:33,430
hierarchy, information density and layout capabilities across

19
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:37,750
devices and networks. Let's consider why responsiveness is

20
00:01:37,782 --> 00:01:41,886
so vital. Users now access websites on a plethora

21
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,950
of devices, from smartphones and tablets to desktops

22
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:50,742
and smart tvs. Each device offers a different experiences

23
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:55,034
based on screen size, resolution and user interaction methods.

24
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,854
A responsive design ensures that no matter what device

25
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:02,286
a user is on, they have a smooth and engaging

26
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,590
experience. This isn't just about scaling images

27
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:10,678
or changing font sizes, it's about rethinking how

28
00:02:10,726 --> 00:02:13,594
content is delivered and interacted with.

29
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:17,674
We'll also discuss the evolution of web design.

30
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:22,038
Back in the early days of the web, designers created separate

31
00:02:22,086 --> 00:02:24,554
versions of websites for different devices.

32
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:29,702
However, this approach quickly became unsustainable.

33
00:02:29,838 --> 00:02:32,274
As the number of devices types grows,

34
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:37,086
responsive design emerged as a solution, allowing a

35
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,074
single codebase to adapt to various screen sizes and orientations.

36
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:45,786
This evolution highlights the importance of adaptability

37
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,186
in web development. Responsive design principles are

38
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,698
foundational to our approach. By focusing on visual hierarchy

39
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:57,050
and optimizing information density, we can ensure that

40
00:02:57,082 --> 00:03:00,814
our design remains clear and effective across different devices.

41
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:04,922
Layout APIs like Flexbox and CSS grid

42
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:08,814
enable us to create flexible and accept adaptable layouts.

43
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:13,366
Declarative responsive designs use media queries

44
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,894
to apply different styles based on characteristics like

45
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:20,174
Viewport width, which helps keep content

46
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:23,234
accessible and optimizing it for each context,

47
00:03:23,814 --> 00:03:27,262
let's delve into visual hierarchy. This principle

48
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:30,454
involves structuring content so that the most important

49
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:33,822
elements are prioritized visually. Techniques like using

50
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,376
larger fonts for headlines, contrasting colors,

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,624
and strategic white space can guide the user's

52
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:42,884
eye to key information. First,

53
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:46,704
Flexbox and CSS grid come into play by allowing

54
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:51,000
us to create complex responsive layouts. These tools

55
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:54,648
provide powerful methods for distributing space and aligning

56
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:59,400
items, making our designs adaptable with

57
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:03,942
sacrificing aesthetics or functionality. Another aspect

58
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,990
is the use of media queries. Media queries enable us

59
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:12,374
to apply different CSS rules based on device characterizations

60
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:15,766
such as width, height, orientation,

61
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,366
and resolution. This allows us to create

62
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,074
a single style sheet that adapts to various devices

63
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:27,274
rather than having to write separate style sheets for each one.

64
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:30,970
This not only simplifies maintenance, but also

65
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:34,258
ensures a consistent look and feel across all

66
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:37,874
platforms. We can also discuss the

67
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:41,298
importance of fluid grids. Unlike fixed grids

68
00:04:41,426 --> 00:04:45,106
that use set pixel values, fluid grids use relative

69
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,130
units like percentages, which scale seamlessly

70
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:52,698
with different screen sizes. The approach allows

71
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:56,218
our layouts to adjust smoothly, providing a more cohesive

72
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:59,946
and user friendly experience. Maintaining power and

73
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,414
accessibility standards is critical.

74
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:07,282
Studies have shown that responsive modules load 37% faster

75
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:11,466
than their non responsive counterparts, underscoring the

76
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,770
importance of performance optimization. We'll discuss

77
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:19,254
how to balance visual adjustments with usability,

78
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:23,486
ensuring interfaces conform to accessibility standards

79
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,954
like WCAG across various contexts.

80
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:30,974
Performance is key to user intervention. Slow loading pages

81
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:34,994
can frustrate users and leads to higher bounce rates.

82
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:38,814
Techniques such as image optimization, lazy loading,

83
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:42,174
and minifying CSS and JavaScript can significantly enhance

84
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:45,662
load times. Using modern image formats

85
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:49,230
like Webp can reduce file sizes without compromising

86
00:05:49,302 --> 00:05:52,380
quality. Lazy loading defers the loading

87
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:56,044
of non critical resources until they are needed, improving initial load

88
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:59,684
times accessibility ensures that our designs are

89
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:02,908
usable by everyone, including people

90
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:06,300
with disabilities. This involves using semantic

91
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:10,140
HTML elements, which provide meaningful context to

92
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:13,684
screen readers and ensuring sufficient color contrast

93
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:15,984
for users with visual impairments.

94
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:20,452
Implementing ARIA attributes can also help

95
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:24,064
make dynamic content more accessible. For example,

96
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:28,364
ensuring that all interactive elements like buttons and links are

97
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:31,764
keyboard navigable is essential for users who rely on

98
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:34,948
assistive technologies. To illustrate,

99
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:39,584
consider a case study where a website redesign incorporated these principles

100
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:43,802
by optimizing images, reducing the number of HTTP

101
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:47,178
requests, and improving code efficiency. The website's

102
00:06:47,226 --> 00:06:50,414
load time is reduced by 50%.

103
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:54,410
Additionally, implementing ARIA roles and improving color

104
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:58,434
contrast resulted in the 30% increase in accessibility

105
00:06:58,514 --> 00:07:02,074
compliance, making the site more inclusive for all

106
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:05,802
users. Mobile accounted for 67%

107
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,894
of global online traffic by 2021,

108
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:13,118
highlighting the importance of responsive design. Nearly 60%

109
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,774
of developer teams now prioritize responsive design to

110
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:21,094
boost revenue and retention. A mobile first approach considers

111
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:23,194
constraints like smaller viewports,

112
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:26,774
creating lean performance experiences that scale

113
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:30,470
up seamlessly. Designing with a mobile first mindset

114
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:34,710
means starting with the smallest screens and progressively enhancing the

115
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:38,514
experience for larger screens. This approach ensures

116
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:41,898
that the essential content and functionality are accessible on

117
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:45,146
all devices. It encourages simplicity

118
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,650
and efficiency, which are critical for performance on

119
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:52,330
mobile networks. For instance, mobile first design

120
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:56,374
might prioritize essential navigation and content upfront,

121
00:07:56,674 --> 00:08:00,234
ensuring that users on slower connections can access

122
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,974
the most important information quickly.

123
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:07,458
A mobile first approach often leads to cleaner, more focused designs.

124
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:11,266
By addressing the limitations of mobile devices first, such as

125
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,122
smaller screen sizes and touch base navigation, we create a

126
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:18,214
strong foundation that can be expanded for larger screens.

127
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:22,754
The result is a more cohesive and user friendly experiences

128
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:26,610
across all devices. We can also consider real

129
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:30,314
world application. For example, a popular e commerce site

130
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:33,930
implemented a mobile first redesign resulting in a 20%

131
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:36,654
increase in mobile conversion rates.

132
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:40,674
By focusing on mobile usability, they were able to create a

133
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:44,050
streamlined shopping experience that created the users

134
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:47,374
on the go, ultimately boosting overall sales.

135
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:51,490
Achieving responsive universal web experiences

136
00:08:51,562 --> 00:08:55,742
requires architectural shifts from client side scripting to universal delivery,

137
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:59,030
augmented by progressively improved server rendered

138
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:03,214
structures. These shifts aligned with modern web developments,

139
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,518
increasing use of reusable components delivered efficiently

140
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:10,886
across contexts. Modern web development

141
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,014
trends such as server side rendering and static site generation are

142
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,726
becoming more popular. SSR generates HTML

143
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,150
on the server for each request, ensuring faster load times and

144
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:25,268
better search engine optimization. SSG,

145
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:29,036
on the other hand, generates HTML at build time, which can

146
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,740
be served quickly by a CDN. Both apertures help

147
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:36,484
in delivering content efficiently, reducing the

148
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:40,224
reliance on client side JavaScript, which can be a performance bottleneck.

149
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:44,484
Using frameworks like React, Vue or angular with tools like next

150
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:48,116
js or next js can facilitate these architectural

151
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,252
shifts. These frameworks allow us to build reusable components

152
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:56,108
that can be rendered on the server or at build, improving both

153
00:09:56,156 --> 00:10:00,100
performance and maintainability. By adopting these modern

154
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,948
practices, we ensure that our application are scalable,

155
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:08,184
fast and reliable. To put this into perspective,

156
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:12,744
consider a large news website that adopted server side rendering.

157
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:16,068
By delivering pre rendered pages from the server,

158
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,744
they significantly improve their load times and search engine rankings.

159
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:23,328
This architectural shift not only enhanced

160
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:27,032
user experience, but also increased organic traffic

161
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:30,752
by 25%. Incorporating usability

162
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:34,792
research and usage analytics is key to elevating fragmented

163
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:38,328
experiences into cohesive ones adopted for each

164
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:42,392
form factor, a user centered process identifies

165
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:46,392
pain points and crafts unified interfaces compatible

166
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:50,040
with the full range of context users users

167
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:53,816
encounter. User centered design focuses on

168
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,960
the needs of preferences and limitations of end

169
00:10:56,992 --> 00:11:01,352
users at every stage of the design process. This involves

170
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:04,344
conducting user research such as interviews,

171
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:07,856
surveys, and usability testing to gather

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,976
insights into user behavior and preferences.

173
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,568
By understanding how users interact with our designs,

174
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:18,544
we can create more intuitive and satisfying experiences.

175
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:23,184
Usage analytics also play a crucial role in UCD

176
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,420
tools like Google Analytics, Hardjar and Crazy egg

177
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:30,660
provide valuable data on user behavior such

178
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:34,220
as where user click, how they navigate through a site,

179
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:38,028
where they drop out. This data helps identify area

180
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:42,088
of improvement and validate design decisions. For example,

181
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:46,224
if analytics show that users are frequently abandoning a form

182
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:49,856
halfway through, it might indicate a need to simplify the

183
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,376
form or provide better guidance. A case study on a

184
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,760
travel booking site illustrates the impact of user case user

185
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:01,124
centered design. By conducting user research,

186
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:05,344
they discovered that users found the booking process confusing

187
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:08,848
and cumbersome. Through iterative testing and redesign,

188
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,916
they simplified the process, resulting in a 40% increase in

189
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,344
completed bookings and significantly higher user satisfaction scores.

190
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:21,364
While being flexible. Consistent guidelines balance

191
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:24,900
stability will cover emerging best practices

192
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:29,344
for planning, developing, and maintaining responsive components and systems.

193
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:33,468
These actionable insights aid business in

194
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:37,364
creating resilient, dynamic web experiences that provide value

195
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:41,256
long term. The best practices to adopt a design

196
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,840
system a design system is a collection of reusable

197
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:48,264
components guided by clear standards that can

198
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:51,004
be assembled to build any number of applications.

199
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:55,512
Design systems promote consistency and efficiency,

200
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:59,192
making it easier to maintain and scale your design across different

201
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:03,360
projects. Example of popular design system includes Google's

202
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:06,614
material design, IBM's carbon design system.

203
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:11,134
Another best practice is to ensure cross browser compatibility.

204
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:15,098
Despite the prevalence of modern browsers, users may still

205
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:18,882
access your site using older versions or different browsers.

206
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:22,730
Using tools like browser stack or cross browser testing, you can

207
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:26,194
test your designs across a wide range of browsers and

208
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:29,134
devices to ensure a consistent experience.

209
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:34,310
Performance optimization optimization should be an ongoing effort.

210
00:13:34,502 --> 00:13:38,158
Regularly audit your site with tools like Lighthouse or webpage

211
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:41,750
test to identify performance bottlenecks and opportunities for

212
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:45,486
improvement. Implementing techniques such as code

213
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,486
splitting, where only the necessary code is loaded for

214
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,754
a given page, can also enhance performance.

215
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:56,038
A real world example of best practice in action is a major financial

216
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,350
service company that implemented a design system.

217
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:03,334
By standardizing their component and guidelines, they were able

218
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:07,038
to reduce development time by 30% and maintain a consistent user

219
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:10,774
experience across all their various platforms

220
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:14,726
and services. This approach, combining recent

221
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,694
web specification advances with user centered design principles,

222
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,318
unlocks transformative potential for crafting strong online

223
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:25,682
presence. Embracing it empowers us to

224
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:29,098
create adaptive, accessible experiences

225
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:32,482
that gracefully span the expanding ecosystem of

226
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,962
Internet connected devices. By staying up to date with

227
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:39,770
the latest web technologies and continuously refining our design and

228
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:43,578
development process, we can create websites that not only

229
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:47,834
meet current user expectations, but also anticipate future trends.

230
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:51,924
For example, the rise of progressive web apps offers

231
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:55,516
new opportunities for delivering app like experiences directly through the

232
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,780
web. Combining the best of both web and native web

233
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:02,540
worlds, progressive web apps provide features such

234
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:06,364
as offline access, push notifications, and fast load times,

235
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:10,412
enhancing user engagement and retention. By adopting PWA

236
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:13,804
standards, we can create more resilient and versatile web

237
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:17,396
applications that work seamlessly across all devices and network

238
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,414
conditions. Consider a realtor that retailer that

239
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:25,390
adopted PWA. By offering offline functionality and

240
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:29,558
push notifications, they were able to keep users engaged even

241
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:33,486
without an Internet connection. This led to a 50%

242
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,554
increase in user retention and higher overall customer satisfaction.

243
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:44,410
In conclusion, delivering robust, highly adoptable user

244
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:47,474
experiences requires a multidisciplinary approach,

245
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:51,210
leveraging modern web standards, performance optimization,

246
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:54,682
user centered and accessible design, and flexible

247
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:58,450
future proof architectures. Thank you for joining me today
