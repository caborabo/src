00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,262
Hi everyone. Today we are going to speak about cold start problem in social

2
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:31,650
marketplaces about balancing supply and demand.

3
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,138
And let's start with definitions. What is social marketplace?

4
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:38,694
What's the difference with the normal one? Well, if we

5
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:41,894
open any book and we try to google it, we'll find out something like

6
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:45,830
that. It's a blend of ecommerce and social media that allows fetching content

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,742
and using it for ecommerce needs. And actually, from this

8
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,878
major words, we need only the first couple.

9
00:00:52,964 --> 00:00:56,666
So it's a blend of ecommerce and social media. So it's

10
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,142
the marketplace when you can post some kind of a content

11
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:03,726
and then you can buy some goods, virtual or real one.

12
00:01:03,828 --> 00:01:07,218
So when you're building it as a startup or as a mature product,

13
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:10,082
you always have to think about two major things.

14
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:14,162
One is how to build a marketplace and the second, how to build a media.

15
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:17,622
And they got some effects between each other.

16
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:21,414
So what is the cold start problem and why we're so

17
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:24,738
focused on it, why it's so important in building marketplaces?

18
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:28,722
Actually, if we open any book about the building marketplaces,

19
00:01:28,786 --> 00:01:32,214
we'll find out that there is three major maturity levels

20
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:36,314
of marketplaces. It's a cold start when you got nothing, you got no

21
00:01:36,352 --> 00:01:40,506
supply, you got no demand, and you have to solve this chicken and egg problem.

22
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,126
What to start with, supply or demand? Then you move

23
00:01:44,148 --> 00:01:47,662
to the growth stage. When you try to balance your value

24
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:51,502
proposition and incentives, budget out compete other players, and if

25
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:54,850
everything goes so well that you're a major player,

26
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,242
you start in the dominance stage when you got the market

27
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:03,826
share, more than 50%, and your target is

28
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:07,122
to gradually capture remaining demand until you reach the full

29
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:10,706
situation. Why the call start is so important because it's

30
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:14,050
a starting phase. So you cannot build marketplace

31
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,606
avoiding this stage. And actually most of the startups, most of

32
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:20,902
the new products and new features, they are dying in this stage.

33
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:25,046
If you pass through it, it's really easier to work with growth

34
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,570
and the dominance. So it's the core of building the marketplaces,

35
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,762
as I said, two major things, media and ecommerce.

36
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:36,634
And they are not invented by Internet producers,

37
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:40,254
by product managers, et cetera. These two activities, these two

38
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:43,938
types of organizations, they coexist for a long time.

39
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:47,378
So let's talk about the history and

40
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:51,454
how they coexistent in a short way to understand how they interact

41
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:55,106
right now, first of all, let's assume that we are in

42
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:58,466
pre Internet times somewhere in the beginning of the or in

43
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:02,034
the middle of the 20th century, and we got some kind of a seller

44
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:05,686
that going to sell some kind of goods. Let's say we

45
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,242
are trying to sell the microphone. So we need to do

46
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:13,014
two simultaneous things. The first, it's the marketing

47
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:16,554
and you have to go to offline media to explain

48
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:20,394
to audience that your microphone is good, how it

49
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:23,562
works, why you need to buy it, why it's better than competitors.

50
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:27,390
Or if you just invented the microphone, what is the product is

51
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,846
why you are going to use it. And second thing, you have to

52
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:34,910
think about the distribution. Okay? Somehow you persuaded your audience

53
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,574
that they need the microphone. They still have to go to offline

54
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:42,370
store, they still have to exchange money to the microphone or

55
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,798
order the delivery and all the things.

56
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:50,194
So the offline store, it's the major distribution players

57
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:53,942
and then they got audience. So people have to look through

58
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:57,400
ads, so some PR articles, some different kind of

59
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,194
content there, and then they have to go

60
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:04,662
to store and then they have to perform the transactions.

61
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:08,982
And actually media and offline source, they wasn't

62
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:12,954
so aware about the audience, about how they behave,

63
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,206
et cetera. Then Internet came and we

64
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,334
all starting living in the new world where the

65
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:24,154
traditional media is changed to the social ones and the offline

66
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:27,854
stores is changed to the online stores. For the seller,

67
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:32,318
it's quite the same system. You still have to think about the marketing,

68
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:35,602
you still have to think about the distribution. It's still

69
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:38,950
the different places. So you have to work with both of them.

70
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,470
But the main difference there, that social media and online

71
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,750
stores started collecting preferences. So they started

72
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,120
to know their audience much better.

73
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,862
Social media knows what you are like and what you dislike,

74
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:55,466
what kind of content you interact with better and what you

75
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:58,874
are not. And online stores, they know your

76
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:02,174
preferences, they know what you bought, what you looked at,

77
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:05,646
maybe you added to the chart and then you're not

78
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:09,534
bought it somehow. So everything started moving around

79
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:13,586
the data about the predictions, about the recommendations. So what

80
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:17,154
is the social marketplace? It's the thing that

81
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:21,106
try to blend both content and media part with the

82
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:24,686
distribution part, because all the preferences can be combined

83
00:05:24,798 --> 00:05:29,238
and they can know the users extremely well. They know about the media

84
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:32,306
preferences, they know about the distribution preferences.

85
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:35,974
And actually for the seller it's better because you interact with one

86
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:39,402
organization. So you give them the idea of your product,

87
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:42,982
you create the content and it's everything like one involved

88
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:47,546
all in one shop. So this is the

89
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:51,686
commercial idea that we can not only make money on distribution,

90
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:55,246
not only make money on the content, but make all the

91
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:58,922
money here. So all the marketing spent and all the distribution

92
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:02,718
spent of the seller can go to one organization. So it's really a

93
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:06,434
good thing to grow. And actually everyone is

94
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:09,954
trying to blend and trying to move from the one

95
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:13,950
thing to another. Because if we see the market landscape,

96
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,478
we see that the traditional media that own the marketing budgets,

97
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:21,814
they trying to move to the distribution part. So they're trying

98
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:24,886
to move here from the left part to the right part of the

99
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:28,802
scheme because they, for example, started working based on the performance.

100
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:32,506
So you're not paying them for the views or for the number of

101
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:36,202
users. You start in paying for the number of orders created by

102
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:39,622
some ad or some placement, et cetera. Actually it's

103
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:43,118
small, but it's still a move to distribution part. So to understand

104
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:47,642
the transaction, to understand what content gives you better conversion to transactions,

105
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:51,114
not only to the views. And the second example, it's ecommerce.

106
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:54,146
Like the traditional ones, they only sold goods right now.

107
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:57,086
They start thinking about the content, rating and reviews,

108
00:06:57,198 --> 00:07:01,006
likes, some content produced by the users,

109
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,530
et cetera, everything that can move them up on this scheme

110
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,202
to got more like media or media ish

111
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,678
than the traditional ones, to combine all

112
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:15,000
business models in one.

113
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,526
As I said, when you are building the social marketplace, you have

114
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:22,966
to think about the both words. So you have to be focused

115
00:07:22,998 --> 00:07:26,634
on building a good media and you have to be focused on building

116
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:30,026
a good ecommerce. So both things are

117
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:33,214
extremely important to survive your cold start phase and

118
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,974
to go through it to the growth phase. So let's start

119
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:40,862
with media focus areas. First of all, when you think

120
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,254
about the content, it's all about the orchards. So who

121
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:48,270
is going to produce your content? What's their ideas,

122
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,714
how they are going to interact with your platform? Why? Why do they

123
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:54,834
need to work with you? Why do they need to work with you? Not what

124
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:58,626
to the others. Maybe they want to earn money. Maybe they want just

125
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,410
the bigger audience. They want to be famous, et cetera.

126
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,014
Maybe they already create some kind of a content, but they don't know where to

127
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:08,790
store it. And you can offer them good storage and then maybe

128
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,586
reuse it later. So the first of all, you have to understand

129
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:16,490
perfectly who is your authors, what their needs, how it works,

130
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,522
et cetera. So it's the first part of your strategy to describe this one.

131
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:24,046
Then as any media, it's the content. What kind

132
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:27,882
of content you are going to work with. Would it be texts or pictures

133
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:31,738
or videos or everything combined, something like the stories,

134
00:08:31,914 --> 00:08:35,346
how they're going to produce it? Do they need the special

135
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,540
devices for it? Or they can use their phones, or they can

136
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,978
voiceovers, et cetera. So what kind of content is.

137
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,642
It's not only about the business strategies, because when you start thinking

138
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:50,274
about the content types, you, for example, start shaping your technical

139
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:53,686
strategy, how you're going to store it, do you need the bigger storage or the

140
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,238
smaller ones? How much you're going to cost, how much you're going

141
00:08:57,244 --> 00:09:01,106
to spend to acquire and to store the content by one author.

142
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:05,610
If you're going to build a video hostage video

143
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,354
things, it's much more storage. So it

144
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:13,054
will cost you much more than, for example, if you're working with texts or

145
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:16,266
pictures or you are going to create something on the fly.

146
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:20,202
Right now we are waiting for the AR and VR revolution

147
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:23,570
and new devices. It's much more to store there

148
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,346
than the video things. The third thing after the

149
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:30,978
content is distribution, how we are going to move

150
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:34,690
the content from the author to the audience.

151
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,670
Shell audience, just subscribe orders or you're going to create a recommendation system

152
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,686
or you don't need the subscription. You just ask the interested of

153
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,302
the audience and then you push the content there like the TikTok does,

154
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:51,238
et cetera. So this is the major things about the distribution,

155
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:54,826
because again, it's shaping your business strategy, it's shaping your

156
00:09:54,848 --> 00:09:58,358
product strategy, and you're shaping your technical strategy. If you're

157
00:09:58,374 --> 00:10:01,702
going to create the best in class recommendation systems,

158
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:05,486
first of all, you have to get some data somewhere and then

159
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:09,242
you have to create this machine learning algorithm

160
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:12,826
to create these recommendations. If you're in a cold star phase,

161
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:16,478
how you are going to do it, you still don't have any alters

162
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,146
and you still don't have any audience. This is the

163
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:24,274
major things to think about. And the last one, but not the least the

164
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:27,714
audience. Why should they use your social marketplace,

165
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:31,480
how you're going to incentivize them, how you're going to attract them,

166
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,254
what kind of user journey, what kind of

167
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:40,106
value they got from your content and how

168
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:43,466
you're going to present yourself for the

169
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:47,290
audience. Segmentations, these four major focus

170
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,586
areas. When we think about the media part of the

171
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,178
social marketplaces, you have to have answers

172
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:57,290
and descriptions for all the major four parts.

173
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,086
And actually you have to prove all the things. So it's a hypothesis. So you

174
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:05,330
have to test it. You have to understand your audience better until

175
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,140
you got the perfect strategies to work with later.

176
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,074
The second major part, it's marketplaces. And for

177
00:11:13,112 --> 00:11:16,386
marketplace in the cold start phase,

178
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:20,946
there is three major focus areas. It's incentives, its flywheels

179
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:24,866
and its density. Let's start with the major one, with incentives.

180
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:28,982
Actually you have to think about the potential user CGM

181
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:32,970
in the real world, because right now they already do something,

182
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,458
they already produce some content or not, they already

183
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:39,740
live their life, they already buy some products.

184
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,806
And you have to understand in what part of their lives your

185
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,502
product will be fit in, what moment of

186
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:50,686
life there is the peak value for them,

187
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:53,898
how you are going to interact with them in terms of the marketing, how you're

188
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:57,394
going to catch them, what would be the wow moment, how it

189
00:11:57,512 --> 00:12:00,946
affects with it. And when we speak about the CGM, it's not

190
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:04,558
only about drawing the process and understanding the audience,

191
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,894
it's about the creation, the value proposition that is

192
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:11,634
relative to competition. So it's not just the value proposition

193
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:15,026
will give you the money or will give you the audience likes,

194
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:18,854
et cetera. We always have to think what is the

195
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,822
competitor's proposition? And when they say about the social marketplaces,

196
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:26,746
it can be anything. It can be reading a book, it can be playing with

197
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:30,714
children, it can be going to a walk. Everything that consumes time,

198
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:34,426
that is time that not spent on your product. So when you

199
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:37,918
create this potential user of CGM, you have to ask yourself,

200
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:42,510
what would be my value proposition for them relative to the competition

201
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,770
and the last part of the incentives? It's the right

202
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,514
segment. And in my understanding, the key here is

203
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:54,402
to start with the segment that are somehow underserved by the

204
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:58,022
current players and by the competitors. So maybe

205
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:02,038
you can create the video marketplace for those that

206
00:13:02,204 --> 00:13:05,254
cannot using the YouTube and TikTok. I don't know

207
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:08,886
why. Maybe they don't have the media literacy, so they

208
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:12,330
don't know how to create a video or they don't have the proper

209
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,738
device and you can create the machine. Learning that, creating a

210
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:19,260
video from the voice. So I just call the phone,

211
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,402
say some words and then video appears. This is the segment

212
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:27,518
that is underserved by the current players. It's really the cool thing

213
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:31,802
about the incentives, because when you're trying to compete with the current audience,

214
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:35,314
it's extremely difficult to persuade them to

215
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:39,490
switch. Let's say you're calling the major YouTube blogger with the

216
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,314
major money coming from the YouTube big audience and say, well, we are

217
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:47,154
startup, we don't have any audience right now, but we really like you and we

218
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:50,246
want you to move from YouTube or at least to copy your content to

219
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:54,358
our small and unknown company and unknown product.

220
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:58,194
Actually, I think that would be some kind of problems with this conversation.

221
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:02,266
If you find out someone who is not on any big platform

222
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:05,914
right now and who is creating his content with you and

223
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:09,126
growing with you, actually it's not only about the attracting

224
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:12,830
them, it's about the retention. Because when they started

225
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,314
growing with your platform and they created the fortune

226
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:20,074
together with you, you really stick with them. They are emotionally

227
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:23,040
stick and they are like economically stick with your product.

228
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,818
After we understood the incentives for all groups of people,

229
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:30,914
it's really important to think about the flywheels. When we speak

230
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:35,090
about the content of any type, usually supply more important

231
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,790
than demand because supply sticks longer on your

232
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,790
platform. You can reuse it in different things,

233
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,102
in different ways. You can test different ways

234
00:14:46,156 --> 00:14:50,406
of interacting with the content. So for example, different distribution

235
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,518
mentioned on the previous slides for the same piece of content. You can reuse

236
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:58,234
it, recut it somehow. If you

237
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:02,022
somewhere create a demand but you have zero supply,

238
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:05,262
you just burn your money and your efforts. So the

239
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:08,734
major things it's to start with supply. If you are going

240
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:12,314
to start with demand, you have to find the right explanation

241
00:15:12,362 --> 00:15:15,778
to yourself and to your team why you are

242
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:18,900
going it and trying to test it before.

243
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,286
After you understand how you're going to get the supply.

244
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:26,034
Actually to create a proper flywheel, you have to create the

245
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:29,606
multiple gross loops stacked upon each other. So what

246
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,834
do I mean here? Let's say we understood

247
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:36,086
that we find out the core audience and the core type of content and

248
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:39,738
they uploaded the first piece of it, the first video, let's say

249
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:43,274
maybe we can motivate them to share it outside the platform

250
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:46,794
and to invite some audience, maybe friends, maybe family,

251
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,406
maybe business partners, et cetera. The process should be

252
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:54,206
extremely easy for them and the motivation from the

253
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:58,320
incentives part should be clear and clear for them.

254
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,014
Let's say we created this first growth loop and we

255
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:05,710
attracted some kind of audience that trying to interact with the content.

256
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,602
We have to think about the second growth loops stacked on top of the first

257
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:13,630
one. Maybe it's a sharing, maybe it's some kind of a competition or a challenge.

258
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,220
So when you see the video, you have to recreate it by your own.

259
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,346
We have to give some tools to do it easily, et cetera.

260
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:23,986
So the more growth loops we stacked upon each other, the better fly

261
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:27,478
will swing up. Why? It's important because we have to

262
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:31,226
build the network effects. All marketplaces are based on

263
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:34,986
the idea that the more audience gives you more value of

264
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:39,094
the product. If you take YouTube, everyone is creating

265
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:42,830
the video. You can create video on anything there. So even those

266
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,366
who use YouTube for free, they not pay anything and

267
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:49,838
they produce not much views. They still

268
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:53,486
produce the value for YouTube because it fits

269
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:57,426
for the recommendations, it's improving for the search engines. So you

270
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:01,054
have to think about what would be the network effects

271
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:04,914
after I invented and started interacting with

272
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:08,840
the first types of audience, with the first customers.

273
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,418
And when we think about the network effects,

274
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:15,910
here comes the third major things. It's density.

275
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,670
Because when you took any kind of marketplace,

276
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,382
almost any, it's not the same unified

277
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:27,130
thing as we can see here in the picture. There is some different

278
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,694
regions in this city, and some of them are quite dense

279
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:34,214
and some of them are not. So each marketplace, it's a combination

280
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,174
of isolated submarkets. If we speak about

281
00:17:38,212 --> 00:17:41,678
the content, the first one is a language. If you are creating content

282
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:45,186
that needed to be understanded, like it's a text or

283
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,594
a video with voiceover, et cetera, or some memes with

284
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:51,746
text, it has to be understanded. So you got the

285
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:55,650
submarket based on the language. The second type, for example,

286
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,314
is the thematic. So if you are going to create some content about

287
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:02,626
the cars, it is. If I'm not interested in cars,

288
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:06,102
it would not be my content. If you are going to create some content about,

289
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:09,418
I don't know, the math or the chemistry or anything

290
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:12,966
else. This one, the submarket.

291
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:16,954
And you have to understand its size. And you have to understand, are you

292
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:19,830
dense in this particular market? So, for example,

293
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,920
english videos about the chemistry, it's quite

294
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,070
well articulated submarket. And if you got new

295
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,286
suppliers and new content creators, which is

296
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:35,886
creating the videos about the chemistry,

297
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:39,602
but in Japanese, they are not creating density for the

298
00:18:39,656 --> 00:18:43,486
submarket, they're creating for the different ones. So you cannot measure it on average.

299
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:48,120
You have to measure the density on each submarkets and

300
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,354
to achieve it on the first phase, when we are on the cold

301
00:18:52,402 --> 00:18:56,598
start, we don't have much audience there. It's really

302
00:18:56,764 --> 00:19:00,502
useful and really easy to focus on some selected

303
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:04,074
submarkets and experiences there. So try new

304
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:07,802
things there and see is it work or not? And after you find

305
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,946
some good mechanics about the content, about the orders,

306
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:14,734
about the distribution or the audience, you then after

307
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:18,954
you test it on some small things, you can move it and scale

308
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:22,560
it to grow markets around it.

309
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,466
This thing, you have to understand it so you can create the

310
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:29,918
same product in terms of features and values,

311
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:33,406
how they upload content, how they like it, how they comment it, et cetera.

312
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,054
And it can be universal. But when we speak about the marketing,

313
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:40,194
when we speak about the partnership, how we are going to attract the audience,

314
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:43,510
how we are going to incentivize them, this is right place

315
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,694
to think about the submarkets and to focus your marketing and your partnerships

316
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:51,446
efforts. Well, if you want me to conclude?

317
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:55,562
How to survive the cold start phase. When you're building

318
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:58,778
the social marketplaces, there is three major things.

319
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,334
First, find right incentives. Until you got right

320
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:06,206
incentives for your audience, it's useless. Then after you

321
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:10,794
find right incentive, this kind of incentive have to start the flywheels

322
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:14,818
start and produce spinning. So you have to think about the

323
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:18,834
features, you have to think about some characteristics of your product

324
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:23,182
that not only intensifies people to come there, but to attract

325
00:20:23,246 --> 00:20:26,914
new users and to create growth for you that is not driven

326
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:31,080
by the paid marketing, but driven by the users itself.

327
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,982
And at the end, you have to increase density by

328
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:38,886
these flywheels in focus submarkets. And one by one,

329
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,262
you can close the markets on the density level that

330
00:20:42,316 --> 00:20:45,494
you're okay with, that your possible investors, okay with your

331
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:49,000
team, et cetera. And then it started growing by itself.

332
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,380
So, thank you.
