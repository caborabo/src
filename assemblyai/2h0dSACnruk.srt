00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,530
Hi everyone. My name is Amit Anaja. Thank you so much for joining

2
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:30,962
in the conference. The topic here is accelerating

3
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,778
pharmaceutical innovation and how we can leverage artificial

4
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,026
intelligence in drug discovery. The idea is transforming

5
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,054
the drug discovery process with advanced machine learning algorithms.

6
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:45,906
So the first thing we need to talk about is what are the different challenges

7
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,034
that we see in the traditional drug discovery? The traditional

8
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:53,350
drug discovery process is way too lengthy. It often takes like

9
00:00:53,382 --> 00:00:56,434
over a decade from initial discovery to market launch.

10
00:00:56,774 --> 00:01:00,118
And along with that, the costs associated with bringing a new drug

11
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:04,430
to the market are staggering, frequently exceeding over $2.6

12
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:07,982
billion per drug. The pharmaceutical industry is in dire

13
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:11,534
need of innovative solutions to expedite the drug

14
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:14,194
discovery process and reduce the development costs.

15
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:18,134
Now, how AI can help this there are different AI

16
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:21,890
powered methodologies in drug discovery. Advanced machine learning

17
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:25,250
algorithms such as deep learning, reinforcement learning are

18
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:29,450
being employed to revolutionize the drug discovery. These AI powered

19
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:33,554
methodologies can actually analyze vast datasets to

20
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,546
accurately predict different molecular interactions and identify

21
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,370
promising drug candidates rapidly. By leveraging

22
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:45,466
the power of AI, these different pharmaceutical companies can

23
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,226
significantly streamline the drug discovery process and exploit

24
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,234
innovation. Let's talk about comprehensive chemical and bioactivity

25
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:56,874
databases. There are different databases like which are

26
00:01:56,914 --> 00:02:00,098
extensive chemical and bioactive databases like

27
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:03,770
Campbell and Pupkin, which serves as essential

28
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:07,330
resources for training AI models in drug discovery.

29
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:11,690
These databases enable virtual screening and molecular docking

30
00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:15,162
techniques that greatly enhance the efficiency of

31
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:19,074
identifying and optimizing drug candidates. By leveraging

32
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:21,882
the wealth of data available in these databases,

33
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,554
AI models can make more accurate predictions and

34
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:27,854
uncover novel drug candidates.

35
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:31,730
Let's take a case study here identifying novel

36
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:35,762
cancer enzyme inhibitors a deep learning model was

37
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,370
actually applied to the Kembl database to identify

38
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:43,404
novels inhibitors for key enzymes involved

39
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:47,204
in cancer progression. The AI model successfully

40
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:50,876
pinpointed several promising inhibitors that

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,524
were previously unknown. Experimental assays confirmed

42
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:59,340
that these AI identified inhibitors exhibited high

43
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:03,236
efficiency and favorable safety profiles.

44
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,150
These novel inhibitors show great potential for further

45
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:10,830
clinical trials and could lead to the development of new cancer

46
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:14,734
therapies. Now, what's the impact we see of AI

47
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:18,334
on drug discovery? The AI powered methodologies

48
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:21,886
do have the potential to significantly reduce the time to

49
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,622
market for new drugs, bringing innovative treatments to patients

50
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:28,718
faster. By streamlining the drug discovery process,

51
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:32,502
AI can actually slash research and development costs by up

52
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:35,868
to 70%, making discovery development more cost

53
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:39,412
effective. The integration of AI in drug discovery

54
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:42,876
accelerates the delivery of new treatments to patients,

55
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,892
improving healthcare outcomes. AI enhances the pharmaceutical

56
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:50,964
industry's ability to respond swiftly

57
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:55,004
to emerging health crisis, such as pandemic or

58
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:59,132
new disease outbreaks. Now let's talk about the pharmaceutical

59
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:03,014
research future with AI. As AI and machine

60
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:06,598

00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:29,654
Meeting patient needs more efficiently. AI also paves

67
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:33,222
the way for personalized medicine, enabling the development

68
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:37,150
of targeted therapies tailored to individual patient

69
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:41,634
characteristics. Let's talk about challenges and considerations.

70
00:04:42,294 --> 00:04:46,262
Ensuring the quality and standardization of data used

71
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:50,182
to train AI models is very crucial for accurate predictions

72
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:54,238
and reliable results. Addressing ethical concerns

73
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:57,398
and potential biases in AI algorithms

74
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:00,902
is essential to ensure fair and unbiased
