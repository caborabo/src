00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,422
Hello everyone, welcome to today's session on unleash the power of

2
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:28,010
Genei. Generate growth and innovation with data.

3
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:31,882
My name is Akanksha Sharon. I am principal data lead

4
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:35,614
at AWS for UK public sector.

5
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:40,010
Now generative AI has taken the world by storm.

6
00:00:40,202 --> 00:00:43,322
I'm sure all of you have heard about applications

7
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:47,122
like Chat GPT and it just shows how powerful

8
00:00:47,178 --> 00:00:50,054
the latest machine learning modules have become.

9
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:54,194
The true power of generative AI goes beyond a search

10
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:57,390
engine or a chatbot or, you know,

11
00:00:57,522 --> 00:01:00,878
chat GPT. It will essentially, you know,

12
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:04,654
transform how companies or organization operate or

13
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:08,774
will operate in future. Just to share some

14
00:01:08,854 --> 00:01:12,434
perspective here, Gold Goldman Sachs

15
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:16,790
forecasted a 7 trillion increase in global

16
00:01:16,862 --> 00:01:21,198
GDP. They also predict that JNAi

17
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:24,418
has lifted the productivity growth by

18
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:28,426
one and a half percentage over ten periods of time. This is

19
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,614
just a small glimpse of potential of Genai.

20
00:01:32,394 --> 00:01:36,362
Now, I've worked with lot of customers, enterprise customers,

21
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,874
public sector customers, and I think it is safe to say

22
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:44,274
that everyone acknowledges the power of Genai and

23
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:47,738
they are comfortable in thinking big with Genai

24
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:51,706
or they are actually making plans how Genai can be utilized

25
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,644
in their organization. But what I find is nearly

26
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:59,620
everyone I speak with focuses on foundation

27
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:03,684
models and LLM more broadly. So the

28
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:07,580
iceberg that you see, the tip of the iceberg is the

29
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:11,596
Genai application, right? There is more

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,956
under the glacier, there is more that

31
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,104
meets the eye at the first glance, right? And this is like my favorite slide.

32
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:23,568
So what enables you to drive the value of

33
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,936
Genai? Now, Genai applications

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,456
are still applications, and like any other application,

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,416
you need a database underneath it. So you eventually

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,464
need an operational database to support your user experience

37
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:41,832
and your Genai applications. So if

38
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:45,416
you see on the slides on the right, you need a storage

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,896
layer, you need a database layer that will have purpose built

40
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,444
databases like document, DB, graphDB,

41
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:56,216
vector enabled databases, right? And then there

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,816
is data integrations. You need the source of

43
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,504
your data, you know, whether the data is going to come in batches

44
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,896
or via streamlining or, you know, you set up

45
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,524
your pipelines to keep up with data change.

46
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:13,688
Finally, you also have to consider governance,

47
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:17,104
you know, process to ensure data quality, privacy,

48
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:21,390
security, right? So while it is very tempting to

49
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:24,846
think about generative AI at a surface level or as a

50
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,614
tip of the iceberg, really the data you

51
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:32,954
need to nail down effectively

52
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:36,422
and use modern data architecture,

53
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:39,718
right? And data is, I could say

54
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:44,194
a foundation module of building your Jennai application.

55
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:48,312
And in future slides, you know, in upcoming slides we're going to

56
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,488
talk more about, you know, how data is more important. Right?

57
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:55,448
Next slide. Yeah. Another data point

58
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:58,936
that we have is from a McKinsey report. And,

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,924
you know, there's a link to that report that you can see.

60
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:06,672
Companies that have not yet found ways

61
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:10,292
to effectively harmonize and provide

62
00:04:10,428 --> 00:04:13,620
access to their data, unable to

63
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,996
fine tune their generative AI and which

64
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,116
will eventually, you know, they won't be able to use

65
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,148
Genai for their customers or will not be able to unlock full

66
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:29,116
potential of Genai to do this. This requires

67
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,468
a very clear data and infrastructure

68
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:36,116
strategy. Now, why does data matter so

69
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,994
much? I've been talking about data in like few slides now, right?

70
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:42,854
So let's see why data matters a lot.

71
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:46,650
Now, when you want to build your Genai

72
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:50,314
application, there are unique

73
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:53,778
to your business needs and for, and unique for your customer base,

74
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,266
right? Your data is your differentiator. You know,

75
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,570
as the name suggested, the data is your key differentiator.

76
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:04,218
And let me give you more thoughts on this right now. When you think

77
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:08,096
about it, every company has access to some foundation

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,808
models, right? Some of them are easily available in the marketplace.

79
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:14,888
Some of them are easily available in GitHub that you can download

80
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:18,240
and use it, right? But the companies will

81
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:22,136
be successful if they build a Jenny eye application with

82
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,760
real business data or business value data

83
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:29,344
that will help them to build a

84
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:33,136
amazing Genai application which caters their

85
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,536
customer history, their needs, their utilization pattern

86
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,454
and whatnot. Right? So data is the difference between

87
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:44,534
the generic genai application and

88
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:48,254
those that know your business and your customer deeply.

89
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:53,226
And I've seen it with many customers where, you know, they have taken on the

90
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,498
shelf foundation modules and not really taken care

91
00:05:56,546 --> 00:06:00,370
about data. And eventually they don't see much benefit of those applications

92
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:03,890
now, right? Whereas I've seen organizations who

93
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:07,402
work backwards from their data build the

94
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:11,098
Jennai application, or even if they take off the shelf genei

95
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:15,426
application, they actually embed it with their own business data.

96
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,634
And that really helps them to make it, you know,

97
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:22,294
serve their customer in a better way. Right? Now,

98
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:26,746
using data for Jnai actually doesn't mean that you have to

99
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,090
go and build your own model, right? So it doesn't

100
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:33,866
mean that, as I said right. Now, while some companies will build,

101
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,126
and there are a couple of type of, you know, company, so there could be

102
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,678
one organization that will build and train their own

103
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:43,994
large language modules with vast amount of data,

104
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:48,270
and many will use their organizational data to fine

105
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:51,974
tune their foundation models for their unique business

106
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:54,750
use case or their unique needs,

107
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:58,286
right? But underlying all of this, the key

108
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,034
message is the data is your differentiator.

109
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:05,944
Now, you know, in a recent surveys with CDO's,

110
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:09,400
we found that 93% of CDO's

111
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:12,712
said that the importance of the data strategy

112
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:16,864
and its role in making generative AI custom to

113
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:20,456
their business is one of the most important thing that they

114
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,448
can do, right. And on the right hand side,

115
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:27,496
37% of CDO's agreed that lack of

116
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,052
the right data foundation or a data strategy was one

117
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:34,904
of the top challenges to implement generative AI.

118
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:39,420
So now data foundation matters for generative AI because

119
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:43,504
the access to high quality data about your organization

120
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:47,340
and your customer improves the accuracy

121
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:51,084
and reliability of these GenAI modules and their

122
00:07:51,124 --> 00:07:55,044
responses as well. Now this is another example.

123
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:59,428
Now, if you I would like to share an example of an online travel agency

124
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:03,742
here, and they want to generate personalized travel

125
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:07,606
itinerary. So when you want to do this personalized itinerary,

126
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,006
what you would like to use as an organization is your customer profile data

127
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,062
in your databases. And based on this data,

128
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:18,350
you would like to tailor the recommendation based on

129
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:22,354
things like past trips history,

130
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:26,430
travel preferences, hotel preferences, preferences of

131
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:30,166
family members, age of the family members and things like that,

132
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,456
right? So what you will do is you will marry that

133
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,128
data with the other company details like flight

134
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:40,880
details, hotel inventory, promotions and things like that.

135
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:43,960
So if you look at this, you know, there are a couple of data points

136
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:47,944
that you're using. There are two kind of different data sets that you're using.

137
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:52,064
So again, it is very important, where is this data set residing

138
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:55,472
and how easily can you access it? The more easily

139
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:59,404
you can access it and secure it, the more easy your

140
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:03,874
response is going to generate. The personalized travel

141
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:07,330
itinerary. Now there's another example here we

142
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:10,682
have. Now, you know, I've been talking about this powerful

143
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:13,442
capabilities of Genei to create content,

144
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:16,914
right? But to make this content, you know,

145
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:20,034
relevant to your organization, you would definitely like to

146
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:23,418
customize it and customize it with things like your

147
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:27,094
own brand logo, your own brand guidebook.

148
00:09:27,514 --> 00:09:31,162
What were your previous ad, you know, content from your data

149
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:34,762
lake as well as, you know, company data, like real

150
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:38,458
time inventory of your transactional database and so forth,

151
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:42,154
right? So you eventually are going to use the jenny,

152
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:45,754
but you're under using the data from all your different

153
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:49,174
traditional or transactional databases as well.

154
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:53,554
Now, to get the high quality data for JNAi,

155
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,334
you need a strong data foundation,

156
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:01,004
right? In fact, like, I'm sure many of you who are listening

157
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:04,356
to me would have already spoken or would have

158
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,172
had a data strategy. You know, in your

159
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,956
organization, that's a different thing. Whether you're working towards it

160
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,796
or you're running into some issues with it, but we can definitely help you

161
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,460
with that process. Right. But Jenny, I make this

162
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:23,228
data foundation even more critical than ever because your

163
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:27,148
data is your differentiator. Right? I've met so many organization

164
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:30,556
that were not really to adopt cloud,

165
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,364
they were not thinking about data strategy. But now with JNai,

166
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:38,004
it is becoming more and more critical for them to

167
00:10:38,164 --> 00:10:41,740
put this as a priority, right? So your data has

168
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:44,504
to be up to date, complete,

169
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:48,092
accurate, discoverable and available.

170
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:52,356
Right? So that is like your key things for your data

171
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,084
strategy. Now, these are a couple of modules

172
00:10:56,124 --> 00:11:00,242
for JNAi that we have. Obviously we have purpose build LLM,

173
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:04,642
then we have fine tuning of LLM, and then we have Rag,

174
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:08,594
right? And for the purpose of this presentation, I'll pick up

175
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:12,054
the rag use case and work towards it.

176
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:16,882
Now, with Rag, the external data used to augment

177
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:20,626
your prompts can come from multiple data sources.

178
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,922
It could include documents, different repositories,

179
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:27,620
databases, APIs. Right. And Reg

180
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:31,980
helps the module to adjust its output with data retrieved

181
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:35,556
as and when needed, so that you know, it can prompt you

182
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,884
with right information. So this is just a quick overview of

183
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:42,884
what Rag is. And this is a very high

184
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:45,708
level reference architecture of, for rag.

185
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:49,076
Right. Now you'll notice two sides to

186
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,502
the story. On the left hand side you have processes that

187
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:56,750
occurs in the end user critical path. That is,

188
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:00,286
the end user interacts with application and is

189
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,022
waiting for a response. And on the right hand side are

190
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:06,942
the processes that happens behind the scene,

191
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,994
right, like ingestion from data sources,

192
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:15,726
batch and stream processing, data integration

193
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,414
with pipelines. So you need this for

194
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:23,702
populating your vector databases and various enterprise

195
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,994
databases or data warehouses.

196
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:30,950
Now notice the data governance and data warehouse

197
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:33,870
and vector data store. These are very critical, right.

198
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:37,470
And what I am seeing and what most and more customers are doing

199
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:41,354
is they are modernizing their entire infrastructure

200
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:45,382
by moving them to the cloud. And this includes

201
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:49,182
relational databases, non relational databases,

202
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,344
right. And let's talk more about the vector

203
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:56,004
data store that is there in the screen. Right.

204
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:02,280
Before we go there, let's look at this critical

205
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:06,080
path for the end user here. Right now.

206
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:09,576
This is again a set of use case, set of scenario

207
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,768
that we have. I don't have animation right now,

208
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:16,534
but I'll go by the numbers on the screen here. So,

209
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:21,746
yeah, the first one is, you know, the end user interacts

210
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,346
with JNAi application and typically by posing

211
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,218
a question. And this is just to give you a example of what

212
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,410
happens underneath, right? So an end

213
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:36,170
user interacts with the Jenny application is number one. The second is

214
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:40,906
the application loads the relevant prompt template and,

215
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,522
you know, you can create your own templates based on different rules

216
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:48,092
that you have and things like that. Then there is

217
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:51,348
a number three. Is that the question posed by the user?

218
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:55,516
Right. It could be a new question or it could be an ongoing conversation.

219
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,388
Right. So anyways, in that case, you know, what we have to do is

220
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:02,852
we have to look into the history data

221
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,428
store to allow the user to pick up where they left off.

222
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:09,876
Let's say this is in between the conversation. And, you know,

223
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,928
this is a very good example when you go online and you go for

224
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:17,552
like chat option or you go for online help

225
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:21,432
option, right. This is a critical workflow. And for that.

226
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:25,408
So anyways, application needs to pick up where the customer lost the application.

227
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:28,560
We need to pull that state into the right context. Right.

228
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:30,804
What was the context we were asking that question?

229
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:35,072
Number four is the application need to query for profile

230
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:38,896
or any other situational data, right. And this typically would

231
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,826
come out of like a data store. For example, if you're returning something,

232
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,994
right. It would go back to your historical data store and say,

233
00:14:46,114 --> 00:14:49,410
when did you purchase this? And details of the order and all of that,

234
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:53,254
right. Number five is it tokenizes the original question,

235
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:57,614
so, you know, to get a set of embeddings from the LLM.

236
00:14:58,034 --> 00:15:01,658
And number six, what happens is with those questions embedding,

237
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:06,054
it performs a similar search in the vector data store.

238
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:10,630
This is using some form of algorithm

239
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:14,214
which basically tells you the nearest neighbor search

240
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:17,510
for the algorithm, right. And it searches,

241
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:21,366
you know, that along with some context. Right. So it basically creates

242
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,646
its algorithm to search it. Number seven is once

243
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,310
all that data is synthesized into a prompt, it is

244
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:31,714
then sent to LLM to get a response,

245
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:34,934
right? And number eight is, you know,

246
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:39,306
it updates the conversation state and history according to the new

247
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,586
interaction. And number nine is finally is the

248
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,134
response that you see on the screen, like so, you know,

249
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:50,122
if you really dive deep, you know, I've used data stores and,

250
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:53,354
you know, retrieving the historical information and all of that.

251
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:56,210
Right. You know, if you dive deep, you know,

252
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:59,808
different layers and see what data services you should all

253
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:03,200
consider for these architectural prompts. Right? And one of

254
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:06,496
this is vector databases. So let me go to the next

255
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,056
slide and talk more about what is a vector data

256
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,512
store? Right, perfect. Now, vector embeddings,

257
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:18,128
basically it represents word and phrases

258
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:21,864
and entities as numerical vectors in a multi

259
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:25,892
dimensional space. Now, in this example that you see,

260
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,732
the words or items with similar meanings are

261
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,344
mapped closer to each other in this space.

262
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:37,332
This kind of representation or this kind of semantic

263
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:41,028
relationship actually enables genai to

264
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:44,292
understand similarities and relationship between words

265
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:47,676
and entities, right? So for example, like, if you

266
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,664
say sandals, high heels,

267
00:16:50,414 --> 00:16:53,742
color, comfort, fit,

268
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:57,390
you know, all of these are similar things and this will help them to kind

269
00:16:57,422 --> 00:17:00,434
of do that. Next slide.

270
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:04,654
Okay, now, vector embeddings are essentially

271
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:09,534
numerical representation of your audio

272
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:12,354
or video data, right?

273
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:16,142
While humans can understand the meaning of all these words,

274
00:17:16,198 --> 00:17:19,357
right? But machine cannot and machine will

275
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:23,413
only understand numbers. So do

276
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:27,285
that. To make them understand that, we have to translate them into format that

277
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:30,713
is suitable for machine learning or for the jenny I application.

278
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:34,553
And this is essentially what is called vector embeddings.

279
00:17:35,573 --> 00:17:39,273
This is a very good example of vector embedding.

280
00:17:39,653 --> 00:17:44,313
Now let's assume by assigning numbers to different words,

281
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:48,564
you know, we can view vectors in a multi dimensional space, as I said.

282
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:52,104
Right? And then you can measure the distance between them.

283
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:56,900
For instance, you know, if you look at this graph, cat is

284
00:17:56,932 --> 00:18:01,104
closer to kitten, whereas dog is closer to puppy.

285
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:04,716
So now by comparing these embeddings in this way,

286
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,836
the module, the Jnai module, will produce more relevant

287
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,056
and contextual responses for the question

288
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,224
that was asked or for a matching word, right?

289
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:19,684
So this is how, you know, whole vector,

290
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:23,524
you know, assignment works. Basically.

291
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:27,844
Another example, just to give you more insight, you know,

292
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:32,768
this is called a superpower semantic search for

293
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:36,128
use cases, you know, like rich media search or

294
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:39,900
for product recommendations. So when you go on the websites and you get some

295
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:44,340
product recommendations based on your previous purchase history

296
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:47,812
or what have you typed in or, you know, what have you seen

297
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:50,820
in that specific portal and things like that.

298
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:54,668
Right? Now, in this scenario and in this screenshot that you see on the screen,

299
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:59,532
you can see that semantic search greatly enhances the

300
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:02,724
accuracy of the output of the query,

301
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:06,712
right? Like one of the things that you say is bright color

302
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:10,392
golf shoes, right? So that is like very, very specific,

303
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:13,752
and that is how attaching vectors and numbers

304
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:18,232
to the search query makes it very, very precise

305
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:20,204
in scenarios like this, right?

306
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:22,644
Okay,

307
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:27,632
so most of our custom,

308
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:31,440
I've spoken about vectors, and now let's talk about how does this vector and

309
00:19:31,472 --> 00:19:35,474
data work together. Right? Now, many of our customers

310
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,714
are using vectors for their genai application.

311
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:44,102
And one of the feedback that we have got from them is their existing

312
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:47,514
databases should have vector enabled

313
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:52,154
and it will make them more confident, it will

314
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:57,070
meet the requirements of being scalable, available and

315
00:19:57,102 --> 00:20:00,150
provide durability,

316
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:02,790
storage and high compute, right?

317
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:06,262
And what we have done is we have made sure that when

318
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:09,558
your vector and business data are stored in the same

319
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:12,790
place, your application will run faster,

320
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:16,390
because when they are in the same place, there is no need or no,

321
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:20,294
you don't have to worry about data sync or data movement and,

322
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:23,798
you know, data silos at all. So we store our vector

323
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:27,442
and database together. And that is why we have,

324
00:20:27,598 --> 00:20:31,854
um, enabled vector searches across our multiple

325
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:36,418
services that you see. We have Amazon open search,

326
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:40,522
we have Aurora postgres, we have RDS postgres,

327
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:44,074
Neptune document DB and DynamoDB also has

328
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:47,254
zero ETL for faster retrieval.

329
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:52,522
So this is our famous flywheel. And we start

330
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:56,236
off with, you know, unify where you make sure that you

331
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,924
break down your data silos, you innovate by building

332
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:03,740
new Ji application and you modernize your

333
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:07,916
data infrastructure. Now, the beauty about this flywheel

334
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,100
is you can essentially start off your data modernization or

335
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:15,732
data strategy from anywhere, right? Like,

336
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:19,524
I've met customers who would say, I'm going to start off with innovate

337
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:22,802
where I'm going to innovate genai application,

338
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:27,138
you know, work on my llms and work on my use cases

339
00:21:27,306 --> 00:21:30,642
and then go to the modernizing your data

340
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:34,498
or, you know, infrastructure and then think about not

341
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:38,058
having data silos or making more use of those data. And then,

342
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:41,978
you know, flywheel goes where I have come across customers

343
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:45,010
who would say, yes, we would like to go to cloud first,

344
00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:48,770
have a modern data structure infrastructure

345
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:51,850
on the cloud, have a great data strategy,

346
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:55,530
utilize all the benefits of the cloud and then go in the flywheel

347
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:59,194
and then innovate and all of that. So the beauty of this flywheel is,

348
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,922
you know, we can start off from anywhere and then once you

349
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:06,538
are in the flywheel, it will just power itself and goes from there.

350
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:10,682
Right. Also, you know, this whole flywheel

351
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:14,282
avoids the risk of getting logged into a proprietary

352
00:22:14,338 --> 00:22:18,018
format. It will help you break down data silos

353
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:21,362
and, you know, empower your team to build Genai

354
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:25,530
applications, building a data foundation to

355
00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:28,970
fuel your generative AI application. You know,

356
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:33,634
AWS provides a wide variety of services

357
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:37,378
which are comprehensive services for each use.

358
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:40,826
We have integrated with vector databases,

359
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,602
zero etL, so you can easily connect to your different data

360
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:48,186
stores, right. If you're already in cloud and using any

361
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,778
of your services, we have zero ETL in most of our services that will

362
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:55,978
easily help you to connect and access your

363
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:59,690
data all around. And then we have some

364
00:22:59,722 --> 00:23:03,314
very good data governance as well available to

365
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:06,458
have secure your data in the cloud and

366
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:10,050
also utilize some policies or user access as well.

367
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:13,734
So we have lot of services aligned to that as well.

368
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:17,894
Now, where we can help, there are a couple of places where we can help.

369
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:22,234
You can obviously go to our generative AI innovation

370
00:23:22,314 --> 00:23:25,794
center page and request for a conversation or if you're

371
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:29,730
already one of our customers and reach out to your respective

372
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:33,314
account team. But there are a few ways you can we can help you is

373
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:37,234
about getting buy in from your exec on data strategy.

374
00:23:37,354 --> 00:23:41,330
The next one is we can help your organization to

375
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:45,274
envision, you know, data to

376
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:48,602
drive some of the business outcome. Maybe do a POC, maybe do a

377
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:52,662
first pilot. And then we also have options to basically

378
00:23:52,838 --> 00:23:55,958
modernize your data foundation as well. So there are

379
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:59,726
a couple of ways where we can help you, right? And then reach out to

380
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,554
AWS generative AI Innovation center to help you more.

381
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:07,422
These are some two very good workshops. This is

382
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:10,486
a very technical, dive deep workshop. So if
