00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,256
Hello everyone. Thank you for joining me at Conf 42. Today we are

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,880
going to learn about dynamic user interfaces, harnessing AI, and machine learning

3
00:00:33,912 --> 00:00:37,112
for personalized, emotion aware experience. Picture this.

4
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:40,872
You are about to watch a movie and your tv already knows what you

5
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:43,832
are in the mood for. Or you are playing a game in an adjust the

6
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:47,400
difficulty because it can tell you are getting frustrated. Sounds like magic,

7
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:51,416
right? It's all thanks to AI and machine learning. Today we are diving

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,972
into how these technologies are transforming our interactions with devices,

9
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:58,572
making them more personalized and even more emotionally aware. Ready to see

10
00:00:58,588 --> 00:01:00,384
the future? Let's go.

11
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:06,324
So what's on our magical mystery to today?

12
00:01:06,404 --> 00:01:09,860
We'll start with a quick history lesson on user interfaces, then see

13
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:13,940
how AI is making them super smart. We'll check out some emotional aware tech

14
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:18,164
that's straight out of Sci-Fi dive into cool real world examples,

15
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,104
peak into the future, and wrap up with some important ethical stuff.

16
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:27,286
The evolution of user interfaces first,

17
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,830
stop the past. Remember the days of command line

18
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:34,262
interfaces? It was like speaking another language just to use

19
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:37,998
a computer. Then came graphical user interfaces with

20
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:41,774
windows and icons. Much better. Mobile and touch

21
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:45,430
interfaces made everything super intuitive. Just tap

22
00:01:45,502 --> 00:01:48,654
and swipe. And now we have voice assistants

23
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:52,184
like Siri and Alexa and mind blowing AR and VR

24
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:55,960
experiences. You all must have heard about the Apple illusion Pro and

25
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:59,456
Meta's quest, so you know what I'm talking about.

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,804
The evolution of user interfaces has been a wild ride.

27
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:06,840
The role of AI in user interfaces let's talk

28
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:10,352
about how AI is shaking things up. Personalization is

29
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:14,040
the name of the game. AI learns what you like and

30
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:18,052
gives you more of it. Ever wonder how Netflix knows you so well?

31
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:22,492
Like you are streaming a couple of Marvel

32
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:26,060
movies or maybe some science fiction drama?

33
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:29,732
And then a week later, when you open up

34
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:33,116
Netflix on a Saturday night, all you're looking at is a

35
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,948
lot of content that is tailored fit for you. That's AI

36
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:40,356
at work. Emotion aware systems take it up a notch by

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,652
reading your emotions. Yep, your device can now sense if

38
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:47,534
you're happy, sad, or even frustrated. And adaptive

39
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:50,646
interfaces change in real time based on what you're doing.

40
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,754
It's like having a digital buddy who just gets you.

41
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:59,874
Let's talk about Apple's dynamic interface.

42
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,694
This isn't completely new and has existed in limited

43
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:07,086
forms for a long time. Technically, the battery meter

44
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,398
on your smartphone is a type of dynamic UI. It will

45
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:12,954
change color as you process through it.

46
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:17,240
These types of use cases are obvious, but what

47
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:20,656
we are seeing now are more interesting and nuanced ways to leverage dynamic

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,536
UI the best example is Apple's latest iPhone.

49
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,656
You all must have heard of Dynamic island, which is the

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,616
notch that has moved down on the interface and now has interactive elements

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,544
playing around it. And it also has cool features,

52
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,004
a lot of cool features.

53
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:43,428
So Apple is great at doing this. MacOS has adaptive

54
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:46,892
dark and light modes based on time. IOS 16

55
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:50,380
started to do this with lock screens. They leverage modes of

56
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:53,372
focus to then show you custom lock screens, wallpaper,

57
00:03:53,428 --> 00:03:57,340
widgets and more. Now these lock screens are mainly manual

58
00:03:57,412 --> 00:04:01,180
and can be engineered through automation. For example, iOS can

59
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:04,436
turn a mode on based on a location that you have, but that

60
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,944
needs to be set up by you in the first instance. You can use Apple's

61
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:11,804
shortcuts and a couple of other features to do this.

62
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:15,520
Customizability has always been a push for a digital product,

63
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:18,832
and one hypothesis here is that even Apple,

64
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:22,760
who's steered towards strict design with their

65
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:26,324
products, are now bowing down to Gen Z's driven demand.

66
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:30,856
Ways to leverage dynamic UI the cool thing about this is the

67
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,552
number of use cases one could have for mobile and wearable devices. These things

68
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,704
track all sorts of measurements, the Apple Watch being a great example. These things

69
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:41,672
are just the health trackers example.

70
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:44,656
They have features like temperature sensing, sleep tracking,

71
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,216
ECG, health notifications for

72
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,272
your heart and blood oxygen. Outside of wearables,

73
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:56,284
there's plenty that digital products can do to leverage dynamic uis.

74
00:04:56,704 --> 00:05:00,416
Adapt core functionality as this will be used the most, and tailoring

75
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,746
to specific circumstances can be very helpful.

76
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,414
Tracking different data points to bring more specific information

77
00:05:06,494 --> 00:05:10,094
to light at key moments, create intuitive changes like

78
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:13,422
location and time. Manual customizations when you have a large

79
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:17,394
amount of super users so they can control their usage too.

80
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:21,142
Imagine logging into your favorite app and seeing everything tailored just for

81
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:24,678
you. That's the magic of personalization. AI analyzes

82
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:27,990
your habits and preferences, giving you the perfect content. It's like

83
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:30,950
having a personal assistant who knows exactly what you want.

84
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:34,212
Netflix's movie recommendations are Amazon's product suggestions.

85
00:05:34,318 --> 00:05:37,696
They are spot on because AI is behind the scenes, making sure you are

86
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,136
happy. Now let's get emotional. We'll talk about

87
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,684
emotional aware systems.

88
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:47,440
Literally, emotional aware systems use AI to understand your

89
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,864
feelings. Facial recognization can tell if you are happy

90
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:54,336
or sad. Voice analysis picks up on your mood from your

91
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,736
tone, and text analysis figures out your feelings from what you

92
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,490
type. These systems make interactions so

93
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:04,930
much more engaging and human like. Imagine a game that

94
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:08,330
eases up when you are frustrated, or a customer service bot that's

95
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:11,730
genuinely empathetic when you're upset. So let's talk about

96
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:15,562
the benefits of these emotional aware systems. Why do

97
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:19,242
we want our tech to understand our emotions? Has anybody ever asked this question?

98
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:22,754
That's because it makes everything better, more engaging interactions,

99
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:26,938
higher satisfaction, and greater loyalty. When your

100
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:30,146
tech knows how you feel, it can respond in ways that makes you

101
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,176
feel valued and understood. It's like having a super attentive friend who's always

102
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,600
there for you. So what are the

103
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:42,040
AI models that can help understand

104
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:46,312
and personalize your interfaces and also

105
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:50,424
show emotional awareness? Let's talk about AI

106
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:54,032
models for personalization and emotional awareness. Here is the

107
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:57,592
geek part. The AI models behind all is magic.

108
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,664
Supervised learning uses labeled data to make predictions.

109
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:05,250
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labels.

110
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:08,450
And the reinforcement? Learning is all about learning from experience.

111
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:12,218
It's like training a dog with treats. These models help AI understand

112
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,578
and respond to our preferences and emotions, making our interactions

113
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:19,338
seamless and intuitive. Integration of AI

114
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:22,666
and ML in UIs let's break down how

115
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,242
all of this works. First, we collect tons of data from user interactions,

116
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:31,226
clicks, browsing history, you name it. Then we train AI models to

117
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,696
predict your preferences and emotions. Real time

118
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,960
adoption is where the magic happens. The interfaces change based on what you're doing

119
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:42,672
right now. And of course, we need powerful computers to handle all of

120
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:46,088
this processing. And we have to keep your data safe and private.

121
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:48,884
It's a complex but fascinating process.

122
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:56,976
Let's go through a few case studies to understand how personalization

123
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,784
and emotional awareness works. So, case study one. Personalized learning

124
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:03,930
platforms lets see this in

125
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:07,842
action with personalized learning platforms, these AI driven

126
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:10,802
systems customize educational content for each student.

127
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:14,370
They analyze learning history and suggest the best materials.

128
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:17,458
For example, at the Southern Nevada Urban Micro Academy,

129
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:20,730
AI recommends lessons tailored to each students needs.

130
00:08:20,842 --> 00:08:24,314
And during the pandemic, platforms like Prender helped students

131
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:27,746
learn at their own pace, leading to better engagement and

132
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,344
performance. AI makes learning fun and effective.

133
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:35,516
So what happened to the results? Studies in real world applications have shown

134
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,956
that these platforms significantly improve learning outcomes.

135
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,364
For instance, schools using AI driven platforms reported higher

136
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:45,104
engagement levels and better completion rates among students.

137
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:50,396
Let's go to case study two. Let's go to case study two.

138
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,180
Emotion aware gaming emotional

139
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:57,932
aware gaming involves integrating AI to detect and respond to the emotional

140
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:01,434
status of players, creating a more immersive

141
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:05,210
and engaging gaming experience. By understanding a player's emotions,

142
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:09,234
games can adapt in real time to enhance enjoyment and maintain

143
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:12,730
engagement. Are there any gamers

144
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:15,954
here? This one's for you. Emotional aware gaming uses

145
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:19,234
AI to detect your feelings and adjust the games accordingly. Facial recognition

146
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:22,426
and voice analysis gauge your emotions

147
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,146
and the game adapts, lowering difficulty if you're frustrated or ramping

148
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,092
up the challenge if you're bored. This dynamic adaption keeps

149
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:33,292
you engaged and makes gaming even more immersive and enjoyable. It's like having a

150
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:35,264
game that's always in sync with your mood.

151
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:39,332
Looking ahead, the future is bright and super exciting.

152
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:43,196
AR and VR are already giving us immersive experiences, but we are just scratching the

153
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,732
surface. Brain computer interfaces are next, allowing us

154
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:49,844
to control devices with our thoughts. How cool is that?

155
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,764
Future interfaces will be more natural and intuitive with voice and gesture

156
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:57,786
recognition. Making tech feel like a natural expansion

157
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,090
of ourselves. And multimodal emphasis will blend voice,

158
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:04,574
touch and gestures for seamless interactions.

159
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:09,786
Looking ahead, the future is bright and super exciting. AR and VR

160
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,506
are already giving us immersive experiences, but we are just scratching the surface.

161
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,082
Brain computer interfaces are next, allowing us to control

162
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:19,874
devices with our thoughts. How cool is that?

163
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:23,872
Future interfaces will be more natural and intuitive with

164
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:27,816
vision and gesture recognition, making tech feel like a natural expansion of

165
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,736
ourselves. And multi model interfaces will blend voice, touch and gestures for

166
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,344
seamless interactions. You can already see there's

167
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,352
a new company that has just come out called Human AI,

168
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:41,872
which tried a similar experience

169
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,244
for users. They launched AI product

170
00:10:46,264 --> 00:10:50,048
that has no screens, no digital touch interface,

171
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:53,874
and all is done through your audio, your voice.

172
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:58,678
The device just captures what's in front of you and recognizes

173
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:02,430
what you're doing or what you're looking at. It'll just understand

174
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:06,038
and explain you what it means. Let's talk about a

175
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:09,438
couple of ethical considerations. With great power

176
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:12,806
comes great responsibility. As we innovate, we must address

177
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,734
ethical issues. Data privacy and security are top priorities.

178
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:20,750
We need transparency in how AI makes decisions and accountability for

179
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:24,140
those decisions. And we must prevent biases to ensure

180
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:28,060
fairness in AI applications, clear communication and informed consent are

181
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:30,544
essential to maintaining trust and integrity.

182
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:36,604
As we continue to innovate, let's ensure our advancements are inclusive,

183
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:40,060
fair and sustainable. Together, we can create a digital world that not only meets our

184
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:43,144
needs, but also makes us feel understood and valued.

185
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:48,424
Alright, let's wrap this up with a fun challenge. Imagine the possibilities.

186
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:52,536
What new dynamic UI would you create with AI and ML?

187
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,048
Maybe a virtual shopping assistant that knows your style, or a learning

188
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:59,496
platform that evolves with your interests? The sky's the limit. As we

189
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,192
move forward, let's make sure our innovations are inclusive, fair and sustainable.

190
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:06,656
Together, we can create a digital world that not only meets our

191
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,832
needs, but also makes us feel truly understood

192
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:14,240
and valued. This is Yashran Kotha

193
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:15,344
and thanks for watching.
