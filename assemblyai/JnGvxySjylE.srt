This is why repair a burning house with me Richard Tweed

2
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:32,402
this is a collection of hard won learnings

3
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:36,434
from hundreds of software incidents. It is not a guide

4
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:40,166
to the process of incidents management. At the end

5
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:43,800
of this, there'll be some links to examples of those.

6
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,880
Think of this as common behaviors and

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,670
challenges I see for folks during incidents.

8
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,846
Also, try and guess which book influenced these slides and send

9
00:00:56,868 --> 00:01:00,398
me a message afterwards. Key takeaways from this are going

10
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:04,274
to be mitigate don't fix clear

11
00:01:04,392 --> 00:01:08,210
communication and ownership learn from mistakes.

12
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,194
Things go wrong all the time and should

13
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:16,294
I declare an incident? Yes. What is an

14
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:19,240
incident? Why have I written this?

15
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,414
An incident is a coordinated response to

16
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:26,966
mitigate an issue. Now that we know what

17
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:30,986
an incident is, we should know what to do. So for

18
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,218
our burning house, this would be declaring an incidents to put out the

19
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:38,214
fire and get everyone to safety, clear communication

20
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:41,226
and ownership. During incidents,

21
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:44,894
someone should know what's going on,

22
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:48,750
and everybody involved should know what they're meant to be doing and

23
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,774
when. Depending on what happens during that incident

24
00:01:52,922 --> 00:01:56,322
and how critical a problem it is,

25
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:59,954
you'll either have the bystander effect, somebody else is

26
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:02,420
already fixing this right?

27
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,266
Or you'll encounter the exact opposite where everyone's

28
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:10,674
trying to be a hero, trying to help, but they only succeed

29
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:14,534
in getting in everyone else's way. These can usually be

30
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:18,486
avoided by having clear responsibility for coordinating

31
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:22,022
the response. This is normally done by a role called the incident

32
00:02:22,086 --> 00:02:26,234
manager. You will also have someone

33
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:30,050
who is hands on keyboard for the mitigation,

34
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,014
often called the operations lead. Another way that you

35
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:37,626
can avoid these issues is by clearly telling

36
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,710
somebody what you want done and when you want updates.

37
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,666
The person organizing the incident manager should not

38
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:49,346
be the one fixing anything. They should

39
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:53,570
be focused on making sure everyone else has what they need and that

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,000
at least they know what's going on.

41
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,282
During an incident, you should also do explicit handovers,

42
00:03:01,426 --> 00:03:04,786
so at the beginning there'll only be one person, but over time you'll

43
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:08,626
have more people doing more things. So whenever you're handing

44
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:12,090
over those responsibilities, do it explicitly.

45
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,074
For example, say you need a break, which you will.

46
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:19,738
You can go to the person who you're handing it over to and say,

47
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,750
will you take over as incident manager?

48
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,782
Okay, you are now the incident manager. I will see you

49
00:03:26,836 --> 00:03:30,878
in. So in our house fire example,

50
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,080
the incident manager would be the person who finds the fire.

51
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,014
They would then hand over that responsibility to the firefighters.

52
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:42,194
Once they arrive, they would then brief them about how many people

53
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:45,650
are expected to be in the building, how far the fire has spread,

54
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,760
and any other relevant information at that point.

55
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,122
Similarly, it's very common for decision paralysis

56
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:57,286
to set in, burning important incidents to

57
00:03:57,308 --> 00:04:00,860
reduce this what you're going to do

58
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,474
and ask whether they disagree. Don't just

59
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,738
ask open ended questions of what should we do.

60
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:11,440
If you're having trouble getting decisions from people.

61
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,030
Engineers and developers love correcting something

62
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,782
or someone that's wrong, please, please write

63
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:24,050
things down. Having a record of who thought

64
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,194
what, what was done and why

65
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:31,934
is invaluable for getting people who join

66
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:35,986
later up to speed and getting them effective promptly.

67
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:39,814
It's also very useful for the write up afterwards and seeing

68
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:42,470
what can be improved before the next incident.

69
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,386
Don't fix most developers,

70
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:49,894
when faced with an issue, will dive directly into

71
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:53,660
the source code to try and find the bug and create a fix.

72
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,814
Sorry to break it to you, but this is a complete waste

73
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:00,354
of your time in these situations,

74
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:03,070
especially at the start of an incident.

75
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,390
If it's long running, there may be some cause for this.

76
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,942
But yeah, during an incident your focus must

77
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:14,654
be on preventing things getting worse and mitigating

78
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:18,782
the existing issue. Regardless of how fast your CI

79
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:21,742
system is and how robust you're testing,

80
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:26,070
developing a fix and testing it to the standards of your team

81
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,958
will take too long. It also ignores the

82
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:34,070
very real possibilities that the fix makes things worse.

83
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,306
An incident is not an excuse to ignore everything you've learned

84
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,434
about safe code practices. If you

85
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:44,746
need help from other teams, don't be afraid to

86
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:47,994
ask for it. Page them if you need to and ask for help.

87
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:50,090
The priority is mitigation.

88
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,850
To use the burning house analogy, you shouldn't be installing

89
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,494
a replacement wooden stairwell while it's still on

90
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:02,046
fire. Put the fire out. Then you can

91
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:05,506
plan your rebuild or your remodel. Things go

92
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:09,198
wrong all the time. When an incident is declared,

93
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:13,406
there can be an instinct to panic or to rush to conclusions.

94
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,478
The best thing you can do is take a moment to work out what's actually

95
00:06:17,564 --> 00:06:21,766
going on and coordinate with others to actually investigate the issue

96
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:25,526
and eventually mitigate it. If you see a fire,

97
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:29,674
it is better by far to check how far it has spread and

98
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:33,270
whether there are any extinguishers of the correct type nearby.

99
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,162
Rather than blindly grabbing the closest one and

100
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:40,640
using a water extinguisher on an oil fire,

101
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,110
have a look at a video of that. It's pretty dramatic.

102
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,040
So for our house example,

103
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,262
everyone burns toast, drops a bug and

104
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:55,106
throws a switch remote at the TV. Okay, maybe just me

105
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:58,770
for the last one. Learn from mistakes

106
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,674
once the incident has based learn everything you

107
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:06,290
can from an incident. Don't just fix the bug.

108
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,798
They're a tremendous way to learn how your systems work,

109
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:13,842
how your processes work. What's people's natural

110
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:17,590
instincts? They aren't necessarily what you would expect

111
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,034
from talking to people during the normal nine to

112
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:24,858
five. You could learn, for example, that your

113
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,202
silence and escalate buttons are too close together

114
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:31,486
for your 04:00 a.m.. Brain. And now you've woken up

115
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:34,990
a director. Or you could find out that

116
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,206
your runbooks, your readmes, your documentation, your training

117
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:41,742
only references the old name of the service rather

118
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:45,506
than the new one. So you had to spend half an hour

119
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:49,540
or an hour trying to work out what this thing could possibly be.

120
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,810
We learned to use the switch remote straps.

121
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,082
Also, it's incredibly likely in an incident

122
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:01,654
that many of your preparations, maybe even

123
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:04,600
all of them, will be forgotten in the heat of the moment.

124
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,174
Try and remember that fact. Then try and remember your training and

125
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:13,146
experience. As long as you get back on track, it doesn't matter if

126
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:16,346
you started on the wrong foot for a house fire,

127
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:20,106
you might be so preoccupied with the flames that you see that

128
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:23,840
you forget to get out of the house to get out of the fire.

129
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,014
Should I declare an incident? If you're wondering whether

130
00:08:28,052 --> 00:08:32,094
to declare an incident, do. The fact you're wondering at all means

131
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:35,982
it's worthy of investigation. As mentioned before, if an incident

132
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:38,610
is called and turns out to be unnecessary,

133
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,410
then delve into why. Use the five whys technique.

134
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,882
It's another opportunity to learn and improve.

135
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,950
If your dashboards are always red because you misconfigured a threshold,

136
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,200
fix it so that you're not in that situation again.

137
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,342
A fire alarm screaming because you burn toast is

138
00:08:58,396 --> 00:09:01,618
far better than the alarm not going off when there's

139
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:05,042
a real electrical fire. Just to repeat,

140
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:09,080
the key takeaways from this were mitigate. Don't fix

141
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,054
clear communication and ownership. Learn from

142
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:16,640
mistakes. Things go wrong all the time.

143
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,842
And should I declare an incident? If you're wondering,

144
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:24,794
yes. Here are some useful resources.

145
00:09:24,922 --> 00:09:28,270
There are entire books written about this, so if it's something you're interested

146
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,718
in,
