00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,344
Welcome to the conf session on advanced mixing port of warfare.

2
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:31,020
So this talk will be about how different quantum technologies can assist

3
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:33,584
modern warfare in improvising their performance.

4
00:00:34,964 --> 00:00:38,628
So this will be the slow of this talk. I will start with the definition

5
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:42,316
followed by the main components of the quantum technology. Then I will discuss

6
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,540
different warfare mechanisms followed by later section on

7
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:49,744
global progress. Then I will go through the challenges in concluding revamps.

8
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:53,932
Let's start with the down quantum workfare in simple perks.

9
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:57,756
It refers to the utilization of quantum technologies for military strategies,

10
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,358
operations and weapon systems. It uses the superior cover bridges

11
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:05,166
of quantum advancements, which surpass traditional methods in encryption

12
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,710
data processing. In environmental sciences, these innovations can

13
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:12,534
connectively optimize logistics, improve the decision making processes,

14
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,594
and enhance the performance of autonomous systems.

15
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:20,038
The foundational principles of quantum mechanics were established in

16
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,910
the early 20th century, with the contribution by Max Planck, Albert Einstein,

17
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:27,318
Nielsburg, etcetera. These early developments were purely

18
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:31,022
theoretical and not connected to webpage. Then, during the Cold War era,

19
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,254
both the United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily

20
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,870
in scientific research, including quantum mechanics. So while the

21
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:41,598
primary focus was on nuclear and conventional arms, there was also some

22
00:01:41,646 --> 00:01:45,366
theoretical research into quantum effects in various other technologies

23
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,374
like radar, cryptography, etcetera. Following that, in the 1980s,

24
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:53,822
quantum gate distribution was proposed, which laid the groundwork for secure communication

25
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:57,636
methods, and this could theoretically be applied to military communications as

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,660
well. Then, in the 21st century, advancements in quantum computing

27
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:05,076
and sensing technologies started showing potential military applications.

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,052
Governments and defense organizations began exploring these technologies

29
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:12,700
for secure communication, advanced sensing and navigation systems.

30
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:16,180
Today, countries like the united states, China,

31
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:19,264
etc. Are heavily investing in quantum technology research,

32
00:02:20,124 --> 00:02:23,332
military applications, and this includes quantum radar,

33
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:27,414
quantum sensing for submarines, quantum communication satellites, and so on.

34
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:33,146
The current research on the quantum technology can be classified into three main components,

35
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,734
quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing.

36
00:02:37,714 --> 00:02:41,066
Let's start with the quantum computing part. It's when you use the

37
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,114
principles of quantum mechanics for performing operations and computation.

38
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:48,770
This is done with the help of a quantum quantum computer uses qubits instead of

39
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:52,482
classical bits. So these quantum computers come in various types,

40
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:55,666
each based on different principles and technologies. For example,

41
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,328
IBM and Google use superconducting qubit based quantum computers.

42
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:03,416
Then we have ironq and Honeywell, which uses trapped irons, quantum annealers by

43
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,696
d five, and so on. Each type of quantum computer has

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,608
its own strengths and challenges. They are specifically used to solve complex

45
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:14,744
problems. So these quantum computers usually function as subroutines

46
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:18,280
within classical computer programs, with classical systems managing

47
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:22,424
the main control and performing tasks less efficient for quantum processing.

48
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:25,880
Due to their size and need for cryogenics, quantum computers

49
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:29,504
are unlikely to be personal devices in the near future. Instead,

50
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:32,830
they are accessed by cloud services offered by platforms such

51
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:36,510
as Microsoft and Amazon Prickett, which integrate quantum computing

52
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:40,434
resources from various manufacturers into a unified ecosystem.

53
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,206
Now let's see some aspects of quantum computing. The first one

54
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,030
is quantum machine learning and artificial intelligence. Quantum computing's

55
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,846
properties like superposition, parallel computation, and integral

56
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,438
wind have garnered significant interest across various scientific

57
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,406
and engineering fields, which has led efforts to adapt classical machine learning

58
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,084
algorithms for quantum computing, particularly during the NISC

59
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:08,300
era. Quantum operating's probabilistic nature and parallelism promise

60
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:11,908
advancement and semi supervised approaches such as reinforcement

61
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:15,484
learning and vision networks. Another one is quantum enhanced MLAI,

62
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:19,076
so they enhance specific machine learning tasks like quantum sampling,

63
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,820
linear algebra operations, and quantum neural networks. The quantum

64
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:25,464
memory and algorithms are still in the development phase.

65
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:30,328
Now let's see the role of quantum ML and AI for mimicry.

66
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:33,616
Quantum enhanced pattern recognition can identify objects,

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,368
patterns and anomalies in data the classical algorithms

68
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,640
might miss. This is valuable for tasks such as detecting hidden

69
00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:44,000
terrorist networks, predicting enemy movements, recognizing threats,

70
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:48,048
etcetera. It can be also useful for accurately predicting potential

71
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:51,536
future conflicts and scenarios, which enables military planners to

72
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,624
develop proactive strategies and plans. Also, QML can process massive

73
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:59,696
datasets much faster than classical machine learning algorithms. This capability

74
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,470
is crucial for analyzing intelligence data from various resources such

75
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:07,078
as satellite images, communication intercepts, and social media.

76
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:10,590
Then, with the assistance of quantum ML and AI, they can

77
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:14,686
significantly improve the performance of the automated defense mechanisms

78
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,070
that respond to cyber threats in real time. This is by reducing response

79
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:23,078
times and reducing damage from cyberattacks, which includes UAV's

80
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:25,958
autonomous drone vehicles and maritime drones.

81
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:30,174
It can also enhance military wargaming and simulation by providing more

82
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:33,942
accurate and realistic models of combat scenarios, which allows for

83
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:37,468
better training and preparation as well as the development of more effective

84
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:40,740
strategies. So there are still some major challenges.

85
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:44,364
Quantum computers are highly prone to errors due to their delicate

86
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:48,564
quantum screens. Error correction is a significant challenge as it requires

87
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:52,084
quantum error correcting codes to to detect incorrect errors

88
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:55,412
without disturbing the quantum information and developing these

89
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:59,604
codes and implementing them efficiently remains a major hurdle.

90
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:03,188
Next is developing quantum algorithms, which can actually show

91
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:06,900
improvement over classical algorithms. So also,

92
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:11,004
classical machine learning algorithms do not have straightforward quantum

93
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:14,668
equivalency in general. So developing new quantum algorithms

94
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:18,588
that can handle the ML task while being practically implementable on quantum

95
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:22,036
hardware is an ongoing area of research. Coming to the data

96
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,924
part. Classical data needs to be encoded into quantum stage for implementation

97
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:29,444
of quantum computers. This encoding process can be challenging

98
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:33,578
limiting the practical application of QML. Next, we have quantum

99
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:37,234
memory, which is essential for storing quantum information reliably

100
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:41,154
over time. However, creating stable and long lasting quantum memory

101
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,578
is challenging due to decolons and noise which have corrupt

102
00:06:44,626 --> 00:06:47,914
stored quantum information. It is also an important ongoing

103
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:51,554
area of research as it would enable the retention and retrieval of quantum

104
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:54,938
data necessary for storing complex competition

105
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:56,694
and long term projects.

106
00:06:57,914 --> 00:07:01,650
Another important aspect is quantum optimization. The optimization

107
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:05,466
is in the quite important for balanced functioning of large systems

108
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,866
and resources, and quantum optimization provides techniques

109
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,814
to solve these complex problems.

110
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:16,402
They are particularly useful for np hard problems which become impractical to

111
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:19,522
solve otherwise. The brute force has complexity increases.

112
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:23,290
One such algorithm is QAOA, which combines quantum operations with

113
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:26,906
classical optimization techniques to find approximate solutions to

114
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,978
optimization problems. Cuba is another approach

115
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:33,890
used in quantum optimization, particularly suitable for analog quantum

116
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:37,530
computers. It involves transforming your optimization problem into

117
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:41,410
a form that can be tackled by quantum annealers or other quantum devices.

118
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:45,314
Quantum inspired classical algorithms derived from quantum methods like

119
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:49,418
QAO may also provide performance improvements without requiring

120
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:52,994
quantum. Various demonstrations and

121
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:55,986
proof of concept applications in sectors like traffic,

122
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,168
logistics, and finance highlight the practical utility of quantum optimization,

123
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:02,964
especially using analog quantum computing.

124
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,304
Now we see its role in military. So first application we have

125
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:11,896
is in mission planning and scheduling, which includes determining the sequence

126
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,960
of operations to optimize the effectiveness of the mission.

127
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:19,024
Effective planning and scheduling are crucial for coordinating multiple

128
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:22,384
games and assets, minimizing risk, and adapting to changing

129
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:26,304
rotations. Next is the resource allocation, which refers to the optimal

130
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:29,734
distribution of limited resources to various tasks projects.

131
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:33,270
In a military context, this involves assigning personnel, equipment,

132
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:36,790
and funding to operations where the impact can be maximized.

133
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:40,758
Then we have another decision making process, like all

134
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:44,126
general decision making processes, which involve gathering and

135
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,390
analyzing relevant data, considering various alternatives,

136
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:50,806
and choosing the best course of action. And it is necessary for making

137
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,598
well informed, timely decisions that maximize mission effectiveness

138
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:58,092
and minimize risk. Then, one of the well known applications,

139
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:01,804
logistics and supply chain management, which is coordinating

140
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:05,220
and managing the flow of goods, services, and information from origin

141
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:08,956
to destination. In a military context, this ensures that troops have

142
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,944
the necessary supplies, equipment, and support to carry out their missions.

143
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:17,612
Here are some challenges as well. The first one is converting classical

144
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:20,892
optimization problems into quantum formats that can be effectively

145
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:24,584
processed by quantum assets algorithms. Then, creating systems that integrate

146
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:28,480
quantum and classical computing to leverage the strengths of both is necessary but

147
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:32,604
challenging due to differences in computational paradigms and architectures.

148
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:37,256
Next is scalability. Scaling quantum computational solutions to

149
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,624
handle large military operations and logistics is a complex

150
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,920
task that requires significant computational resources and

151
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:48,414
infrastructure. Apart from this, there are several other algorithms.

152
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:52,234
Quantum searching algorithms such as Grover's algorithm and quantum random

153
00:09:52,274 --> 00:09:55,746
work mechanisms, offer significant speedup for unstructured data

154
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,010
analysis. The HHL algorithm shows potential for

155
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:02,378
superpolina will speed up in solving linear equations beneficial

156
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:06,274
for fields requiring large scale numerical simulations despite

157
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:09,546
practical resource constraints. Some other examples are

158
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,698
quantum phase estimation and variational techniques like VQe,

159
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,134
which are dominant approaches for quantum stimulation.

160
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:21,924
Now, let's look at the timeline of the future progress. Quantum computing

161
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:25,084
is advancing rapidly. Current quantum computers, such as

162
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,796
those developed by IBM, Google, etc. Have demonstrated the capability to

163
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,108
perform specific computations faster than classical computers for

164
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:35,060
particular tasks, which is known as quantum supremacy.

165
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:38,468
However, these systems are still in the Nisk era,

166
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:41,540
characterized by noisy qubits and limited error correction.

167
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:45,020
So in the next five years, improvements in quantum error correction and

168
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:48,654
qubit coherence times are expected. Quantum computing will be

169
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:53,006
increasingly used for specialized applications such as optimization problems,

170
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,474
complex simulations, and machine learning in academia industry.

171
00:10:57,134 --> 00:11:00,990
In next ten years, quantum computers with hundreds to thousands of

172
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:04,766
qubits could emerge and are being more complex. In practical applications.

173
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,902
We may see more robust, error corrected quantum computers that can outperform

174
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,286
classical systems in a wider range of tasks. Then in

175
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,800
the next ten to 20 years, fully fault tolerate quantum computers

176
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:19,544
could become a reality, revolutionizing fields such as cryptography,

177
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:22,816
material science, and drug discovery. Practical, large scale

178
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,232
quantum computers with millions of qubits could solve problems currently intractable

179
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:29,164
for practical computers.

180
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:34,728
The next component is quantum communication. It is transmitting quantum

181
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:38,712
information using fibers of three space channels with quantum communication

182
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:42,548
protocols. Quantum communication protocols suggest quantum key

183
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:45,900
distribution enable the exchange of cryptographic keys with

184
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:50,108
theoretically unconditional security, as any attempted eavesdropping

185
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:53,732
can be detected due to the disturbance it causes to the quantum states

186
00:11:53,788 --> 00:11:57,468
being transmitted. Quantum communication and cryptography research

187
00:11:57,556 --> 00:12:01,156
focuses on developing quantum safe cryptographic algorithms to

188
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,636
secure data against potential threats from quantum computers,

189
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,664
ensuring long term data security and privacy.

190
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:12,390
Slide the first aspect of quantum communication, which is

191
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:15,766
quantum key distribution or key QK did so.

192
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,518
QKIt is designed to securely distribute a secret key between parties

193
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:22,966
for encrypting data over classical channels. It uses the

194
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,782
no cloning theorem to ensure that any eavesdropper is detectable

195
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:30,326
due to the disturbance caused by measurement. Unlike classical

196
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,566
encryption, which can be potentially broken with powerful quantum

197
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,424
computing computers, QKD uses quantum bits or qubits that change

198
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:41,240
state when observed and hence preventing eavesdropping without detection.

199
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:44,848
So there are two main protocols, BB 84 and E 91.

200
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:48,720
The BB 84 protocol, which requires pre distributed quiz and

201
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:52,672
quantum random number generation, is simpler technically. In contrast,

202
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:56,248
the E 91 protocol uses quantum entanglement to generate

203
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:59,864
keys during distribution, which makes it more complex with not

204
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,180
requiring pre generated randomness numbers. And so some of

205
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:07,284
these products are commercially available in the market, and further research

206
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:10,884
is also going on. So now let's see the

207
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:14,668
role in military QKD provides theoretically unbreakable encryption.

208
00:13:14,716 --> 00:13:17,268
When using the principle of quantum mechanics,

209
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:21,244
maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information is paramount in military

210
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:24,508
operations. QKD ensures that communications between command

211
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:28,204
centers, troops, and other military assets remain confidential

212
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:32,496
and secure from interception by adversaries. Next is secure satellite

213
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,184
based communication satellites equipped with QKD technology can

214
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:39,364
establish secure communication links over long distances,

215
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:43,624
overcoming the range limitations of terrestrial QKD systems,

216
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:47,448
and this is particularly important for global military operations and coordination

217
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,924
between geographically dispersed units.

218
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:54,176
QKT can facilitate real time secure communication

219
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,942
between military satellites and ground stations,

220
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:00,486
ensuring that commands and intelligence are transmitted securely

221
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,350
and without any delay. Military networks that control critical

222
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:07,622
infrastructure, such as missile defense systems and surveillance

223
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:11,222
networks, can use QKD to protect against cyber attacks

224
00:14:11,238 --> 00:14:15,606
and unauthorized access. Here are some challenges as well.

225
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,574
Implementing QKD on a large scale, such as across an entire military

226
00:14:19,614 --> 00:14:23,646
network, is difficult due to the need for point to point connections and

227
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,270
the lack of efficient quantum repeaters. This limitation makes it

228
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:30,964
terrain challenging to deploy QKD broadly without significant

229
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:35,180
advancements in network architecture. Integrating QKD with existing

230
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:38,868
military communication infrastructures poses significant challenges.

231
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:42,876
Current systems are based on classical technologies, and transitioning

232
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,292
to QPT would require substantial upgrades and potentially a

233
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:50,356
complete overhaul of existing networks. QPT systems require

234
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,396
specific and often expensive hardware, such as single photon detectors and

235
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,462
sources, quantum repeaters, and high precision synchronization tools.

236
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:02,186
This specialized infrastructure is not readily available in

237
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,786
many existing military communication networks. QCD is

238
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,218
highly effective over short distances but faces significant

239
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:13,730
challenges over long distances due to photon loss and decoherence.

240
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:17,474
While optical fibers can transmit QKD signals over tens to

241
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:20,874
hundreds of kilometers, extending this range requires

242
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:24,342
complex and cost free solutions, such as quantum repeaters,

243
00:15:24,498 --> 00:15:26,994
which are still in development stages.

244
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:32,102
While QGIT is theoretically secure, practical implementations must account

245
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:35,510
for potential side channel attacks and physical tampering.

246
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:39,454
Ensuring that the entire QK systems, from hardware to software,

247
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:43,710
is secure against all possible attacks is complex and requires constant

248
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:46,902
vigilance. The sensitivity can cause signal loss,

249
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,624
breaking reliable operation in often harsh military environments.

250
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:53,888
Challenging the next

251
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:57,096
aspect is a quantum network, which is designed to

252
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,712
transmit qubits between spatially separated quantum processors.

253
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:04,816
The structure of quantum networks mirrors classical networks comprising end

254
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,184
nodes like quantum resizes communication lines,

255
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:11,904
optical switches, and quantum repeaters. Quantum networks

256
00:16:11,944 --> 00:16:15,776
enable secure and direct communication between quantum computers, allowing the

257
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,108
exchange of quantum data. This capability is crucial for the efficient redistribution

258
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:23,564
of computational tasks based on the performance of individual quantum

259
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:27,300
computers. It facilitates the division of large computational

260
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:31,284
tasks into smaller ones that can be processed simultaneously by multiple

261
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:35,300
quantum computers. Undistributed quantum computing, when numerous quantum

262
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:39,332
computers are networked together is likely to be the practical realization of scalable

263
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:42,676
quantum computing systems. And now we

264
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,316
see the role in military quantum position verification technique

265
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,152
can be used to verify the location of military assets and personnel without

266
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:54,168
revealing the

267
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:57,848
integration of quantum networks allows for distributed quantum computing

268
00:16:57,896 --> 00:17:02,104
where multiple quantum computers can work together to solve complex problems.

269
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:06,216
This can be particularly useful for military applications that require significant

270
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,536
computational power, such as cryptography, simulations and

271
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,416
data analysis. Quantum networks are inherently resilient to

272
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,268
tampering and eavesdropping due to the principles of quantum mechanics mechanics.

273
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:21,004
Any attempt to intercept or alter the quantum information transmitted

274
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:25,036
over the network would be detected, ensuring the reliability and integrity of

275
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,820
military communications and data transfer. Some of the challenges

276
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:32,860
are listed here. The first one is development and maintenance of

277
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:36,540
components like optical switches, so maintaining quantum components

278
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:40,364
is crucial. Quantum repeaters are necessary for long distance quantum

279
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:44,292
communication, but are still in the experimental system stage and developing practical,

280
00:17:44,348 --> 00:17:47,884
efficient quantum repeaters that can be deployed in military

281
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:51,572
networks as a significant hurdle. Depending on the application,

282
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:55,548
end nodes might need to handle single or multiple qubits.

283
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:59,756
They may also require quantum memory to store quantum information

284
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,824
temporarily, so this is also a challenge.

285
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:07,732
Next important aspect is post quantum cryptography PQC

286
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:11,556
so post quantum cryptography bears encryption techniques designed

287
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,292
to withstand future quantum computer attacks. While current asymmetric

288
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:18,964
encryption methods are vulnerable, symmetric cryptography algorithms

289
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:22,924
and hash functions are generally considered secure against quantum attacks.

290
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:26,540
Most current symmetric cryptographic algorithms and hash functions are

291
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,100
still secure against quantum attacks, and increasing key size can

292
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:33,028
mitigate risk posed by quantum algorithms. With growers,

293
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:36,964
algorithm cryptographers are creating new algorithms in anticipation

294
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:40,804
of q t, when current cryptographic methods will become vulnerable to quantum

295
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:44,084
liquidity. This can safeguard the integrity and authenticity

296
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:48,116
of relative data. One of the main challenges in post quantum cryptography

297
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,932
is considered to be the implementation of potentially quantum safe algorithms

298
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:55,236
into existing systems. So there are tests done,

299
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,304
for example, by Google, Microsoft, and Apple to ensure the security.

300
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:04,580
Here is the timeline for CTF. Quantum communication,

301
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:08,838
particularly quantum key distribution, is already being implemented in pilot

302
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:13,030
projects and limited commercial applications. Quantum communication networks

303
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:16,950
like the quantum Science satellite launched by China, have successfully

304
00:19:16,982 --> 00:19:20,990
demonstrated long distance quantum entanglement and secure communication

305
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:24,774
over hundreds of kilometers. So next five years we can see

306
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:28,350
expansion of jukery networks in urban and metropolitan areas for

307
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:31,978
secure communication and continued development of satellite

308
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:35,530
based quantum communication for long distance secure communication.

309
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:39,562
In next five to ten years, we can see the integration of quantum

310
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:43,154
communication protocols with classical Internet infrastructure

311
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:46,538
to create hybrid quantum classical networks and development

312
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:50,298
of quantum repeaters to extend the range of quantum communication.

313
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:54,498
In next ten to 20 years, there can be realization of a global quantum

314
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:58,126
Internet allowing secure communication across

315
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,990
continents. This will involve robust quantum repeaters and

316
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:06,594
satellite constellations to maintain quantum entanglement over long distances.

317
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:11,542
Let's move on to our next component, quantum sensei, which is one

318
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:15,102
of the replica advance in quantum technology and making it to the real

319
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:18,670
world. From laboratories, it refers to the use of quantum

320
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:22,398
properties to measure the physical quantities like magnetic and electrical

321
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:25,430
fields, temperature, pressure, time, frequency,

322
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:29,322
etcetera. So its strength lies in the inherent weakness of the quantum

323
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:32,514
systems, which is their instability against the external

324
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:37,146
environment. Using this, the quantum sensors offer unparalleled sensitivity

325
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,002
and precision in measuring, providing better stability and superior

326
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:43,974
performance compared to the conventional sensors.

327
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:50,618
The first aspect is quantum clock. Quantum clocks have highly precise

328
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,964
time keeping devices which utilize laser cooled single

329
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:58,188
ions confined in an electromagnetic track to achieve unprecedented

330
00:20:58,236 --> 00:21:01,764
accuracy. State of the art chip sized atomic clocks

331
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:05,132
achieve an uncertainty of two into ten to the power minus twelve.

332
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:09,076
By quantum logic. Single ion clocks have uncertainties as low

333
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,868
as nine into ten to the power -18 so this level of precision

334
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:16,172
allows quantum clocks to perform new types of measurements,

335
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:20,138
including the ability to measure height differences between points on earth

336
00:21:20,226 --> 00:21:24,394
with an accuracy of 1 cm. This opens up possibilities for

337
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:28,346
highly accurate gravitational potential measurements and other applications

338
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,054
where precision timing is crucial, such as satellite navigation,

339
00:21:32,954 --> 00:21:36,554
network and finance. OVC role

340
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:40,386
in military quantum clocks provide unprecedented accuracy in

341
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,130
time measurement, essential for navigation systems such as gps.

342
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:47,442
Precise timing ensures more accurate positioning,

343
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:51,490
crucial for military operations. Quantum clocks enable more accurate

344
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:54,794
timing in missile guidance systems, increasing the precision of

345
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:58,402
targeting and reducing the likelihood of collateral damage.

346
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:02,578
Precise timing is critical for the coordination of complex military

347
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:06,322
maneuvers and the synchronization of multi phase attacks. Also,

348
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:10,098
synchronization of communication networks ensures secure data transfer

349
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:13,564
between military units and command centers. Now we see some

350
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:17,260
challenges for military applications, the reliability and longevity of

351
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:20,396
quantum clocks are paramount. Ensuring long term stability

352
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,196
and minimal downtime is a critical challenge that must be addressed.

353
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,436
The power consumption of quantum clocks, especially those requiring cryogenic

354
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,172
cooling, is a critical concern. Developing energy efficient motors

355
00:22:32,228 --> 00:22:35,740
that can operate autonomously in the field that frequent

356
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,740
maintenance is essential for practical deployment. Quantum clocks

357
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:43,476
involve complexity that is currently not as compact

358
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,220
or portable as needed for various military

359
00:22:47,252 --> 00:22:51,380
platforms. Achieving miniaturization while maintaining accuracy and

360
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,944
stability is a significant technical work done.

361
00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:58,684
The next aspect we have is quantum radar. The quantum radar operates

362
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:02,268
similarly to classical radar by sending a signal towards

363
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:06,050
a target and waiting for the reflected signal. It utilizes

364
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:09,402
quantum features in both the radiation source and output detection to

365
00:23:09,418 --> 00:23:12,594
outperform classical return resistance, and for this it

366
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:17,294
leverages quantum mechanical effects such as the uncertainty principle and quantum entanglement.

367
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:21,938
Quantum radar can effectively counteract conventional retarding techniques,

368
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:25,634
so spoofing signals cannot match the original quantum state

369
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:28,994
of the radar's internal signal, allowing the system to filter out

370
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:33,574
these and other environmental sources and hence enhancing detection accuracy.

371
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:37,542
Quantum radar shares properties with noise radars, including preparative

372
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:40,114
detection and efficient spectrum sharing.

373
00:23:40,494 --> 00:23:44,278
Various protocols currently exist, such as interferometric quantum radar,

374
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:48,398
quantum illumination, hybrid quantum radar, three dimensional enhancement,

375
00:23:48,486 --> 00:23:51,714
each having its own requirements, strengths, and limitations.

376
00:23:55,494 --> 00:23:59,230
Now we see the ruling military a quantum radar can potentially

377
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:02,838
detect stealth aircraft and submarines that are designed to be invisible

378
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:06,166
to conventional radar systems. The higher sensitivity

379
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,870
and ability to distinguish signals from noise allows quantum

380
00:24:09,902 --> 00:24:13,470
radar to identify stealth targets more effectively

381
00:24:13,622 --> 00:24:17,686
then in electronic warfare. So quantum radar is less susceptible to jamming

382
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,862
and interference compared to traditional radar systems.

383
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:24,248
Its use of entangled photons and quantum illumination

384
00:24:24,336 --> 00:24:28,040
techniques can maintain signal integrity even in environments with significant

385
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:31,968
electronic countermeasures. Then, in maritime

386
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:35,424
applications, quantum radar can enhance the detection of submarines

387
00:24:35,464 --> 00:24:39,184
and underwater mines. The increased sensitivity and resolution of

388
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:42,944
quantum radar systems can help in identifying objects beneath

389
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:47,044
the water surface, which are typically challenging for conventional radar.

390
00:24:48,304 --> 00:24:51,856
This was particularly important important for maintaining the safety of satellites

391
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,444
and other space assists in an increasingly crowded space environment.

392
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:59,064
Now we see some challenges. So quantum radar systems

393
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:03,184
currently have limitations in range and power. The efficiency of quantum radar

394
00:25:03,224 --> 00:25:06,824
declines over long distances and achieving high power outputs while

395
00:25:06,864 --> 00:25:10,032
maintaining quantum properties, is technologically challenging.

396
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:14,368
This limits the practical development of quantum radar in extensive military

397
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:18,172
operations and applications. Its dependence on other quantum

398
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:22,260
sources, like high entangled photon generation sources and quantum memory

399
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:25,184
makes it less reliable in current scenario.

400
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:29,468
Quantum radar protocols, such as interferometric quantum radar,

401
00:25:29,516 --> 00:25:33,652
are highly sensitive to noise and require the preservation of quantum entanglement,

402
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:38,004
which is difficult in practical real world environments. Quantum decoherence,

403
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:41,692
where quantum states lows their coherence due to environmental interactions,

404
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,614
also remain of ethnic and health.

405
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:49,410
Next, we have quantum imaging. Quantum imaging uses

406
00:25:49,442 --> 00:25:53,330
quantum optic principles to enhance imaging capabilities beyond the limits of

407
00:25:53,362 --> 00:25:57,346
classical systems. So key components and techniques in quantum imaging

408
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,154
systems include sprite arrays, which are highly sensitive detectors that

409
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:05,010
measure time of flight of photons for 3d imaging. Quantum ghost

410
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:08,434
imaging, which uses entangled photons to create images from

411
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:11,734
correlations allowing for low light and non line

412
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:16,158
of sight imaging. Sub shot noise imaging, which utilizes correlated

413
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:19,966
photons to surpass classical noise limits and applicable detection of

414
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,154
weak absorption,

415
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:27,270
which employs entangled photon pairs for target detection in noisy

416
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:31,634
environments, maintaining advantages even when entanglement is decreasing.

417
00:26:32,294 --> 00:26:36,052
These advancements allow quantum imaging systems to perform tasks

418
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:40,092
such as behind the corner imaging, low light level detection, and high resolution

419
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:44,108
3d mapping. In the future, it could be used to store patterns of data

420
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:47,420
in quantum computers and allow communication through highly

421
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:50,804
encrypted information. Now we see that rural

422
00:26:50,844 --> 00:26:54,172
in military so quantum imaging allows for non line of sight

423
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:57,820
imaging, which is critical in urban and battlefield environments where

424
00:26:57,852 --> 00:27:01,700
direct line of sight is often obstructed. Spider is

425
00:27:01,732 --> 00:27:05,498
combined with advanced quantum protocols can detect objects hidden

426
00:27:05,546 --> 00:27:09,458
behind corners or walls, providing tactical advantages by revealing

427
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,882
enemy positions and movements that are otherwise concealed.

428
00:27:13,018 --> 00:27:16,690
Quantum imaging systems can operate effectively in low light and low

429
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:20,458
visibility predictions. Techniques like quantum ghost imaging utilize

430
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:24,314
entangled photons to produce high resolution images with minimal light,

431
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:28,210
allowing for surveillance missions to continue uninterrupted

432
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:32,004
during night operations or in other adverse weather conditions.

433
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:36,464
Quantum imaging offers a higher signal to noise ratio compared

434
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:40,312
to classical systems, making it possible to detect and image

435
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:44,312
objects with greater clarity and precision. This improved SNR

436
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:48,360
is crucial for applications such as monitoring the battlefield

437
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:53,096
environments, identifying threats, and guiding precision initiations.

438
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,770
It enables high resolution 3d imaging and mapping of

439
00:27:56,802 --> 00:28:00,162
terrains and structures. This capability is essential for creating

440
00:28:00,218 --> 00:28:03,578
accurate topographical maps, planning military operations,

441
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,954
and navigating complex environments. Now we see some

442
00:28:06,994 --> 00:28:10,690
challenges. The quantum emerging systems, such as those using sprite areas

443
00:28:10,762 --> 00:28:14,410
and entangled photons, involve sophisticated technology that is

444
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,930
complex to develop and maintain. The production and maintenance of

445
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:21,546
these advanced systems require substantial financial investment.

446
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:25,034
Also, these techniques are highly sensitive to environmental conditions.

447
00:28:25,114 --> 00:28:28,850
This can pose significant challenges for development in diverse and

448
00:28:28,882 --> 00:28:32,698
harsh military environments. The data generated by quantum imaging

449
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:36,386
systems are also vast and complex, so requiring

450
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,538
advanced algorithms and high performance computing resources for real

451
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,854
time processing and interpretation is also a challenge.

452
00:28:44,714 --> 00:28:48,268
Ensuring the security and reliability of quantum images systems

453
00:28:48,316 --> 00:28:52,108
is paramount for military use. Protecting these systems from

454
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:56,020
cyber threats, jamming, and other forms of electronic warfare is

455
00:28:56,052 --> 00:29:00,052
crucial. Additionally, the systems must be reliable and resilient,

456
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:03,852
able to perform consistently under the stress of combat conditions

457
00:29:03,948 --> 00:29:06,264
and potential adversarial actions.

458
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:11,116
So, in the next few years, prototyping and testing quantum sensors

459
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,794
in various environments will continue to take place.

460
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:17,406
This includes laboratory settings as well as field test in

461
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,030
more practical scenarios such as on drones and satellites.

462
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:25,022
Initial deployments of quantum sensing technologies for specific applications,

463
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:29,074
such as precision navigation and resource exploration, are anticipated.

464
00:29:29,454 --> 00:29:32,934
After that as technology matures, we can expect more quantum

465
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:36,550
sensing devices to enter the commercial market. This period will

466
00:29:36,582 --> 00:29:40,426
see increased integration of quantum sensors in industries like oil and

467
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,458
gas exploration, environmental monitoring and healthcare diagnostics.

468
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:48,794
Then we can expect more extensive use of quantum sensors in military applications,

469
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:52,818
particularly in US and China. Later on, quantum sensing

470
00:29:52,866 --> 00:29:57,258
technologies are expected to have widespread adoption across various sectors.

471
00:29:57,386 --> 00:30:00,826
It is also possible to have fully operational quantum radar systems

472
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,434
with long range capabilities and integration into space and naval

473
00:30:04,474 --> 00:30:06,614
based back homes with non capabilities.

474
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:12,298
Now we see some examples of quantum technologies that can be used for attacking

475
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:16,266
and that for defending. So for attacking. So first we have Shor's

476
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:20,170
algorithm. So Shor's algorithm threatens public key encryption methods

477
00:30:20,282 --> 00:30:23,770
like RSA, DH and ECC, potentially enabling decryption of

478
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:27,874
previously collected data. For example, ECC has shorter

479
00:30:27,914 --> 00:30:31,772
keys so attack will be easier as this will require lesser qubits.

480
00:30:31,938 --> 00:30:35,376
Then we have growers algorithms, so it provides speedup in searching

481
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,976
for the key which weakens symmetric key encryption but is currently

482
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,000
impractical due to quantum resource requirements. Simons algorithm

483
00:30:43,032 --> 00:30:46,216
and superposition queries pose risk to wage and AAD

484
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,816
algorithms, and then finally the trivial attacking methods.

485
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,440
Classical hacking and physical attacks on quantum equipments or

486
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:57,568
other equipments. Until new softwares are not quite properly secure,

487
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,866
hacking will always remain a threat. Also, the quantum networks

488
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,930
are subjected to physical attacks by external

489
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:06,134
damage and external attack.

490
00:31:09,154 --> 00:31:12,450
Now we see some defensive mechanisms. So although

491
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:16,458
with existence of vulnerabilities at hardware and software endpoints,

492
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:20,370
QKD still provides a secure method for encryption key exchange,

493
00:31:20,482 --> 00:31:24,442
which is verified by mathematical proof. So PQC implementation

494
00:31:24,498 --> 00:31:28,046
is also critical and should be prioritized to counter the risk of future

495
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:32,230
decryption by quantum computers. Next we have quantum crypto

496
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:35,758
agility. The current trend involves preparing existing

497
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:39,190
infrastructure for quantum crypto agility, waiting it for

498
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:43,230
the deployment of standardized PQC as soon as it becomes

499
00:31:43,262 --> 00:31:47,006
available. Then we have emerging quantum resilient algorithms in

500
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,606
progress, and developing and designing them is crucial to withstand

501
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,874
quantum computing.

502
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:57,858
Moving on, let's see some scenarios on how some quantum technologies

503
00:31:57,906 --> 00:32:01,682
can be utilized for space and underwater warfare. So let's see some

504
00:32:01,738 --> 00:32:05,426
space warfare first. So first we have satellite based QPE.

505
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,610
So instead of ground to ground, satellites can be used as trusted repeaters.

506
00:32:09,722 --> 00:32:13,298
This is because they facilitate secure long distance communication,

507
00:32:13,426 --> 00:32:17,954
although they face security challenges similar to terrestrial systems.

508
00:32:18,074 --> 00:32:21,754
Currently, advanced protocols like measurement device independent QKD

509
00:32:21,794 --> 00:32:25,402
are being explored to enhance security and mitigate potential cyberattacks

510
00:32:25,418 --> 00:32:28,826
on satellite control systems. Then quantum goes to

511
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:33,170
merging technology and satellites which provide superior surveillance capabilities,

512
00:32:33,362 --> 00:32:36,730
particularly under adverse weather conditions or during nighttime.

513
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:40,314
This technology allows for high resolution imaging even in cloudier,

514
00:32:40,354 --> 00:32:44,334
foggy environments, improving military and intelligence operations from space.

515
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:49,586
Next, we have quantum enhanced detectors like quantum radars or radars deployed

516
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,082
on satellites, which offer significantly improved protection and

517
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:57,250
tracking capabilities for other satellites, space one objects and space jabras.

518
00:32:57,402 --> 00:33:01,106
These quantum sensors provide detection sensitivity

519
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,770
compared to classical radars, particularly for objects smaller than

520
00:33:04,802 --> 00:33:08,242
ten centimeter. Then the weaponization of space,

521
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:11,874
which includes the development of satellites equipped with laser weapons

522
00:33:11,914 --> 00:33:14,668
and satellites capable of attacking other satellites.

523
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:18,856
Quantum technologies enhance these capabilities by improving target detection

524
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,964
and precision. If we have underwater

525
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:27,400
sensitive quantum magnetometers and gravimeters can detect

526
00:33:27,432 --> 00:33:31,200
and classify underwater hazards without active sonar

527
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:34,488
emissions, which helps to maintain the stealth of surveying

528
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:37,856
vessels. Then there are quantum enhanced sonars which offer

529
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,206
higher precision and sensitivity, allowing for better detection of

530
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:45,118
submarines undersea canyons without emitting detectable sonar

531
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:49,462
winners. Quantum inertial navigation systems provide precise navigation

532
00:33:49,518 --> 00:33:53,030
for submarines and other underwater vehicles without the need for

533
00:33:53,062 --> 00:33:56,934
external signals which can be disrupted or detected. So, large submarines

534
00:33:56,974 --> 00:34:00,702
can incorporate these systems including necessary cryogenic cooling.

535
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:04,374
Quantum magnetometers such as quits can detect submarines

536
00:34:04,414 --> 00:34:08,244
and underwater mines with significantly greater sensitivity and range combination.

537
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,728
Comparative classical magnetic and anomaly detectors squid

538
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:15,112
magnetometers have the potential to detect submarines from distance

539
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,896
up to 6 km for a surpassing in the current detection

540
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,264
range of a few hundred meters by classical detectors.

541
00:34:22,424 --> 00:34:25,384
These errors work with enhanced noise separation,

542
00:34:25,544 --> 00:34:28,484
making it difficult for submarines to avoid detection.

543
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:32,688
Additionally, unmanned underwater vehicles equipped with quantum

544
00:34:32,736 --> 00:34:36,103
magnetometers can be used for mine detection and utilization.

545
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:40,227
Then, similar to ND satellite anti submarine warfare capabilities

546
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:41,783
can be also adopted.

547
00:34:44,323 --> 00:34:46,819
Some other warfare capabilities also.

548
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:50,107
Quantum technologies significantly enhance positioning,

549
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:54,179
navigation and timing systems with quantum clocks, providing high time measurement

550
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:57,619
accuracy crucial for global navigation satellite systems.

551
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:01,283
Then, quantum sensing based on magnetometric gravimetry

552
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:04,658
and gravity gradiometry provides high precision data

553
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:07,898
for studying earth surface and underground structures.

554
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:11,746
These technologies can detect unit gravitational magnetic footprints

555
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:16,458
of natural and man made objects. Quantum technologies can also significantly

556
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:20,290
enhance classical electronic warfare systems. For example, the integration of

557
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:24,746
quantum computing in electronic warfare can optimize rf spectrum

558
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,450
analysis through quantum MLEi techniques. Then, other quantum

559
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:32,138
timing enhanced participants can improve other quantum various

560
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:35,522
electronic preference capabilities such as signal intelligence,

561
00:35:35,578 --> 00:35:39,602
counter DRFM, and counter radar jamming. So overall, quantum tech

562
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:43,490
still significantly enhance eye star intelligence surveillance

563
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:47,658
target acquisition reconnaissance capabilities, which is helpful in strategic,

564
00:35:47,706 --> 00:35:50,094
multiphase and multidisciplinary operations.

565
00:35:51,434 --> 00:35:55,586
Moving on to the next section, these are some top countries investing

566
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,864
in quantum technologies. This includes India, USA,

567
00:35:58,904 --> 00:36:01,724
Canada, China, Russia, Australia, Japan,

568
00:36:02,824 --> 00:36:06,544
Israel, Singapore, South Korea, UK, European Union,

569
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:10,016
and so on. There are two front runners in the

570
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,616
current global market, which are China and US. So both China

571
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,232
and the United States are heavily invested in quantum technologies,

572
00:36:17,328 --> 00:36:20,656
recognizing the potential to transform industries and enhance national

573
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,580
security. The first is the government structure. The US employs

574
00:36:24,612 --> 00:36:28,204
a three pillars model for quantum research, dividing the federal

575
00:36:28,284 --> 00:36:31,764
investment among civilian, defense, and intelligence sectors, while for

576
00:36:31,804 --> 00:36:35,164
China substantial support comes from the People's Liberation army

577
00:36:35,204 --> 00:36:38,780
and the big defense companies it recruits. China has

578
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:42,388
demonstrated satellite based QKD and this infrastructure could easily

579
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:46,588
be adapted for military use. While US army is currently working on

580
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:50,122
quantum television politician research while the US is integrating

581
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:53,194
quantum comprehensive into alliances such as NATO,

582
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:57,106
China is collaborating with Russia in various technological fields with potential

583
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,090
for closer cooperation in quantum technologies. The US has traditionally

584
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:04,994
led in quantum computing innovation. China has made significant strides

585
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:08,414
in, particularly in quantum communication and quantum sensing.

586
00:37:08,754 --> 00:37:12,546
Let's see the budget. The US had increased its investment

587
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:16,814
in one technology from $500 million in 2015

588
00:37:16,894 --> 00:37:20,726
to almost $2.1 billion in 2021.

589
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:25,382
However, China had no rise, with investments growing from $300 million

590
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:29,326
to an estimated $13 billion over the same period.

591
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,894
So this data clearly captures the magnitude of their commitment for this

592
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:36,670
cause. Apart from government r educational research

593
00:37:36,742 --> 00:37:40,314
parties, 3000 key players in global quantum warfare market

594
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:44,194
contributing in one way or the other. So as of 2022, the quantum

595
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:48,714
warfare market was valued at approximately $134.66 million.

596
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:52,650
So this valuation reflects the early stage of technology adoption and the

597
00:37:52,682 --> 00:37:56,762
ongoing research and development efforts in the field. The quantum Horford

598
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,482
market is expected to grow significantly over the next decade.

599
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:04,466
It is predicted to reach $540.91 million by the

600
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,936
year 2030, with a compound annual growth

601
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,960
rate of 16.8% during the forecast period from 2023

602
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:15,312
to 2031. This growth is driven by the increasing

603
00:38:15,408 --> 00:38:18,640
investment in quantum technologies by defense organizations and

604
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:22,136
governance worldwide, as well as the potential disruptive capabilities

605
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,616
these technologies offer. In order to offer now,

606
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,304
we see green challenges. First, we have technical challenges.

607
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:36,190
In most of these we have already seen in the previous sections, so it will

608
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:39,838
always be a challenge to make the product actually deployable. So after

609
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:43,754
this, the developed prototype should be integrated with existing military

610
00:38:44,214 --> 00:38:47,614
infrastructures such as communication networks, gps systems, etc.

611
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:51,718
To ensure seamless interoperability. This involves complex engineering

612
00:38:51,766 --> 00:38:55,230
to ensure proper functioning of the quantum devices without any operational

613
00:38:55,302 --> 00:38:59,142
disruptions. Apart from this, they must undergo rigorous decision and

614
00:38:59,158 --> 00:39:02,814
validation to ensure they meet the standards required in military applications.

615
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:06,126
Another crucial challenge is related to the data handling part.

616
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:10,054
It's important to have efficient data handling protocols and systems that can

617
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:14,014
manage the high data throughput without compromising speech or security.

618
00:39:14,174 --> 00:39:17,542
So these are some of the major challenges from the technical viewpoint as

619
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:20,838
we are talking about war. To determine the external nature of the war,

620
00:39:20,886 --> 00:39:24,654
policies are the foremost thing. Each new technology in war comes

621
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:28,954
with its own level of effect. So with the quantum technology, also new policies

622
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:32,946
are needed. The first one is to obviously answer the ethical

623
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,954
questions. So these technologies may also challenge existing legal frameworks,

624
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:40,434
particularly concerning the laws of war and international treaties.

625
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:44,210
Also, this can alter the global security landscape, potentially leading

626
00:39:44,242 --> 00:39:47,554
to new arms races or shifts in power dynamics. Hence,

627
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:51,038
policymakers must navigate these ethical and legal boundaries

628
00:39:51,106 --> 00:39:55,174
to establish guidelines in compliance with international laws that

629
00:39:55,214 --> 00:39:58,394
balance technological advancements with moral responsibility.

630
00:39:58,694 --> 00:40:01,926
The next challenge is related to the standardization procedures,

631
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,582
so ensuring interoperability between quantum technologies from different

632
00:40:05,638 --> 00:40:08,910
manufacturers and nations is essential for collaborative military

633
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:12,734
operations. Also, establishing reliable verification protocols

634
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:15,894
to authenticate the performance and security of quantum

635
00:40:16,054 --> 00:40:19,528
technologies is crucial. And these protocols must be rigorous

636
00:40:19,576 --> 00:40:23,640
enough to detect any anomalies or weaknesses, ensuring that the technologies meet

637
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:27,792
the required standards for military use. So achieving overall unification

638
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:31,216
in the standards and practices for quantum technologies across the

639
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,096
military sector is essential for its effective implementation.

640
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,000
Now, we have related to the manpower, the complexity,

641
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:42,632
chefs quantum technologies necessitates a specialized training program,

642
00:40:42,688 --> 00:40:46,520
so military personnel, so developing comprehensive training modules

643
00:40:46,552 --> 00:40:49,920
that govern both theoretical knowledge and practical skills is

644
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:53,952
essential to ensure that operators and technicians can effectively utilize and

645
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:57,104
maintain these advanced systems. And for this,

646
00:40:57,184 --> 00:41:01,040
establishing dedicated courses and research programs is crucial for

647
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:04,648
building a skilled workforce. This also requires interdisciplinary

648
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:08,352
expertise as quantum technologies intersect with multiple fields,

649
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:11,730
including physics, engineering, cybersecurity,

650
00:41:11,842 --> 00:41:15,522
etcetera. So collaborative programs need to be designed to foster

651
00:41:15,578 --> 00:41:19,474
interdisciplinary expertise. Moving on this economical challenges

652
00:41:19,514 --> 00:41:23,314
for the governing bodies, private organizations, and other stakeholders

653
00:41:23,434 --> 00:41:27,114
directly or indirectly associated with this technology. So these players,

654
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:31,282
along with military organizations, must assess the long term financial impact,

655
00:41:31,418 --> 00:41:35,170
balancing the cost with the anticipated benefit, and sustainable funding

656
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:39,202
for research and development. This calls for an efficient allocation of resources

657
00:41:39,258 --> 00:41:42,930
to avoid redundancy and ensure that critical areas receive the

658
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:47,146
necessary support. Strategic planning and prioritization are

659
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,294
required to maximize the impact of investment in military applications.

660
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:56,578
Concluding the talk here are the key takeaways for

661
00:41:56,626 --> 00:42:00,298
advancements in quantum website technology signify transformative shift

662
00:42:00,346 --> 00:42:03,794
in military capabilities currently, many quantum technologies are still

663
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:07,472
in the experimental development stages, since we have seen

664
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:11,104
some technologists like QPT have already demonstrated their excellence

665
00:42:11,144 --> 00:42:14,992
over classical methods. While other areas like quantum sensing are fast

666
00:42:15,048 --> 00:42:17,944
growing and looks promising in some aspects.

667
00:42:18,064 --> 00:42:22,096
So there are still some unanswered questions on whether certain quantum technologies like

668
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,304
quantum ratar will meet the practical requirements or not.

669
00:42:25,424 --> 00:42:28,592
But overall, the next few decades will be critical for advancing

670
00:42:28,648 --> 00:42:32,132
these technologies, from theoretical concepts and rebels laboratory

671
00:42:32,188 --> 00:42:35,304
demonstrations to practical field developer systems.

672
00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:40,324
Here are some references. And so that

673
00:42:40,364 --> 00:42:42,836
brings us to the end. So if you want to reach out to me,
