1
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,038
Monitoring observability. It's obviously incredibly crucial

2
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:34,222
whether you're on prem cloud kubernetes,

3
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:37,846
standard containers, wherever you're running, you need to

4
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,598
understand what's happening in your environment, whether it's monitoring.

5
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:45,094
So graphs, alerting, seeing everything on a screen,

6
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,634
understanding what's happening from that perspective, or observability,

7
00:00:48,934 --> 00:00:52,754
which is more around the idea of taking action.

8
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:56,758
My name is Michael Levan. Welcome to my session at Conf

9
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,046
42. We're going to dive into a bunch of hands on stuff,

10
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,838
but primarily I'm going to show two different realms of focus.

11
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:08,190
The homegrown or open source style solutions and

12
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:11,790
the enterprise solutions. We're going to walk through installing both.

13
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:15,046
We're going to do data dog on Q Prometheus and we're going to talk about

14
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,870
the differences, which should hopefully help you decide which one you're going to go within

15
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:22,046
your organization. Let's go ahead and jump right in. Let's start by

16
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,254
diving into cube Prometheus. Alright, so I'm going

17
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:29,598
to open up my terminal, do a quick cube Ctl, get nodes here

18
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:33,382
we can see I am on an EKS cluster.

19
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:37,094
It's not going to matter though, if you're on aks GkE on

20
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:40,254
prem, all these steps should be relatively similar.

21
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,374
Okay, so the first thing that you're going to do, you're going to want to

22
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:47,238
add the helm chart for Q Prometheus. I essentially do everything

23
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:51,022
via helm chart. Why? It's a great package

24
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,654
manager. It's much better than just going and calling out to a bunch of kubernetes

25
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:58,198
manifests. And instead of again using 567 different

26
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:01,886
kubernetes manifests, everything is under one roof. So I typically

27
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,270
go with helm charts. Next, going to go ahead and update

28
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:08,590
the repo. Once that's done, we will install

29
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:12,494
Cube Prometheus. Okay, now as the name

30
00:02:12,534 --> 00:02:16,022
sounds, Cube Prometheus is going to be a combination

31
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:18,674
of Prometheus and grafana.

32
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:22,836
Can you install these separate? Absolutely. But the reason why I

33
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,676
actually like to do it together is because Kube Prometheus gives

34
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,308
you a bunch of dashboards out of the box that are all kubernetes

35
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:34,332
related. So let's say I just install Grafana and Prometheus separately.

36
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:38,244
I'm not going to have any dashboards, but if I install Kube Prometheus,

37
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:41,884
it comes again pre installed with all these different Kubernetes dashboards,

38
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:46,156
which we'll go ahead and take a look at in a second. And once

39
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,556
this is installed, it takes of course a little bit because there's

40
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,490
a bunch of different pods that need to come up. You can forward and look

41
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:57,146
at Prometheus via port forwarding, or you can just go ahead

42
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,834
and hit Grafana, right? So let's go ahead and do

43
00:03:00,874 --> 00:03:02,934
this. That way we can get a nice visual,

44
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:07,426
right? And then let me go ahead and open up a web browser.

45
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,454
Web browser is up. We can see that here.

46
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:15,258
I'm going to go ahead and just take a look here. To log

47
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:18,934
in, the default username is admin, password is prom operator.

48
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:23,794
So admin from hyphen operator.

49
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:28,142
And now we're logged in. So what I was referring to

50
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:30,834
before, if I go to dashboards,

51
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:35,326
notice here how I have all these different Kubernetes dashboards.

52
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,646
You will not have this by default. And of

53
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,958
course if you want to, you can import a new one. So for example,

54
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:45,786
if we just take a look here,

55
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,218
we have the argo cd dashboard, for example. So what I can do is I

56
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:53,018
can actually copy the iD, go back

57
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:56,554
new, import, paste that

58
00:03:56,594 --> 00:04:00,370
id in load, you can see it is in fact argo

59
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:03,770
cd import, and then boom, we have the dashboard. So it's pretty

60
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:07,370
straightforward. You can also write your own dashboards. I believe they're still written in

61
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:10,970
Python, at least they used to be, but nonetheless you can create your own.

62
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:14,418
But there are a lot out there already, so don't reinvent the wheel if you

63
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:17,662
don't have to. But if I go back to dashboards here and let's

64
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:21,246
say I click on Kubernetes API server. Now, I haven't made

65
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,670
any requests or anything to this, so it's probably not the best,

66
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:28,422
but we can see here again, another dashboard, compute resources,

67
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:32,158
some cpu information, some memory information, etcetera. But point

68
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:35,670
being is we can see the dashboards work and then if we

69
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:39,606
want to, we can get alerting on various dashboards and all that

70
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,654
fun stuff. So this is the monitoring piece,

71
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:46,134
and if you want the full observability stack for logs,

72
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:49,782
traces, metrics, you're gonna have to do prometheus, which is already here,

73
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,854
and then tempo and low key for traces and

74
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,470
logging, and then you'll have the full monitoring and observability stack.

75
00:04:57,582 --> 00:05:00,790
But there are a couple things here, and it's not necessarily a

76
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:03,878
bad thing, it's just you got to kind of figure out what

77
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:07,110
option you want. So this is the homegrown solution. This is open source.

78
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:10,578
I'm not paying for anything, okay? But I actually am,

79
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,530
right? I'm paying for engineers to manage it, I'm paying for infrastructure,

80
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:18,282
because this has to run somewhere, so there are still costs. And again,

81
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:22,546
this isn't a bad thing. It's just all going to be dependent on your organization.

82
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,146
If you're a startup, for example, and everybody's already working

83
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,410
13 hours a day, adding another tool

84
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:33,682
may not be the best method. Or maybe it is, again, depending on

85
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:37,374
how the organization is structured. So let's say you

86
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:41,470
want all these tools, monitoring and observability and even APM

87
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:45,382
and alerting and a bunch of other stuff under one roof. Maybe it's

88
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:49,406
a SaaS so you don't have to manage the infrastructure or anything like that.

89
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,822
Probably want to look at a enterprise paid solution.

90
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:55,998
Okay. And that's kind of what we can get with Datadog.

91
00:05:56,086 --> 00:06:00,014
Now, with Datadog, again, we get everything under one

92
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:04,000
roof, metrics, logs, full monitors,

93
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:08,544
service management, infrastructure management, APM, all of it.

94
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:12,624
All we have to do for this is if I go under my

95
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:16,600
and I click on API keys, right? I'm going to have an

96
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:20,056
API key here. I'll go ahead and I'll just

97
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,364
create a new one. We'll just call it con 42

98
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,414
create key, right? And then now I have this API key.

99
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:32,098
So if I copy it, I'm going to head back over to versus code.

100
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:36,494
Okay. And I'm just open up a new terminal here

101
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:42,386
and I'm going to paste in that API key, my cluster name,

102
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,534
ks. Quick start. Okay,

103
00:06:45,954 --> 00:06:47,882
first thing you're going to want to do, going to want to sign up for

104
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:50,754
Datadog. It's free to sign up. You're not going to be paying for anything.

105
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:54,256
I've been doing demos on Datadog for a long time now and

106
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,636
haven't got a bill because I just delete my stuff right away. Okay.

107
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,944
But I'm going to set these environment variables.

108
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:06,556
I'm going to use helm. Okay. So if you don't have the data dog helm

109
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,492
chart, you're going to want to add it and update it. And then I'm going

110
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:13,148
to use this fairly large helm installation.

111
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:16,396
And the reason why is because this sets us up for high

112
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,672
availability. So we're going to see, you know, multiple replicas,

113
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:22,824
cube state metrics is enabled, we're enabling logging,

114
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:25,844
we're enabling all the logs for the containers.

115
00:07:26,744 --> 00:07:30,216
So let's go ahead and run this and

116
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,564
it may take maybe two to three minutes to actually see

117
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:36,964
all the information within your environment.

118
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:42,256
Right? So if I head back over here, I click finish,

119
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,456
I'm going to go to dashboard. Oops,

120
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,194
sorry, infrastructure and kubernetes explorer.

121
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:54,374
Okay. And we can actually see all this stuff in here right

122
00:07:54,414 --> 00:07:58,062
away, but I want to click on one other.

123
00:07:58,118 --> 00:08:02,534
Let's see kubernetes overview. Okay, here it is. So if

124
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:05,662
I check here, I can see my cluster, I can see

125
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:09,606
all my namespaces. See the monitoring namespace, right. Because we deployed

126
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,286
Q Prometheus. And then if I click on explore,

127
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,312
I can see everything running here. So if I

128
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:21,184
look into one of these pods, maybe, you know, one of the Q Prometheus

129
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:24,888
pods, we can see the cluster, it's on the service

130
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:29,088
that it's in. Well in back of the monitoring namespace,

131
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:32,920
the host, the deployment, replica sets, ips, everything. We can see

132
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:36,576
everything here, even the metadata. Okay. We can see

133
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,408
any related resources which this is actually really cool. It's a little

134
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:43,916
graph here that we can see. Right. Troubleshooter.

135
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,236
I don't think we have anything on. Status is ready. Alright, so we're

136
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,852
good to go here. So we have the pod phase,

137
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:54,172
which is actually nice. We get a little bit of different information

138
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,544
here, logs, if we turn them on.

139
00:08:57,164 --> 00:09:00,252
So any logs that are coming in through the pod,

140
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:04,148
okay, metrics, etcetera. So point

141
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:08,308
being is this, we have everything under one

142
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:11,860
roof. Of course if we install it, we have to install different things for trace

143
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:15,932
and stuff. But everything is under one roof.

144
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,300
Okay. So we can dive down. We also have a visual of

145
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:23,036
this, right? So we dive down, we see our clusters

146
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,028
running, we see our namespaces, see all of our workloads.

147
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:29,504
Okay. We see our networking.

148
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:33,484
And this is really solid. Now, Datadog is expensive,

149
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:37,004
don't get me wrong. But again, this is a good

150
00:09:37,124 --> 00:09:40,184
implementation. If you want that enterprise,

151
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:43,662
I don't even want to say enterprise grade feel because you can get the same

152
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:47,950
feel from Grafana and the Prometheus stack.

153
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:51,662
But if you want that SaaS based solution that's set up for you,

154
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:55,022
you just have to run a couple of installations or even just one.

155
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:59,006
You got support behind you all that. Data dog is

156
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,518
a great implementation. Again, just keep in mind,

157
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:05,942
you know, never think that you're not paying because I

158
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,302
know a lot of people go open source because they don't want to pay.

159
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:11,916
Either way you're paying. You're either paying engineers to manage it

160
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,276
and the infrastructure to run it on, or you're paying a SaaS solution.

161
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,068
It's really going to be up to you at the end of the day.

162
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:22,476
Thank you so much for joining me for the session. Really do appreciate it.

163
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,324
Hope that you enjoyed it.
