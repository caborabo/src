1
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,214
My name is Artem. I'm a software engineer with experience more

2
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:31,670
than ten years. Currently I'm working at Microsoft and today

3
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,778
I would like to give you a short overview of serverless programming,

4
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:39,318
the most popular platforms in this area, and some

5
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:43,170
challenges you can face during developing your application with serverless

6
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,090
programming. So what is the cloud computing?

7
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,054
Cloud computing refers to the library of computer services

8
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:55,210
over the Internet, enabling user to access resources and applications

9
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,374
on demand without the need for local infrastructure or

10
00:00:59,412 --> 00:01:02,346
hardware. In cloud computing, data,

11
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:06,190
applications and resources are hosted on remote servers

12
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,146
maintained by cloud services providers, allowing users to

13
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:13,614
access them from anywhere with an Internet

14
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:18,310
connection. Azure cloud computing platforms are

15
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,502
Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud

16
00:01:22,556 --> 00:01:25,670
platform. Let's talk about

17
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,498
each one. So, first in the list,

18
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:33,034
Amazon Web Services is the most comprehensive and

19
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:35,866
widely used cloud platform in the world,

20
00:01:36,048 --> 00:01:39,210
with customers in over 190 countries.

21
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,514
OS, which works with over 5000 educational

22
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,586
institutions and 2000 government organizations,

23
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:51,040
accounts for more than half of the global public. Cloud share

24
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,042
OS offers more than 200 cloud services and

25
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:58,014
products in industries such as computing, storage,

26
00:01:58,062 --> 00:02:02,462
databases, analytics, networking, mobile developer tools,

27
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:07,362
management tools, Internet of Things, security and enterprise

28
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:11,206
applications. Below, we'll describe the most popular of

29
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:14,614
them. So here are the top five for

30
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:18,234
Amazon. EC Two is a

31
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:22,778
compute cloud web service which allows users to rent virtual serverless

32
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:26,666
instances and run various application and workloads on

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,522
them. RDS this is a cloud service to create

34
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:33,850
various database instances like relational

35
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,480
databases, nonrelational databases and many of others.

36
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,234
S free is a scalable cloud storage

37
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:45,906
service which is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data

38
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:49,662
from anywhere over the web, offering highly durable

39
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:53,298
and available object storage infrastructure. It's really, really a

40
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:56,434
reliable one. Amazon Lambda

41
00:02:56,562 --> 00:03:00,402
Service is a service to support serverless computing.

42
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:04,310
We will talk more about these kind of services a bit later after

43
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,902
overview of the most popular

44
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:11,546
cloud computing services. Cloud Front

45
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:15,210
this is a content delivery network which is, in a simple

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,906
words, improved website performance by providing access to cloud

47
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:22,240
based data in more efficient way.

48
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,682
Let's go to the next one. Next one is the Microsoft Azure.

49
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:30,862
It's a cloud computing platform developed and operated by

50
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,610
Microsoft. Includes over 200 products, same as

51
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,890
Amazon and cloud services designed to easily build,

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,406
run and manage applications across multiple clouds.

53
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:45,074
Using a variety of tools and frameworks. From DevOps to

54
00:03:45,112 --> 00:03:48,990
business analytics to the Internet of Things, Azure offers scalable,

55
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,726
cost effective solutions that bring together everything you need,

56
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:56,210
related products, services, third party applications,

57
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,878
modern nowadays, open eye resources which you can use to leverage

58
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:04,170
power of large language models in your applications.

59
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,982
So let's move on to the top five Microsoft Azure

60
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:13,022
services first and

61
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:16,654
similar to Amazon Service,

62
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:20,954
Azure VMS and web applications support. You need to handle

63
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:23,774
different computing tasks, web applications,

64
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:27,410
different workloads. You just create instances there

65
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,406
and run your code. Next one is Azure Blob

66
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,350
searches which supports your needs to store any portions of data

67
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,982
for your applications. Very useful in data lakes and things

68
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:43,222
like this. Next one Azure Kubernetes serverless,

69
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:47,438
would offer you managed Kubernetes environment to support your continuous

70
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:51,046
delivery work with your cluster and to ease

71
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:54,650
your day to day life. Azure functions

72
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,646
similar with AWS Lambda serverless computing

73
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:01,802
service and next one azure

74
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,906
active directory or azure identity.

75
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:08,782
This is a service to support many features based on

76
00:05:08,836 --> 00:05:13,406
access control such as user siding, authorization authentication

77
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:17,220
and control over access from one application to another.

78
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,666
Let's move on to the third one in this list.

79
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:25,974
Google Cloud platform is a cloud computing platform

80
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,138
used by Google to power all of the tech giants,

81
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:32,760
services and products including Gmail and Google Search,

82
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,458
on the other hand, offers over 100 products and services

83
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:41,466
under the GSP brand to millions of customers

84
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:45,450
worldwide. The lineup includes a wide change of

85
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,918
cloud services such as computing storage,

86
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:51,070
machine learning and data analytics.

87
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,826
Here we have top five for Google Cloud platform compute

88
00:05:56,858 --> 00:06:00,154
engine. This is a Google analog for cloud computing

89
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:03,140
similar to Amazon EC two or Azure Web services.

90
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,222
Cloud storage allows highly durable

91
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,450
and available storage infrastructure.

92
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,954
Bigquery is a fully managed, serverless and highly

93
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:19,734
scalable data warehouse and analytics platform provided by Google Cloud platform.

94
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:23,666
It enables users to analyze large data sets using SQLite

95
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:27,678
queries quickly and cost efficiently without needing

96
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:30,890
to manage infrastructure or worry about scalability.

97
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,802
Google Kubernetes Cluster Kubernetes engine

98
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:40,242
same as Azure Kubernetes services support your Kubernetes

99
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:44,046
with environment infrastructure to

100
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:48,062
help you process your continuous deployment and other

101
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,566
stuff. Google Cloud platforms, AI and

102
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:55,378
machine learning includes tools for automated model training and

103
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:58,290
AI platform for simple model deployments.

104
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,862
Let's now talk about serverless computing.

105
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,834
Serverless computing is a method of obtaining on demand backend

106
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:10,422
services. In other words, we only pay

107
00:07:10,476 --> 00:07:14,502
for actual code execution for actual function calls instead

108
00:07:14,556 --> 00:07:18,890
of paying for maintaining service or infrastructures.

109
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,606
As we told before, Amazon, Microsoft and Google provide serverless

110
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:27,690
computing at their cloud computing

111
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,094
platforms such as OS Lambda, azure functions, and Google Cloud

112
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:35,882
services. Here are some benefits which we can gain

113
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:39,246
from serverless computing. First in the

114
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:43,054
list is scalability, the ability of application to automatically

115
00:07:43,102 --> 00:07:45,570
adapt to changing workloads.

116
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,702
It means that cloudless serverless

117
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:54,210
computing allows us to smoothly

118
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,266
go through traffic spikes to increase

119
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,170
capacity of our resources

120
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,790
on the demand. Next one is

121
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,602
cost effectiveness because users are built based on

122
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,722
actual usage. Serverless computing can save

123
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:17,434
a significant amount of money when we have low traffic or we

124
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:21,034
don't have traffic at all. We just don't pay if we don't

125
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:24,446
use and the last one in the list

126
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:28,526
performance serverless Pro platforms provide tools and services for

127
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:32,270
monitoring and optimizing applications performance at scale.

128
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,246
Let's talk about some real use cases of cloud computing and serverless

129
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:41,602
computing. First example, Amazon, which leverage benefits of

130
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:45,082
serverless computing to handle spike traffic

131
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,870
during different events like Black Fridays or

132
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,774
other promotions, so scalable design helps to

133
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:55,720
provide smooth shopping experience for Milan of customers.

134
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,762
Amazon relies on cloud computing to effectively manage its

135
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:04,762
massive online retail operations using the benefits of its

136
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:08,938
cloud platform. The leading cloud platform, the online retail agent,

137
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:12,418
gains scalable infrastructure capable to handle traffic spikes.

138
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:16,206
As I said before, it relies on

139
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:19,806
such technologies like EC Two for web hosting, Amazon s

140
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:23,842
three for storage, which I also mentioned. It's really

141
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,860
reliable solution and also they use

142
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,046
lambda functions to serverless functions let's

143
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:35,002
go to the next one. Next one is healthcare.

144
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,374
Kaiser Permanent, one of the

145
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:42,002
largest healthcare providers in the United States, has been actively

146
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:45,398
incorporating Microsoft Azure's cloud computing services

147
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:49,686
into its operation to improve patient care and efficiency.

148
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:53,142
Care teams in particular use Microsoft Azure

149
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:56,678
solutions to collect and analyze data from medical devices

150
00:09:56,774 --> 00:10:01,450
in order to ensure data driven decision making and personalized

151
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,402
patient care. Azure also powers telemedicine

152
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:08,974
services, allowing patients to access healthcare services from

153
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:12,174
anywhere. With Azure's comprehensive set of

154
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,870
cloudbased services, Kaiser Permanent is now capable of providing

155
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,586
timely and personalized digital experience to

156
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:23,410
its massive patient base of more than 12 million

157
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,966
patients, as well as equivalents medical personnel to

158
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:30,614
make more informed decisions and a little

159
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:34,130
bit different area from previous two gaming.

160
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,634
Supercell, the developer of maybe popular mobile

161
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:41,066
games such as Clash of clans, relies on cloud solutions to

162
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:44,678
handle traffic spikes during the game launch and updates.

163
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:48,806
Supercell requires thousands of servers on a continuous basis

164
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:52,874
because each player starting a game necessates

165
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:56,974
a session on the server side and the number of servers must

166
00:10:57,012 --> 00:11:00,302
grow concurrently as more players join in.

167
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:03,794
So Supercell's entire game infrastructure is built on

168
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:08,014
Amazon Web Services, the same as Amazon.

169
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:12,078
It use EC two instances distributed across multiple availability

170
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:14,050
zones to increase availability,

171
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,862
storing up to ten terabytes of game event data per day.

172
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:23,858
With the ability to scale server capacity based on player demand,

173
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:27,426
they can efficiently handle traffic spikes while minimizing cost

174
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:32,086
during quieter periods. So let's

175
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:35,338
now talk about what challenges we can met

176
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:39,706
with cloud computing, and first in

177
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:43,034
the list would be the protection

178
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:47,322
of personal and sensitive data such as personal information financial

179
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:50,686
information or health records is critical in

180
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,770
cloud computing. In a serverless architecture where

181
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,910
the servers are managed by the cloud service provider,

182
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,878
protecting this kind of data becomes a difficult task.

183
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:07,426
Compliance with the regulations such as health insurance portability

184
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:11,142
and accountability acts, or GDPR general

185
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:15,240
data protection regulation is required to fulfill it.

186
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,798
Following the security guidelines provided by cloud service providers,

187
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:24,134
conducting regular security audits, and implementing

188
00:12:24,262 --> 00:12:27,290
strong identity and access management,

189
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,830
we can mitigate this risk.

190
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,694
Amazon, Azure and Google Cloud, each of them offer

191
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:40,010
different security guidelines, tools to monitor

192
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,340
your applications to assist in the security of cloud based application.

193
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,574
Regular assessment of cloud infrastructure to identity

194
00:12:48,622 --> 00:12:51,934
and correct potential security vulnerabilities aid

195
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:55,418
in the maintenance of a strong security posture.

196
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:59,810
Username identity

197
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,034
access management controls framework to ensure that only authorized

198
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:07,826
and authenticated users have access to specific data or

199
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:12,042
applications. Next one is

200
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:15,500
vendor lock in. What is the vendor lock in?

201
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,754
Vendor lock in occurs when a user loses ability to

202
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:23,354
switch to a different vendor. So for example, we lose

203
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,862
ability to switch from Amazon to Azure or to Google

204
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,302
Cloud platform. It may

205
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:33,780
occur by different courses by using

206
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,194
vendor specific logic and things like

207
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:42,418
this. So how we can

208
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:46,360
work with this one, so we can work with

209
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,562
implementing cloud agnostic technologies like contrization

210
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:54,454
or microservices architecture. These strategies make it

211
00:13:54,492 --> 00:13:57,490
easier to switch cloud providers if necessary,

212
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,722
reducing the impact or vendor lock in so

213
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:04,890
we can save ourselves from these risks.

214
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,580
And the next one in the list cost

215
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,694
management. So it's really important to understand how

216
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:17,182
much we pay for our services for our infrastructure we keep

217
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:20,506
in cloud provider and analyzing

218
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:23,826
serverless cost is essential for cost management and tools such

219
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:27,134
as AWS, cost explorer or Azure.

220
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:30,498
Cost management help organization track and understand

221
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:34,414
their serverless spending, their budgets

222
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:38,062
on the infrastructure. To optimize serverless cost,

223
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:41,414
organization can implement resource cleanup practices, set up

224
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:44,898
budget alerts to monitor spending, and regularly

225
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:48,526
review usage patterns to precise

226
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:51,654
resources and reduce unnecessary expenses.

227
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:55,194
Cost optimization is crucial for maintaining a cost

228
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:58,426
effective serverless environment. So let's talk

229
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:01,878
about trends we have in this area right now, where we'll

230
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:05,050
be developed in the next decade.

231
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,954
So one of the trends we can see, it's edge computing

232
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:13,054
and the Internet of Things. Edge computing is gaining popularity

233
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:16,526
because it brings computation closer to the data source.

234
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:20,814
Reducing latency and enable real time processing

235
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:24,926
is critical for Internet of Things devices, autonomous vehicles

236
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,686
and remote monitoring. Serverless computing is being extended

237
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:32,418
to edge devices, allowing organization to run lightweight serverless

238
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:36,294
functions directly on edge devices, enhancing their

239
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:39,530
ability to process and respond to data locally.

240
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,094
One of the most significant on my opinion trend,

241
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:48,678
it's machine learning and artificial intelligence machine

242
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:53,546
learning and AI are increasingly being integrated with cloud and serverless platforms.

243
00:15:53,738 --> 00:15:56,942
Microsoft Azure provide you open

244
00:15:56,996 --> 00:16:00,382
eye resources which you can use to get an access

245
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:04,466
to GPT, four Dalia different models which

246
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:08,180
you can use and leverage the power of it in your application.

247
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,878
Other cloud providers as well provides specialized

248
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:16,614
services and frameworks that enable organization to efficiently build

249
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:20,760
and scale AI solutions. AI and machine learning are

250
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,282
being used in a variety of fields, from healthcare

251
00:16:25,346 --> 00:16:28,982
diagnostics to self driving cars. Natural language

252
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:32,698
processing and computer vision are two examples of AI driven services

253
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,534
that are transforming industries and spam. New applications

254
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:40,522
right now and the next trend hybrid

255
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:43,914
and multicloud solutions hybrid

256
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:47,774
cloud environments, which combine on premises infrastructure with

257
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:51,680
public and private cloud resources, are becoming more common.

258
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,506
They are adaptable, allowing data and workloads to

259
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:59,742
move seamlessly between environments. Multicloud strategies

260
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:02,974
employ multiple cloud providers for various purposes,

261
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,678
providing redundancy and flexibility. In other words,

262
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:10,022
you use the best each cloud provider can

263
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:13,746
offer you. Multicloud deployments are expected

264
00:17:13,778 --> 00:17:16,934
to play a significant role in the future of

265
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:20,714
cloud computing as organizations seek to avoid vendor locking and

266
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,554
optimized performance. So that

267
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:28,214
was my overview of the current cloud computing

268
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:31,774
services of the serverless products

269
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:35,214
they have, and the conclusion here

270
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:38,762
that the rise of cloud computing is reshaping the digital

271
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:42,640
world. I think it's also reshaped right now,

272
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,526
creating new opportunities for scalable and cost effective

273
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:50,146
deployment cycles, allowing organizations to

274
00:17:50,248 --> 00:17:54,002
scale easily while focusing on

275
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:57,738
code rather than infrastructure management measure.

276
00:17:57,854 --> 00:18:01,190
Multinational corporations such as

277
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,350
iOS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud platform provide

278
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,634
hundreds of cloud services and products that transform virtually

279
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:13,190
every industry from e commerce to healthcare and gaming.

280
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,718
Despite some potential security concerns and serverless architectures,

281
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:20,960
these technologies have a promising future.

282
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,074
Cloud computing is rapidly evolving with new technologies

283
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:28,750
and services operating on a regular basis.

284
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,720
It involves new products like,

285
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,006
as we told before, tools for machine learning,

286
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:41,278
for artificial intelligence, who are using power

287
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:45,398
of the natural language models and

288
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:48,550
all other modern stuff. Yeah,

289
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,040
thank you for the listening me today. Thank you for your time.

290
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,940
Hope you enjoy the conference. Have a great day.
