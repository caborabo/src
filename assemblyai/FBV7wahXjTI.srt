1
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,370
Everyone, I am thrilled to be here today to explore

2
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,294
the captivating world of leadership 20. And this

3
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,634
one's from a very unique vantage point, a lens of a senior

4
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:39,862
product manager buckle up as we navigate the intricacies of

5
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,074
product development and team leadership in this ever evolving

6
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:47,206
tech landscape. So, a quick introduction. About me my

7
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:50,986
name is Tanvi Mishra and I work as a senior product manager at Amazon.

8
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:54,462
I've been working with Amazon for over almost seven years and

9
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:57,914
I have worked on a range of different products from Amazon launches

10
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:02,110
in Netherlands, Sweden and Poland, and now working with Amazon trade.

11
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,770
So what does exactly a product

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,540
manager do? Or how do they drive success?

13
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,046
I think it's a combination of couple of key responsibilities,

14
00:01:14,238 --> 00:01:17,586
number one being strategy. Product managers

15
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:21,318
are the architects of strategic initiatives. They steer the product

16
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:25,058
towards alignment with business goals. They specialize

17
00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:29,094
in the ability to envision the future landscape,

18
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:33,238
understand what the customer needs, and formulate winning strategies.

19
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:36,730
The second one is vision. The product

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,506
leader acts as the torch bearer of the product's long term

21
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:44,026
vision. This entails not only foreseeing industry

22
00:01:44,058 --> 00:01:47,834
trends, but also inspiring teams to innovate and constantly

23
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:50,894
create products that stand the test of time.

24
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:54,814
Roadmap planning is the third one. Crafting a roadmap

25
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:58,286
is the key to chartering a course through uncharted waters.

26
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:01,854
Product managers create a strategic plan or roadmap

27
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:05,134
for the development of evolution of products over time.

28
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:08,882
This roadmap outlines enhancements,

29
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:12,326
milestones, and that all of these steps are

30
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:16,182
being done by the product team to aim and achieve the key

31
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:20,074
metrics of any product development. Stakeholder management is

32
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:23,706
the fourth and the key important part of actually delivering any kind

33
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:27,642
of product. Successful product leaders recognize that any

34
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:31,866
product success is a result of actually successful partnerships

35
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:35,002
with diverse stakeholders. Effective communication,

36
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:39,354
collaboration and negotiation skills are vital to navigate

37
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:41,710
this intricate web of relationships.

38
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,874
So what does a product development looks

39
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:49,310
like? In my view, there are essentially

40
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,198
seven phases, the first one being idea generation.

41
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:57,154
At this stage, creative collaboration and identification of

42
00:02:57,192 --> 00:03:00,566
potential concepts are looked at. What can be an

43
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:03,814
ideal solution? What does the customer want? What can we look

44
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:07,222
at? And everyone comes together to identify what can be the right

45
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:11,306
product. Then comes the second step, which is market research.

46
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,366
This step is essentially an in depth analysis to validate

47
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:19,050
market needs and assess competition. This is

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,558
identifying different customer touch points.

49
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:26,510
What are the pain points? What does a customer lack in the current

50
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,206
experience that can be potentially implemented by the

51
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:34,138
product team? The third one is conceptualization.

52
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,774
This is defining a very, very clear and a demanded

53
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:41,298
product concept, and it is supposed to be based on research

54
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:45,314
insights that was done at the market research stage. Here you

55
00:03:45,352 --> 00:03:49,106
define minute and smaller parts

56
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:52,646
of the product. For example, a product needs to be red in

57
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:56,006
color because the preference of the customers was supposedly in

58
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,654
the red and the orange phase. So this is defining deeper

59
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:03,002
concept and requirements. The next one

60
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:06,890
is design and planning. At this stage, you develop

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,034
a comprehensive plan outlining the product features, the architecture

62
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:14,846
and the development roadmap. Then comes

63
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:18,314
prototyping, which is creating a preliminary version

64
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:21,210
of the product for testing and validation.

65
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,530
This can be a very initial phase of the product,

66
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,266
can be if it's a digital product, can be in gamma phases, can be in

67
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:32,482
beta phases. To identify is the prototype working fine?

68
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:36,102
Is it supposed to go? Absolutely. As is in production and

69
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:39,240
identifying issues with your product ahead of time.

70
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,762
Then there is testing and refinement via

71
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:47,650
the product and the prototype testing, you go back,

72
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,414
identify, test the multiple facets

73
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:56,250
that you've designed, do rigorous evaluation, identify processes

74
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,510
to feed in the user, feedback, incorporation,

75
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,002
and then from a forward looking roadmap,

76
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:06,942
you refine the product. And then comes the final step,

77
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:10,714
which is the launch and the post launch monitoring. At this stage,

78
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:14,834
when you're launching, you introduce the product to the market. But the

79
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:18,498
most important part is actually monitoring its performance even

80
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:22,030
after launch and ensuring that this performance

81
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,426
leads to further improvements or developing strategies

82
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,474
to ensure success. As an organization, my topic

83
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:33,542
which is leadership 2.0, what are the traits for success here?

84
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:37,382
I think as a product manager, there are

85
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:40,474
a couple of key things that you need to be very,

86
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:43,738
very successful at. The first one is visionary thinking,

87
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:48,250
the ability to anticipate the marketing trends, vision of product

88
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,886
managers, vision of what the landscapes are going to

89
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:55,678
be, and the ability to guide teams towards

90
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:59,262
innovation is going to be very, very important. The second one

91
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:02,978
is adaptability. Embracing change and

92
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:06,894
swiftly adapting and adapting existing strategies

93
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:10,162
to ensure success. In the long run, it is

94
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:13,710
imperative to thrive in this dynamic tech environment.

95
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,094
Imagine how many products have become obsolete, how many

96
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:20,534
products have changed, the requirements of the customers have

97
00:06:20,572 --> 00:06:23,894
changed. Imagine the whole boom of technology at

98
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:27,470
this age. The next one is communication.

99
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,206
Clear and effective communication to articulate vision,

100
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:34,982
strategy expectations, fostering collaboration

101
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:38,070
across team is imperative. Here. The vision,

102
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,646
the documentation cannot be just in your head. It needs to be a

103
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:45,242
part of everyone's brain, everyone's collaboration.

104
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:49,518
Whoever is participating in this journey, then comes the next part,

105
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:53,330
which is a special one for me, which is empathy.

106
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,910
As a product manager, if you come with empathy,

107
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,126
understanding the customer needs and understanding

108
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:03,426
what their pain points are become easier. Also,

109
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:05,970
you become a winner in the team dynamics.

110
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,590
Understanding the market nuances and driving products

111
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,186
to resonate with users to actually develop truly

112
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:16,998
a winning product becomes easier. So empathy definitely is a

113
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,746
key. Now the challenges of

114
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:24,890
developing and managing product lifecycles

115
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,758
I think in my view there are three key challenges,

116
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:31,470
the first one being communication challenges.

117
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,402
Communication challenges can happen between multiple stakeholders

118
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:39,706
because there are a lot of stakeholders in this journey. Development teams,

119
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:44,026
key stakeholders like leadership, cross functional

120
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:47,774
teams can be a big challenge. Then the second one is time

121
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:51,042
and pressures. While everyone has the time

122
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,754
to develop the product, we also need to balance the need

123
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:58,486
for speedy development and ensuring that the quality of

124
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:01,734
the product is what it is supposed to be and

125
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:05,734
at the same time that the customers actually require the solution. While you can

126
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:09,674
develop an amazing product ten years down the line, that the customer do they really

127
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:13,770
need it? Also, the fact that you might not have the luxury of

128
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,626
everything tech from tech investment at

129
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:21,440
your luxury in your organization. So you need to balance out

130
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,710
timeline pressures are often at crunch resource allocations,

131
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,286
efficiency and managing resources is

132
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:34,050
one of the key challenges that I go through as a product manager.

133
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,410
Managing conflicting priorities within the team can be absolutely complex.

134
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,966
Strategies that I use often to overcome these challenges

135
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:47,160
are collaborative tools. For example,

136
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,070
using Asana Slack confluence to bring everyone together

137
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,470
in the team and define clear timelines, define clear ownership

138
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,614
doing product tracking documentation on an ongoing basis

139
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:03,914
becomes imperative to not just keep a track

140
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:07,514
for yourself, but communicate to the stakeholders on what is happening.

141
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:10,338
The second one is agile methodologies.

142
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:14,330
Embracing agile methodologies like scrum promotes iterative

143
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,790
development, adaptability and continuous improvement.

144
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,910
Then fostering a culture of innovation,

145
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,594
product development and product launches is not

146
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:28,494
a one time thing. I think it's a culture that is important. So cultivating

147
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:32,654
an environment that encourages creativity, problem solving

148
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:36,038
is crucial for sustained development of not just yourself,

149
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:39,958
but your team. Like any other

150
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:44,390
team in Appison, what I've learned is the classic

151
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,940
two pizza team in which there is a smaller team

152
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,686
and these are key contributors that are absolutely required to deliver

153
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,906
a successful product. And it

154
00:09:56,928 --> 00:10:00,810
is enough to share two pizzas within the team

155
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,222
and everyone has their appetite satiated. But at the same

156
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:07,070
time it is successful,

157
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,334
timeline driven and it is also ensured to

158
00:10:12,372 --> 00:10:16,226
reduce any kind of bureaucracy that can potentially happen in the

159
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,250
process. It is a very, very common concept in Amazon.

160
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,690
Then as a product manager,

161
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,426
developing teams and managing development roadmaps

162
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,566
can be absolutely tricky in this case.

163
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:35,778
If you see there are three key challenges

164
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:40,922
that I always come across and

165
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:44,746
I use key strategies to always

166
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:48,394
come back and get my anchor back

167
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:51,690
to my journey. I think it starts with business impact

168
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,114
assessment often when product managers are confused

169
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:57,950
as to what to look at, what to prioritize,

170
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,394
it is necessary to evaluate whether the product and its features

171
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:06,178
have the potential to drive the key goals for business. For example,

172
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:09,874
it can be revenue, it can be growth, it can be any kind of

173
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:13,778
custom account, it can be profits. Depending on what the business is actually

174
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:17,350
aimed at, the product should deliver in line with that.

175
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,490
The second one is strategic alignment. So ensuring

176
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,158
that the product roadmap and the vision is aligned with the business

177
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:28,402
objectives, not just for now, but in the long term.

178
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:31,914
It cannot be that your product is conflicting with what

179
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:35,386
the organization wants in the long run. So pivoting and adapting to the

180
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,900
strategic vision is absolutely important.

181
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,306
The next one is user feedback. Analysis qualifies.

182
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:46,874
Incorporate any kind of user feedback to identify which features

183
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:50,698
are priority zero. Absolutely. Which are non negotiable,

184
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:54,862
priority one which are important but can be deprioritized,

185
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:58,622
for example, in the next six to twelve months. This is imperative

186
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:02,098
to balance any kind of resource utilization and at the

187
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:04,340
same time ensuring maximum success.

188
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,154
If I tell you Amazon works on a very customer centric

189
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:12,630
approach and we often prioritize features, for example,

190
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,582
which enhances user experience over a lot of times

191
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:20,106
just driving profitability, for example.

192
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:24,502
This helps us always go back and pivot our approach whenever

193
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:28,330
required. And whenever there is a conflicting view on product development,

194
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,640
the next one is I want to talk about is

195
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,598
the data driven approach. I think one thing that Amazon has absolutely

196
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:40,910
taught me is relying on data

197
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,006
for 100% of decision making. As a product manager,

198
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:48,366
data is the coolest tool and absolutely it is a non

199
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:50,820
negotiable tool for developing great products.

200
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,410
As a product manager,

201
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,162
I, and for that matter, everyone uses

202
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:01,686
and measures success through key metrics which are absolutely

203
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:04,310
business relevant. For example,

204
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,686
user engagement, tracking any kind of interactions that

205
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,714
the users have had with your product,

206
00:13:10,912 --> 00:13:14,166
such as time spent on the app or features

207
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:17,302
that were absolutely used or click through rate to gauge

208
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:20,766
is the product actually relevant to the end customer?

209
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:24,480
The second one can be conversion rates. For example,

210
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,466
is the product actually resulting in any kind of conversion?

211
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:33,038
Is it resulting in any kind of sale? Then a

212
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:36,754
very key important one can be customer satisfaction. In this

213
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:39,794
case, identifying while the customer is actually using it.

214
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:43,346
Are they truly happy with the product or not? And then the

215
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:46,130
fourth one being retention rate. Yes,

216
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,478
the customer can be unhappy, but sometimes they don't leave the product.

217
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:53,638
Retention rate is the key to identify what is that ticking point that the customer

218
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:57,334
refuses to use your product, ideally on a

219
00:13:57,372 --> 00:14:01,094
standard basis. Retention shouldn't be like retention

220
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:04,474
should be less than 2%, and most

221
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:08,074
customers and most products should not reach to that point. But retention rate is still

222
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:11,510
an imperative metric, and tracking these metrics,

223
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,006
not just these, but any kind of business relevant metrics, are absolutely

224
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:18,286
important to go back and identify if you're going on

225
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:21,886
the right direction or not as a part of

226
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:25,250
the product journey. Once the product

227
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,818
lifecycle has started, it just doesn't end

228
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:33,410
at launching the product and post launch.

229
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,066
Once the launch has been completed, there are multiple techniques for

230
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:42,738
managing the product lifecycle, the first one being sunsetting.

231
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:46,726
It is almost like strategically retiring products that are no

232
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:50,374
longer relevant or aligned with the marketing trends

233
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:53,660
or even organizational goals. For example,

234
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,430
Amazon actually discontinued Kindle Voyage,

235
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,398
which was an e reader, in response to changing customer

236
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:04,686
preferences and advancement in the Kindle technology.

237
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:08,666
The second one can be pivoting. Yes, the product can be a successful

238
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:12,722
product at launch, but adapting the product strategy based on market

239
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:15,986
feedback or shift in the industry trend is really important.

240
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:19,458
In case of Amazon, Amazon Echo actually

241
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,994
started as a voice activated assistant, which then

242
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:26,750
evolved to evolving like a complete smart

243
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,210
home hub as a one spot,

244
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,614
one size fits all kind of a product. The last one

245
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:38,362
is continuous iteration. Implementing any kind of

246
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:42,582
ongoing improvements and updates to enhance product value and competitiveness

247
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:47,258
is an absolute must for long term success.

248
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:50,150
For example, in case of Amazon,

249
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,042
Amazon prime membership program keeps adding these new features,

250
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,534
some kind of new benefits. There are always while

251
00:15:57,572 --> 00:16:00,990
there is a standalone app, there are for example,

252
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,306
wine program that got launched or you as an

253
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:08,802
end customer keep getting better updates on more

254
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:12,178
products to try based on your

255
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:15,734
purchase history. Right? All of these

256
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:19,958
strategies revolve around developing and evolving products

257
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:23,266
post launch as well. I have listed

258
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:27,106
down some key resources

259
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:30,658
which can be utilized for enhancing your knowledge.

260
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:35,954
Not just knowledge, but actually skills and understanding

261
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:38,840
deeper details of product management here.

262
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,798

263
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:46,362
available. You can reach out to me on LinkedIn.

264
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:47,020
