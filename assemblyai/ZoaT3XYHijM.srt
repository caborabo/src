00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,804
Hi everyone, I'm Sasha Jend. I am here to speak about

2
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:34,844
the topic adapting to change navigating through market shifts in the tech

3
00:00:34,884 --> 00:00:38,540
industry the tech industry is a whirlwind of innovation.

4
00:00:38,692 --> 00:00:42,500
Whats cutting edge today could be obsolete tomorrow. The rapid pace

5
00:00:42,532 --> 00:00:45,684
of change presents a constant challenge for businesses.

6
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:49,268
How to stay relevant? How to stay competitive in a market

7
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:53,100
thats perpetually changing? The answer lies in developing a

8
00:00:53,132 --> 00:00:57,136
culture of adaptability, one that thrives on navigating change and

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,416
embracing market trends. I will further explore the importance of

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,096
staying informed about market trends. What are the key strategies

11
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,784
for adapting to them, and the benefits of fostering a culture of continuous

12
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:13,048
learning in the tech industry. Let's touch upon the point on

13
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:16,672
how do we stay ahead of the curve and how do we understand these market

14
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:20,096
trends? What are these market trends? How would it

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,444
lead to the foundation of successful adaptation? It lies

16
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:27,204
in the deep understanding of the market landscape. This requires

17
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:30,724
constant vigilance in monitoring trends that can impact your

18
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:34,300
business. Building that kind of market intelligence and sharing across your

19
00:01:34,332 --> 00:01:38,012
teams and businesses is very important. Here are some of the key areas that I

20
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:40,864
would double down on based on my professional experience.

21
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:45,588
Emerging technologies keeping yourself updated on the latest technological

22
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:48,744
advancements such as artificial intelligence,

23
00:01:49,164 --> 00:01:52,836
blockchain, or even the Internet of Things. These technologies

24
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,732
have the potential to disrupt entire industries, and early adopters

25
00:01:56,788 --> 00:02:00,532
can leverage them to gain a significant competitive

26
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:04,044
advantage. The second bit that I would focus on is

27
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:07,700
understanding the shift in consumer behavior. Consumer preferences

28
00:02:07,732 --> 00:02:11,044
are evolving rapidly. Understanding these shifts,

29
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:14,848
whether it's a growing demand for cloud based solutions, a focus

30
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:18,256
on data privacy, or even the rise of experience economy,

31
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,724
allows businesses to tailor their products and services to meet their customer needs.

32
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:27,004
The other piece that I would talk about is the regulatory changes.

33
00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:30,760
Given the advancement and the ever evolving and the

34
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:34,560
rapid change in technology and integration of the same across different

35
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:38,680
industries and businesses, regulators have also become a significant

36
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:42,210
part of consideration. Given a lot of these

37
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:46,026
new technologies have no predecessing

38
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,722
experiences or deliverables in the market, regulators are

39
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:53,874
also trying to learn in the process. The regulatory environment around technology

40
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:57,698
is also constantly changing. Staying informed about upcoming

41
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:01,626
regulations like data security measures or privacy laws

42
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,834
ensures that your business remains compliant, and it also helps in avoiding

43
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:09,762
any potential disruption. A lot of times, having a seat in

44
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:12,890
the table with the regulators will also provide a

45
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:17,042
platform to voice your opinion and actually help regulators

46
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:20,986
in forming laws which are right for the business, right for the consumers, and right

47
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,094
for the market. So what are these strategies for adapting to change?

48
00:03:25,674 --> 00:03:29,754
After understanding the market trends, it's important to translate

49
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:33,602
that kind of knowledge into action. Here are some of the key strategies

50
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:36,860
for adapting the businesses to the ever changing

51
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:40,304
tech landscape. One is embracing agility.

52
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:44,388
Traditional, rigid business models struggles to adapt quickly.

53
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:48,484
Developing an agile approach allows the companies to make

54
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,756
swift adjustments to strategies and even operations in response

55
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,772
to market trends. This can actually include

56
00:03:55,868 --> 00:04:00,068
breaking down silos between departments, encouraging cross functional

57
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:03,624
collaborations, and empowering employees to make decisions.

58
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:07,596
This also means as much as the top down approach is

59
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,604
there, there has to be a ground up approach in the companies to ensure that

60
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:15,436
employees are getting a platform to voice their opinion about the market, what's happening

61
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,036
in the market, what is their reading and what are they observing. The second piece

62
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,244
that I would talk about is data driven decision making.

63
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:25,564
In today's data rich environment, leveraging the power of

64
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:29,204
analytics to gain valuable insights into market trends is very

65
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:33,792
important. Analyzing consumer behavior, tracking competitors strategies,

66
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:38,392
and measuring the effectiveness of your own initiatives

67
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:42,360
across various programs offerings is very, very important.

68
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:46,928
Data driven decisions provide a solid foundation of strategic planning

69
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:50,884
and ensuring that the business remains relevant and competitive.

70
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:54,984
The third piece that I would talk about, which also is a

71
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:58,860
critical foundation of this session, is to

72
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:02,340
continue invest in continuous learning. A lot of times when

73
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:05,980
businesses are regressively looking at top line numbers or even bottom

74
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:09,708
line numbers, they lose the track of having a continuous

75
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:13,436
learning and training program for their employees. This means that

76
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,972
tech industry, as much as progressing ahead, is also

77
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:20,460
not supporting the employees in their learnings or even in upscaling

78
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,722
the tech industry demands a lifelong learning mindset.

79
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:28,158
Encouraging your employees to stay updated on the latest advancements through professional

80
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:31,994
development programs or workshop or even conferences is very important.

81
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:35,998
Fostering a culture of continuous learning ensures your team

82
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:39,326
has the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate change and

83
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,662
even embracing new opportunities. Building a

84
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:45,990
culture of kit innovation is the next piece of the puzzle that I would

85
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:49,606
talk about. The idea is to not be afraid

86
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,862
of experimenting and exploring new ideas. Having a culture in the organization

87
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:58,126
which allows employees to actually fail

88
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,806
and learn is very, very important. As much it is to succeed in your

89
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,598
products and offerings to the consumer. Encouraging this culture of innovation

90
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:09,102
within the organization, where employees feel empowered to take calculated

91
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:11,514
risk and develop creative solutions,

92
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:15,638
is the way where employees are able to actually deliver on

93
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:19,450
the learnings that they have had. This can lead to creative creation

94
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:23,106
of groundbreaking new products, services and business models time and again across

95
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,354
different tech industry players. We have seen one of the employees

96
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:29,554
taking a proactive initiative to actually fail on something,

97
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:33,266
to create something bigger in the long term. Now,

98
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,754
when I have spoken about market trends, when I have spoken about.

99
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:40,650
What are the strategies for adapting to those change and to ensure

100
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:44,478
that you are prepared for those changing and shifting market trends?

101
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:48,678
I would also like to talk about that. What is the benefit of these

102
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:52,254
having an adaptable tea kind of solution for

103
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:56,094
your own self and for your companies? Adapting to market trends

104
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:59,994
isn't just about survival, it's about thriving in a competitive environment.

105
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:03,854
Some of the things that I would like to count on as benefits of fostering

106
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:07,814
a culture of adaptability. First, you increase market share.

107
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:11,530
By staying ahead of the curve and responding to customer needs,

108
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:15,042
businesses can actually attract new customers and gain a competitive

109
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:18,386
advantage. At the same time, you are able to build a

110
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,014
lot of equity trust with your existing customers.

111
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:25,306
Enhance customer satisfaction. By understanding and adapting to

112
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,178
evolving customer preferences, businesses can create product and services

113
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:32,970
that truly resonate with their target audience, leading to higher customer

114
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:36,582
satisfaction, loyalty and stickiness, and improved innovation.

115
00:07:36,678 --> 00:07:40,342
A culture of continuous learning and exploration fosters a

116
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:44,294
fertile ground for innovation. This can lead to the development

117
00:07:44,374 --> 00:07:48,030
of groundbreaking new technologies and solutions that propel the

118
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:51,790
industry forward, building resilience in the face of

119
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:55,022
change the tech industry is inherently

120
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:59,118
volatile. Businesses that can adapt quickly to market

121
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,480
shifts are better equipped to weather unexpected

122
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:06,084
disruptions and even emerge stronger on the other side.

123
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:10,032
So, in conclusion, I cannot talk

124
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:13,512
more about the fact that in the dynamic world of technology,

125
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:17,200
the only constant is businesses that can

126
00:08:17,232 --> 00:08:20,936
embrace adaptability and develop strategies for navigating

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,008
market trends are the ones that will not only survive,

128
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:27,964
but thrive in this ever evolving landscape.

129
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:32,052
By fostering a culture of continuous learning and driving

130
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:35,916
innovation and data driven decision making, tech companies can

131
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,796
position themselves to become leaders in the industry and

132
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,604
actually shape the future of technology and build that narrative. That's about

133
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:44,404
it. Thank you.
