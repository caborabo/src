00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,548
Hello everyone. Today I'm going to talk about the biggest challenge that

2
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:34,204
many designers and engineers and startups are facing

3
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:38,100
is building a design system within limited time frames.

4
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:41,692
So time constraints can make it tough to start,

5
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:44,916
maintain, keep consistent and scale.

6
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,700
So we'll explore strategies to overcome these obstacles

7
00:00:48,812 --> 00:00:52,476
over your approaches to protest components

8
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,036
and dive into different plugins and AI tools to

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,250
build design system faster. So first thing first,

10
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:04,714
let me introduce myself. Currently I'm working

11
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:08,882
at Poly AI and I'm designing better user experience for

12
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,106
conversational AI systems. I have more

13
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,682
than nine years of experience as a product UIx designer

14
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:19,642
and also work with multiple design systems for large

15
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:23,540
companies and tiny startups. Also in the past and

16
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:27,428
right now, I have multiple degrees as an accountant

17
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:31,972
and digital designer and I really love mentoring designers

18
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:35,684
and help them at early stages of their career. But why

19
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:39,348
design system? Probably you heard a lot,

20
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:43,188
that design system is really helpful. It makes

21
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:46,996
companies deliver feature faster, it helps engineers to

22
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,580
reuse code and also it increases revenue and

23
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,988
just reduce time spending on design

24
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:58,340
components and tickets. It's really beneficial for

25
00:01:58,372 --> 00:02:02,412
companies, especially startups, to spend time on designing

26
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:06,668
and creating building design system because using

27
00:02:06,716 --> 00:02:09,784
design system is all about saving time and money.

28
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:14,356
But it's also challenging when you start working on

29
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,282
design system, which means you, you should think about consistency.

30
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:22,050
Also you usually have resource limitation

31
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:26,826
and also communicational gaps and you need to align your stakeholders

32
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,962
and other departments. And also usually you have technical constraints

33
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:34,506
and issues with adoption. But when we're talking about

34
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,650
startups, we have even more challenges.

35
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:42,534
Like usually startups don't have time to anything,

36
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:47,048
speed is really high and also roadmap is very

37
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:50,768
dense. Usually there is no sign team to

38
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:54,576
create design system and also there usually scalability issue with

39
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,760
a platform and especially with the design system itself.

40
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,524
And usually there is privatization conflicts due to roadmap.

41
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:06,984
What you should do technically when you just create your company, when you

42
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:10,320
start working on product, you can use happy

43
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:13,780
path. And just by re already

44
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:17,580
existing design system there is few platforms where you can

45
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:21,172
make it happen. So you definitely should look at

46
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:24,564
these platforms. There is a lot of design system

47
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:28,812
for different type of products, for different size

48
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:32,436
of company and different size of product. There could

49
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,276
be a really complex design system for like hundreds of components

50
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,264
and a really simple one for tiny startups who just

51
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:45,160
start date path. So you can use

52
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:48,472
this design system that already exists in.

53
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:52,152
Usually they have Figma file and files

54
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:56,244
for engineers and links to repository to use it and

55
00:03:56,784 --> 00:04:01,416
just use for your platform. But when we're talking about

56
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,832
existing products, an existing team

57
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:08,420
that already have design system or Uikit.

58
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:12,380
It means that maybe they don't

59
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:15,924
have this opportunity to use happy bug. Probably they can

60
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:20,604
improve their existing design system or move forward creating

61
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:24,308
design system. So first of all, what you should

62
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:27,700
have to create very successful design

63
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:31,292
system is to have roadmap and also long

64
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:34,572
term vision. And your design system should

65
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:37,964
be valuable for its users. So you definitely should have

66
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:41,074
users. By users I

67
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,090
mean engineers and designers and other teammates

68
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,642
who can use the design system on daily

69
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:51,714
basis. For example, usually it's designers,

70
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:55,054
engineers, qi engineers or marketing team.

71
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:58,954
And also it's all about value. So this

72
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:02,174
design system should be really valuable to its users.

73
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,774
And at the same time you should have metrics

74
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:10,544
for a design system to check if this design system is okay.

75
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:15,012
For example, this metrics could be satisfaction of your users and

76
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:18,396
you also should create some specific adoption plan how to

77
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,264
make these users used and love your design system.

78
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:26,004
So when you realize that you have users

79
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:29,144
and you need to create design system and it will be valuable,

80
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:33,250
you should start from something. So you probably

81
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:37,242
know that usually design system have really specific

82
00:05:37,298 --> 00:05:41,814
components, for example buttons, inputs, color palette,

83
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:47,306
grids and icons. So you should think

84
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,354
about prioritization, where to start, what components should go first,

85
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:53,814
what element you should build first.

86
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:59,454
In this case, there should be, there are existing

87
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:03,562
few types of prioritization. First of all, you can use

88
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:06,930
any prioritization tool you already use on your product,

89
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:11,058
for example. So technically you have four

90
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:15,330
columns, must have, should have, could have, and won't have where

91
00:06:15,362 --> 00:06:18,802
you can place any of your components. For example from

92
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:23,136
experience, usually you should place color palette, grid system

93
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,504
icons and fonts to must have.

94
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:31,564
And for example, if you are early stage startup,

95
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:36,220
so you probably don't need to think about creating

96
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:39,972
some specific components like combo books or data

97
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:43,204
pickers. So in this case it could be in a column

98
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:46,984
of one half or one half right now.

99
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:52,028
And there's another approach of prioritization.

100
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:56,314
This is technically system methodology for designing called atomic

101
00:06:56,354 --> 00:07:00,274
design where you have subatomic components such

102
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:03,482
as color palettes, typography and spacing,

103
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:07,826
and also you have other components that is more complex

104
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,314
like atoms. You see this could be icons,

105
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:13,854
buttons, labels or inputs,

106
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:18,586
molecules, organisms, and more complex elements

107
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,418
such as pages. And usually work starts from

108
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:26,050
subatomic and atoms. And then you go to

109
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:30,242
the more complex one, one more prioritization thing.

110
00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:34,378
Prioritization methods is roadmap based.

111
00:07:34,506 --> 00:07:37,554
So technically you can see, just imagine this is your

112
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:41,194
roadmap. You have features on this roadmap and it means

113
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:44,586
that you can start working on design

114
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,650
systems, you work on your feature. So technical case close

115
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,894
to atomic design,

116
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,024
atomic methodology,

117
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:57,660
because at the beginning you should work on the

118
00:07:57,692 --> 00:08:00,492
most basic components such as colors, buttons,

119
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:04,892
inputs, and then you go further with second

120
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:08,504
feature, there could be different components, so it could be input.

121
00:08:08,884 --> 00:08:12,932
So usually with this approach, with this roadmap

122
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:16,348
based approach, there will be lots of work. At the beginning

123
00:08:16,516 --> 00:08:21,496
with your design system and then closely

124
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,944
closer to the middle of your roadmap,

125
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:28,472
you will see that your design system is already ready.

126
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:32,280
So most components are already used. I might say from

127
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:36,680
my experience, I usually use atomic approach

128
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:40,224
and roadmap based approach and sometimes I

129
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:43,440
use something like collaboration

130
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:48,730
mix of these approaches. But usually I start from subatomic

131
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:52,410
components such as colors and color palette, and then

132
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:56,738
I go with features and components that is

133
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,242
connected to each feature. And I might say I really

134
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:03,978
recommend these two approaches like roadmap

135
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:06,174
based and atomic design approach.

136
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:10,674
So since we agreed, and you agreed on moving

137
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:13,334
forward with some specific approach of prioritization,

138
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:17,052
it means you should think about process of

139
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:20,716
creating your design system. So first thing first you

140
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,124
should think about why

141
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:28,228
do we need this component? So this is discovery stage,

142
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:32,236
the same as working on every feature. You would have discovery,

143
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,224
design development and release. And also you can go

144
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:39,304
back and forward in some steps.

145
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:44,244
And also you can see there's few additional steps

146
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:48,392
in each of this phase. So there should be

147
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:51,144
audit, discussion, scoping,

148
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:54,624
kickoff. Then there should be exploration,

149
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:58,928
user testing of course, and documentation at each

150
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:02,224
step. And also when you release, you also should

151
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:05,888
think about announcement because you have users and

152
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:09,786
you should definitely share what's different,

153
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,546
what's new in your design system. And also you should have metrics to

154
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,810
check. Sometimes you may not have metrics.

155
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:20,706
For example, there are five people who are using design system and

156
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,894
the metrics you can have with just satisfaction.

157
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:28,322
And technically yes, you have metric, but at

158
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:32,050
the same time it's not that metric as you probably could have

159
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:35,276
on your product because your

160
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,104
metric is your user feedback, definitely.

161
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:42,084
So what's next? We understand what

162
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:45,628
approach to use, you understand what process can

163
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:49,220
be. So next step is design phase.

164
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:53,276
So color palette is the most basic

165
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,908
element of your design system, but also time consuming.

166
00:10:57,036 --> 00:11:00,712
Work on color palette can take from few hours

167
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:04,524
to few weeks, depends. So instead of

168
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:09,488
spending time on this basic element, basic element

169
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:13,680
of your design system, you should use these plugins on

170
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:16,724
figma to generate your color palette.

171
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:22,904
I will show on my presentation only plugins for figma

172
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:26,616
because last five years I use figma only and I

173
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,006
know that number for designers who are using figma is

174
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,966
growing every year. So if you use sketch,

175
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,190
I'm really sorry but currently I'm sharing everything about

176
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:41,830
figma. So as you can see you can use this

177
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:45,302
plugin on figma to generate your color

178
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:48,886
palette. Then also you can use this plugin to

179
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,254
create your color palette as the styles

180
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:56,484
and variables. Or you can use this plugin that

181
00:11:56,524 --> 00:12:00,084
also have an AI to generate

182
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:04,252
your color palette. Creates everything styles

183
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:07,780
based on pictures or image or your printing

184
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:11,676
guidelines. So I absolutely recommend to use any of

185
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,304
this plugin to create your color scheme.

186
00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:18,532
Typography is also time consuming. You also

187
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:22,700
can spend from hours today to create your typography

188
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:26,182
styles and sometimes it's really

189
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,646
challenging when you have already existing product and you

190
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,238
need to gather everything together. So this plugin

191
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:36,758
can really help you to save hours of your

192
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:40,086
life by just some of

193
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,574
them gathering all color styles that you already have on your mockups and figma.

194
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:48,350
Some of them help you to create type

195
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:51,994
scale specifically for your needs.

196
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:55,154
So I definitely recommend to use any of this.

197
00:12:55,854 --> 00:13:00,270
Next is icons. Why icons?

198
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:04,190
It's really interesting because designers already

199
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:07,590
designed like thousands of different versions of

200
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,710
home icon. You can find it everywhere.

201
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:14,982
So instead of again spending hours on this basic

202
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:19,610
element such as icon, you can buy already existing

203
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:23,530
icon set on this website for example.

204
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,834
Or you can use any of plugins that you can find

205
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:30,346
on figma, for example material symbols or

206
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,394
the same plugin from iOS. So it will help you save

207
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,946
hours of your life on creation these icons.

208
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,698
But again, there is a lot of other

209
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:45,290
icons that you can find on different other websites.

210
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:49,416
So I think you definitely could find something that's

211
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,056
really suitable for your branding for your website to make a

212
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,776
shiny and save time. What else?

213
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,024
I would like also share my thoughts about these three

214
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:04,920
plugins because these three plugins are just

215
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:08,080
recently showed up and they're in beta version.

216
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:11,680
But what they can do previously on previous

217
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:14,864
slides I shared that you can create icons,

218
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:18,200
colors and typography by using different plugins.

219
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:21,992
And these plugins on this slide there can do

220
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:26,416
everything, but you need to prompt,

221
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,944
you just need to prompt what you would like to create.

222
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:32,904
Unfortunately, these plugins again embedded version, it means they are not that

223
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:36,608
functional as they can be. But in the future I

224
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:41,176
see that by prompting them, by adding few lines

225
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,828
of text, you can create your own design system.

226
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:48,424
Currently they can create styles, color fonts and few really simple

227
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:52,204
design components. Design system components, but that's it.

228
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:55,364
But anyway, they're really powerful and

229
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:59,004
instead of having like five or ten plugins

230
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:03,044
for different reasons, you can use any of this and

231
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:06,980
it's really could help you save time. And when

232
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:10,244
we're talking about designing, it's not the end

233
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:14,348
after design. Usually we should go to the development phase.

234
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:18,094
So we should move up design for Figma two code.

235
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:22,954
Unfortunately, and fortunately there is not that many plugins

236
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:27,058
or tools that can help you move your Figma

237
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:30,826
file or design on Figma to code because Figma already did

238
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,202
it. Figma introduced depth mode that

239
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:37,602
help you just copy this code

240
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:40,922
that Figma generate and paste it to your repository,

241
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:44,744
to your files and it's really helpful. Unfortunately, there is

242
00:15:44,784 --> 00:15:48,016
no other tools that can do something

243
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,608
better and there is not that many tools that you can

244
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:55,024
try really. But using dev mode is really

245
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:58,584
beneficial for our team. So it definitely

246
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,244
should help you to build your design system faster.

247
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:05,364
And also when we're talking about building design system,

248
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:09,904
usually I see that people and other companies and

249
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:14,006
other teams use storybooks as a visualization

250
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:18,274
of what you can find on Figma, what you can see on code.

251
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:22,846
So it's really helpful. It helps engineers to understand what's going on,

252
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,902
what other state, what other patterns or styles you should

253
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,958
use, or it also help with version control.

254
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:34,750
So storybook or its alternative is

255
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:38,078
definitely really helpful to save time and help with

256
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,994
communication between different departments.

257
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:45,334
Also, when we're talking about design system, it's all about

258
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:49,942
documentation and guidelines. I might say that

259
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,870
when we're talking about documentation, first thing first, what we're thinking about

260
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:57,470
is chat DPT. There is no longer need to

261
00:16:57,502 --> 00:17:01,286
have open tab of chat VPT because

262
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,614
you can find this plugin and figma

263
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:07,848
that also have chat DPT. So it means that

264
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:11,400
you just open this plugin and prompt few

265
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:14,124
lines of text about what you're gonna choose,

266
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:17,840
what you going to generate and this plugin

267
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:21,248
will do everything. I use it a lot in the past,

268
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:24,672
I will use it already for my design system. I'm working on

269
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:28,016
design system and it's really helpful. Also when we're talking

270
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,160
about design system and components, it's usually all

271
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:34,732
about anatomy of components, means you

272
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:38,564
should use and you could use and I recommend to

273
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:42,460
use this eight shaped specs plugin because it

274
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:46,140
really helped to highlight these different measurements

275
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:50,436
between components, space between components and

276
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,036
everything and leave comments and

277
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,420
some specific details for your

278
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:01,010
engineer. Definitely should use it. And when

279
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,254
we talking about documentation,

280
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:08,042
these applications are hey is really helpful

281
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:11,866
because this is perfect place where you can place

282
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,306
everything, all documentation that you have for both engineers

283
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,634
and designers and for third parties or other departments

284
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:23,922
in one place. You just create one page

285
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:28,256
where you explain everything about some specific component,

286
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,176
or you can explain patterns or use cases for

287
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,288
specific elements. So it's really helpful to use this

288
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:40,364
app as a source of truth for everyone.

289
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:45,688
And since we already discussed components

290
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:49,128
and where to place it and how to move it from

291
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:52,480
design to engineering, we also should think about

292
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:56,574
scalability. Because yes, we have users,

293
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:01,874
our design system is valuable and how to scale,

294
00:19:01,994 --> 00:19:05,434
because when you cannot scale, it means that your

295
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:09,538
design system would be really hard, really difficult

296
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:13,226
to maintain. You could spend a lot of hours

297
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,442
on just creating new components and there will be no scalability

298
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:20,232
at all. And eventually you can just

299
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:23,872
lost your users and metrics gone wrong

300
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:29,064
and there is no option at all. So you

301
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:32,472
can try to make your design system scalable just

302
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:36,504
to add a lot of collaboration between different departments and

303
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:40,304
collaboration between users and people who are building this

304
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:43,536
design system, because this collaboration

305
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,908
can help to understand point of improvements

306
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:51,924
or weak points or this strength of design

307
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:55,676
system. So collaboration is essential for building

308
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,676
scalable design system. And when we're talking about scalability

309
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,544
is all about documentation. So everything should be documented

310
00:20:04,964 --> 00:20:08,932
and your design system should be flexible and modular.

311
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:12,344
Because when you cannot create your design system,

312
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:16,030
when your design system is not that scalable,

313
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:19,914
not that flexible, sort, it means that

314
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:24,022
every time when you need new component, when you need specific

315
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:28,102
component, you cannot use existing one, you should create new

316
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:32,294
one. And it means that you would end up

317
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:36,794
with a lot of the same, very similar to each other components.

318
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:42,244
You will end up with a lot of documentation for all of them.

319
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,404
It's definitely should, you should definitely try to avoid

320
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,512
creating a lot of components. And you should definitely think about

321
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:52,924
adding flexibility to this component.

322
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:58,296
And your design system is all about version control. Because if

323
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,656
your design system is evolving, if you create a new

324
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,128
component, if you add in documentation, you should definitely think

325
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:08,520
about how to show versioning,

326
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:11,768
how to help user to understand that this button

327
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:15,400
is the most relevant one and previous one

328
00:21:15,432 --> 00:21:19,244
issue duplicated. So version control is everything too.

329
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:23,648
And once you done with everything, you create

330
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:27,124
scalable design system, next step is adoption.

331
00:21:27,784 --> 00:21:31,808
If your design system have value and also have users,

332
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:36,012
it means that you should educate and train all users that

333
00:21:36,068 --> 00:21:39,836
can possibly work with your design system. Because training

334
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,344
and education is the most essential one for adoption.

335
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,156
Because people should know what to use and how to

336
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,464
use this component. And also it's all about feedback.

337
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:55,124
And if you would like to scale your design

338
00:21:55,204 --> 00:21:58,716
system and make it living and breathing,

339
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,516
you should think about improvements and how to improve is

340
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,604
just gathering feedback because user will say, will tell

341
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:10,484
you what should be improved. And also to

342
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:14,540
make your design system perfect for adoption

343
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:17,664
is your design system should be

344
00:22:18,564 --> 00:22:21,584
impactful for users, for company,

345
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:25,204
because if there is no impact, there is

346
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:28,998
no chance that company will use it and users will use it.

347
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:32,730
And we're talking about people who are

348
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:36,906
creating Zen systems. So it's all about recognition because people

349
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,674
who build Zen systems should be motivated and they

350
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:44,506
should be recognized. So it's just tiny thing,

351
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,386
but recognition is something that

352
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,374
should be done for better adoption.

353
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:55,594
