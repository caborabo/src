00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,680
Hello everyone. Today, we are diving into a fascinated

2
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:34,312
the impact of artificial intelligence on creative

3
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,736
thinking in design. We will explore how AI

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,816
and human creativity intersect and how they are

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,360
shaping our future. AI is having a deep

6
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:49,096
impact on the evolution of design, shaping innovations,

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,924
and transforming creative workflows worldwide.

8
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,990
Before we begin, maybe we should define some

9
00:00:57,062 --> 00:01:00,534
creativity. I guess it's the ability to

10
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:04,006
think outside the box, to come up with new ideas,

11
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,314
and to solve problems in innovative ways.

12
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:10,958
Also making connections between

13
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:15,062
unrelated things and also producing something original

14
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,982
or innovative. Take risks and

15
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,354
embrace failure. It's a fundamental aspect of creativity.

16
00:01:23,914 --> 00:01:28,114
Now let's talk about how AI and humans

17
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:32,514
differ in creativity. AI and artificial

18
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:36,658
intelligence can be creative by using data and

19
00:01:36,786 --> 00:01:41,370
algorithms, but it lacks human emotional emotions

20
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:44,586
and experiences. Human creativity

21
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,658
comes from feelings, thoughts, and culture

22
00:01:48,746 --> 00:01:51,404
make it more complex and unique.

23
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:56,816
While AI can produce innovative solutions,

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,216
it may lack the depth and intuition that

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,004
humans bring to creative tasks.

26
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:07,184
Human creativity often involves

27
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:10,656
personal connection, sympathy, and, for example,

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,328
understanding, which is harder for AI to

29
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:17,024
replicate. As a result,

30
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:21,184
while AI can excel in certain areas,

31
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:25,444
human creativity remains essential for many

32
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:27,824
aspects of life and work.

33
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:32,244
The best practice is to combine AI and

34
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:35,276
human creativity. So let's talk about it.

35
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,340
AI helps us understand data,

36
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:42,564
and people bring feelings and instincts.

37
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:46,804
Making new ideas better, working together combines

38
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:50,404
their capabilities, making amazing solutions.

39
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:55,192
We will see this in many areas, from design

40
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:59,120
to healthcare. Using AI as a

41
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:02,764
tool, not a replacement for people help us

42
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,724
move forward and make better things together.

43
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:10,422
The key is mixing technology with human

44
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:13,194
cleverness for a better tomorrow,

45
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:17,022
let's talk about how we can use

46
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:20,914
both artificial intelligence and human creativity

47
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:24,794
effectively together. In design,

48
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:28,774
there are some tools and methods that can make

49
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:33,154
our work easier and help us be better at our creative tasks.

50
00:03:33,654 --> 00:03:37,308
The first one is Uizert. Uizur scans

51
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:41,104
your sketches and automatically transforms them into

52
00:03:41,564 --> 00:03:44,988
editable prototypes. This service uses

53
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:48,836
machine learning machine vision to

54
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,268
turn sketches into digital screens

55
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,916
and components. If you enjoy starting interface work

56
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,532
by sketching it out on a paper, this tool

57
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:04,108
is definitely for you. With midjourney,

58
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:07,932
you can create high quality images from simple text prompts

59
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:11,332
for free. Just enter text description of the image

60
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:15,484
and get the result in a few seconds. This is very,

61
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:19,108
very easy. No special hardware or software

62
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:22,892
is required to use mijourney as it runs directly in

63
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:25,424
the browser of your computer or phone.

64
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:29,404
Dali two is an advanced version of the artificial

65
00:04:29,444 --> 00:04:32,344
intelligence model developed by OpenAI,

66
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:36,688
capable of generating images based on textual

67
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:40,584
descriptions. It's an evolution of the original

68
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:45,084
daily model, which was introduced in early 2021.

69
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:49,000
Utilizes deep learning technologies to create

70
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:52,568
unique and creative images that match

71
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:56,624
the given text. Visual electric is the first

72
00:04:56,744 --> 00:05:00,480
image generator designed for creatives,

73
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,444
and it's like a canvas that facilitates the flow

74
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:08,940
of ideas so you just can truly spread out and see

75
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:12,564
where the tool takes you. It's like, you know Figma.

76
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:16,020
It's designed to help give form

77
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:18,748
to the vision in your mind's eye,

78
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,484
or also lead you to something even better.

79
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:26,412
Adobe Firefly is a standalone web application.

80
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:30,970
It offers new ways to create and communicate while

81
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:35,494
significantly improving creative workflows using generative AI.

82
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:40,214
It's designed to be safe for commercial use.

83
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:44,722
The next one is magician. Magician is

84
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:49,294
magical design tool for Figma powered by AI

85
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:53,834
design with the power of AI to do everything from copywriting to

86
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:57,564
generating unique icons from text. I have

87
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:01,372
included only a few tools in this presentation that

88
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:05,944
will help you create professionals expand their creative potential.

89
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:10,772
To discover even more tools for enhancing creativity,

90
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:14,572
visit tools design all

91
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:18,532
right, what do you think about can AI

92
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,628
truly replicate the unique creativity and intuition?

93
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,610
Or creative, creative professionals?

94
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:29,914
While technology advanced rapidly, the essence

95
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:33,930
of creativity remains a complex human trait. AI may

96
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:37,866
enhance but cannot fully replace the creative spark

97
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,334
that defines our imagination and innovation.

98
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:46,466
Let's explore that AI learned by

99
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,812
studying what already exists. It get

100
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,784
smarter by using data from the past.

101
00:06:53,244 --> 00:06:57,028
But when it comes to creating new stuff, AI isn't

102
00:06:57,076 --> 00:07:00,964
as good. To be honest, it's like having a really big book

103
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:05,504
of answers, but it doesn't know how to write a new story.

104
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:09,404
While it's great at learning from what's been done before,

105
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:13,020
it's so good. It's not so good at making something

106
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:16,820
totally fresh. AI is mainly a tool at

107
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:20,686
that moment, assisting with tasks, but not

108
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,406
yet fully creative or independent. He's like a

109
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,998
reliable assistant, but still needs human

110
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:32,194
guidance for innovation and originality.

111
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:36,374
AI hasn't taken over from creative

112
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:40,270
experts, not quite yet, but anyway,

113
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:44,246
while it's great at some tasks, like data analysis or

114
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,678
repetitive work, it lacks the human touch needed for

115
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:52,006
true creativity of a helpful assistant,

116
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,486
leaving the creative decisions to humans.

117
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,510
For example, AI can assist graphic designers by

118
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:03,502
automating repetitive tasks like resizing images

119
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,926
or generating basic layout, saving them

120
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,758
valuable time to focus on their artistic aspects of their

121
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:14,500
work. AI raises ethical concerns.

122
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:18,716
Will it replace human intuition and design? How ethical

123
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,264
will AI algorithm be?

124
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:25,164
Can they avoid violating morality and laws?

125
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:29,212
These questions are crucial as AI becomes

126
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:32,332
more prevalent in various fields.

127
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:36,964
Let's answer on these questions below may

128
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:40,946
streamline processes, but losing the human

129
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,506
touch and design in a concern. Humans bring

130
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,506
intuition and emotional understanding to the

131
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,314
table elements that AI struggles to replicate.

132
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:57,306
By the way, while AI can assist in tasks like

133
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,082
generating designs or layouts. It may lack the deeper understanding

134
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:06,608
of human emotions, and maintaining

135
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:10,484
a balance between AI efficiency and human creativity

136
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:14,888
is essential to preserve

137
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,844
the integrity of design.

138
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:21,952
Also, AI might not always know

139
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,792
what is right or wrong. They can do what they

140
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:29,800
are told, but they don't have human feelings

141
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:33,584
about what is fair or not. It's really important

142
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:37,480
to make sure they don't do the right thing and follow the

143
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:41,392
law. But because AI can make its

144
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:45,224
own decisions, some people worry

145
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:48,712
it might do something wrong. We need strong rules and

146
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:52,720
ways to check on AI to stop it from doing things it

147
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:56,416
shouldn't. We have to keep an eye on AI

148
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,760
all the time and make changes when needed to

149
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:02,084
make sure it keeps doing the right thing.

150
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:06,144
Using artificial intelligence indesign opens up

151
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:09,184
new horizons for shaping the future.

152
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:14,020
Because AI aids designers in creating innovative and

153
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:17,924
functional products, ensuring unique and creative solutions.

154
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:21,892
From like, for example, automating routine

155
00:10:21,948 --> 00:10:25,864
tasks to generating unique design concepts,

156
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:30,534
AI accelerates the development processes

157
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:34,558
and enhances efficiency, thereby offering

158
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:37,966
new opportunities for designers in shaping the future.

159
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,598
Visual landscape machine learning

160
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,166
algorithms can analyze vast

161
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,774
data sets and design trends, user preferences,

162
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:53,174
and also historical data to identify patterns

163
00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:57,664
and insights. This data driving approach

164
00:10:57,784 --> 00:11:01,568
enables designers to make informed decisions,

165
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:05,688
predict trends, and tailor designs to meet specific

166
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:09,408
user needs. Also, machine learning can

167
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:13,204
help designers with repetitive design tasks.

168
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:17,160
This gives designers more time to think of

169
00:11:17,272 --> 00:11:20,816
new and cool ideas for their work. In the

170
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,864
end, machine learning makes designers faster and better,

171
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:28,124
bringing in new ideas and making designers

172
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:32,484
designs that are more about what users want.

173
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:36,656
How do you put into practice everything we

174
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,376
have talked about before? For instance, there is

175
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,496
a great example from APG company AI

176
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,314
in their work and saved money and designers resources.

177
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:52,902
APG stands for independence pet

178
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,274
Group. It's well known companies that provides pet insurance.

179
00:11:57,694 --> 00:12:01,102
They saved 90% of designers work hours,

180
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,358
saved about 50

181
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:08,670
$20,000 and generated over

182
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:12,982
750 high quality images. Their goal

183
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,034
was to create a cheerful style of illustrations for

184
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:21,906
internal communications and enrich their company's

185
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,626
internal culture. They developed 750

186
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,042
such images featuring cute household pets

187
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:36,098
using AI. Just take a look at how great

188
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:39,586
they look. It's really amazing. They used

189
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,652
the generated images for internal products and

190
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:47,060
merchandise. For instance, here is an example of

191
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:50,404
a coffee coaster featuring these

192
00:12:50,564 --> 00:12:54,012
illustrations. The entire campaign was

193
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,636
produced by a single creative team of illustrations,

194
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,620
designers and copywriters, showing how powerful

195
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:05,624
AI can be in the hands of talented humans.

196
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:09,036
When we mix AI with human creativity,

197
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,302
we keep the feelings and understanding

198
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:17,558
that humans bring that also more

199
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:21,350
humans. Not one. Only AI brings new ideas,

200
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:24,718
but it's even better when humans add

201
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:28,558
their thoughts by putting them together carefully.

202
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:31,838
Human thinking stays

203
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:36,200
really important in design, making sure we still get what

204
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:39,688
feels right. AI doesn't take over

205
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:43,440
from creative people just yet, showing that human

206
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:46,848
creativity still really matters. Thank you so much for

207
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:50,856
listening to my presentation. I hope you found it inspiring and

208
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,840
discovered useful ideas that will allow you

209
00:13:54,872 --> 00:13:58,416
to use the power of AI and your creative

210
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:58,704
potential.
