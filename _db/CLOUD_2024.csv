From Baremetal to Kubernetes: YDB’s Journey,"This case study aims to demonstrate how large-scale bare-metal deployments of stateful applications, like YDB, an open-source distributed database, can be integrated into Kubernetes. It has long been assumed that Kubernetes is primarily suited for stateless applications. However, in this talk, we will explore the challenges of managing stateful workloads: for instance, how to solve a particular problem of attaching YDB to raw block devices to achieve optimal performance while maintaining security.

Additionally, Kubernetes itself offers significant value. With the help of a Kubernetes operator, maintenance tasks can be automated, ensuring database cluster awareness. For example, during version updates, it is crucial to bulk-update only the nodes that won't impact the overall performance of the database cluster.

Applications rarely require access to drives as raw block devices. In order to obtain maximum performance, YDB communicates with drives in block mode, without any filesystem. A number of issues arise. How to maintain POSIX locks on drives, so that each drive can be used only by one container at a time? We will share our experience and several useful practices developed along the way.",Egor Tarasov,,
Scaling Secrets in Kubernetes: A Secure Multi-Cluster Approach,"A secret is any piece of information that you want to keep confidential, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and SSH keys.

External Secrets Operator is an open source Kubernetes operator that integrates external secret management systems like HashiCorp Vault, Google Secrets Manager and many more. The goal of External Secrets Operator is to synchronise secrets from external APIs into Kubernetes. It reads information from external APIs and automatically injects the values into a Kubernetes Secret. If the secret from the external API changes, the controller will reconcile the state in the cluster and update the secrets accordingly.

To manage secrets across multiple Kubernetes clusters, External Secret Operator can be deployed in the management cluster. Sveltos can then be used to distribute the secrets to managed clusters.

The integration of External Secrets Operator and Sveltos enables a powerful solution for managing secrets in a Kubernetes environment.

By combining these tools, platform admin can effortlessly fetch secrets from external secret management systems and securely distribute their content to a multitude of Kubernetes clusters.

The integration of External Secrets Operator and Sveltos brings several benefits:
- Centralized Management: Secrets are managed and retrieved from external systems within the management cluster, streamlining the process and reducing complexities.
- Enhanced Security: Secrets are encrypted and stored securely in the external secret management systems, ensuring data confidentiality.
- Automated Updates: When secrets change in the external secret management systems, the External Secrets Operator automatically updates the Kubernetes Secrets in the management cluster, ensuring synchronization.
- Consistency Across Clusters: Sveltos ensures that fetched secrets are consistently distributed to all managed clusters, providing a unified and secure approach to secret management.
- Scalability: The solution is designed to scale efficiently, accommodating a multitude of Kubernetes clusters while maintaining performance and security standards.",Gianluca Mardente,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianlucamardente/

Ephemeral Environments 101,"## What are ephemeral environments?
Ephemeral environments are standalone deployments of your feature branches. In order to provide value to your SDLC, they must mimic production. This means they'll have production-like data and dependencies. Ephemeral environments are the modern answer to the archaic 24/7 staging environment: they can be spun up upon a PR, and spun down upon merge. 

## Why should I use ephemeral environments?
Running your E2E tests in staging is becoming an anti-pattern. You can shorten the inner dev loop by building environments based on each feature branch. This way, as soon as a dev completes a feature, they can run their E2E suite directly against the branch and fix any bugs right when the tests complete. Catching bugs on feature branches leads to fewer bugs in staging *and* production. 

Not only are ephemeral environments a solution for testing, but they also make cross-team collaboration easier. Instead of a screen-share Zoom call, you can send your peers SSO-enabled links to your environments. This way, they can interact with your feature branch's environment and provide async feedback.

## How do I build my own ephemeral environment solution?
Since ephemeral environments are elastic, you'll want to use Kubernetes to scale your services. Each of your app's services should exist within a container so they remain secure and are packaged with all required dependencies. It is best practice to use Docker Compose as your application definition.",Natalie Lunbeck,,

Practical AI with Machine Learning for Observability in Netdata,"Machine Learning for observability can be challenging, given the uniqueness of each workload. However, we can leverage ML to detect individual component anomalies, even if they are sometimes noisy/imprecise. At Netdata, we use ML models to analyze the behavior of individual metrics. These models adapt to the specific characteristics of each metric, ensuring anomalies can be detected accurately, even in unique workloads.

The power of ML becomes evident when these seemingly noisy anomalies converge across various services, serving as indicators of something exceedingly unusual. ML is an advisor, training numerous independent models for each individually collected metric to achieve anomaly detection based on recent behavior.

When multiple independent metrics exhibit anomalies simultaneously, it is usually a signal that something unusual is occurring. This approach to ML can be instrumental in uncovering malicious attacks and, in many cases, predicting combined failures across seemingly unrelated components.",Costa Tsaousis,,https://www.netdata.cloud/
"Forget Developer Platforms, Think Developer Productivity!","Developer platforms are getting a lot of hype right now. But that’s just something big companies do, and it means setting up a huge Kubernetes cluster and deploying Backstage. Right? Wrong! Actually, it is all about improving developer productivity, and that is important for a single developer, or a company with tens of thousands of IT professionals. It also means that the tools, services and artefacts needed to boost productivity can be widely different, and there is no default solution. 

In this talk, we will discuss the latest research on how you can measure and improve Developer Productivity. Then, we will look at actual tools and methods that make you more productive as an individual, a team or a whole company. And you might call this a developer platform, or not. That’s OK.

Advanced API Design for Scalable and Fault-Tolerant Data-Intensive Distributed Systems,"This proposal delves into RESTful principles, asynchronous operations, security considerations, techniques for optimizing data retrieval through pagination and filtering, exploration of caching and rate limiting, importance of idempotent operations and error handling in maintaining data consistency and facilitating seamless integration with evolving systems.


Learning objectives:

This topic aims to provide practical insights and guidelines for modern software engineers, architects, and developers involved in the creation and evolution of APIs for data-intensive distributed systems. By adopting the proposed advanced API design principles, organizations can achieve a balance between scalability, performance optimization and fault tolerance, ultimately contributing to the success of their distributed computing initiatives.


Advanced API Design:

1. RESTful Principles:
RESTful principles form the foundation of well-structured APIs, emphasizing stateless communication, resource-oriented design, and standard HTTP methods.
Adhering to RESTful principles ensures a standardized, scalable, and easily maintainable API architecture. It facilitates clear communication between clients and servers, promoting a consistent and predictable user experience.

2. Asynchronous Operations with Webhooks:
Asynchronous operations allow decoupling of processing tasks from the main application flow, while webhooks enable real-time communication by pushing data to subscribed servers when specific events occur.
By incorporating asynchronous operations and webhooks, APIs can handle time-consuming tasks efficiently, minimize latency, and provide real-time updates. This contributes to improved responsiveness and scalability, particularly in systems with fluctuating workloads.

3. Security:
Authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, API keys), authorization strategies, data encryption (HTTPS), and protection against common security threats.
Security measures are paramount to safeguard data integrity, confidentiality, and prevent unauthorized access or malicious attacks. Robust security practices instill trust in the API and protect sensitive information from potential breaches.

4. Pagination and Filtering:
Pagination involves breaking down large result sets into manageable pages, while filtering allows clients to request specific data based on criteria.
Pagination and filtering optimize data retrieval, reduce bandwidth consumption, and enhance API performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. This ensures efficient use of resources and minimizes response times.

5. Caching:
Caching involves storing copies of frequently accessed data to reduce redundant computations or database queries.
Caching enhances API performance by minimizing the need for repeated data retrieval. It reduces latency and conserves resources, making it particularly beneficial for read-heavy operations and improving overall system responsiveness.

6. Rate Limiting:
Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a client can make within a specified time period.
Rate limiting prevents abuse, ensures fair resource usage, and protects the API from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. It promotes stability, reliability, and fair access to resources.

7. Idempotent Operations:
Idempotent operations produce the same result regardless of how many times they are executed.
Idempotence ensures consistency in the face of network issues or retries. It reduces the risk of unintended consequences, making operations more predictable and resilient.

8. Error Handling and Resilience:
Clear, standardized error responses, along with mechanisms for graceful error handling and recovery.
Effective error handling and resilience mechanisms contribute to the overall reliability of the API. Well-designed error responses enable clients to understand and respond appropriately to unexpected situations, while resilience ensures continued functionality despite failures.

Unleash GenAI while remaining cost-effective with serverless,"GenerativeAI is rapidly reshaping the tech landscape. Its implementation, especially in intricate scenarios, often involves a sophisticated dance among application code, users, and multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). The complexity of coordinating these elements extends beyond the capabilities of basic API calls. While some vendors offer means to access LLMs, they fall short in guiding developers to construct an LLM framework that effectively balances responsiveness, accuracy, and cost-efficiency. Consequently, many projects grapple with unforeseen costs, pushing them beyond budget.

Addressing this challenge, our proposal centers on a serverless architecture. This approach adeptly orchestrates various language models, from Foundational to fine-tuned variants. It supports developers and organizations in building forward-thinking projects with specific Cloud Development Kit (CDK) constructs, tailored for effective model monitoring and coordination.

We will spotlight serverless architectures using AWS Lambda, AWS StepFunctions, and Amazon Bedrock, citing real-world applications. To streamline complexity, we transform these architectural elements into CDK constructs, offering developers a rapid and efficient launching pad for their projects.",Luca Bianchi,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucabianchipavia/
Creating Immutable Infrastructures with Kairos,"In this talk, we will introduce Kairos, an open-source project that aims to create immutable Operating Systems designed for Kubernetes. This includes a toolset that simplifies operations at the edge in a cloud-native way. 

Edge computing has become increasingly popular due to its ability to save costs by processing information closer to the data before sending filtered and computed information to a centralized application or data warehouse hosted in the cloud. Kubernetes is an ideal solution for edge computing because it natively builds components that facilitate the lifecycle management of modern edge applications.

However, as we scale the number of edge locations, we face operational challenges, such as interacting with cluster configurations at scale without creating unique configurations for each location, ensuring security for remote clusters and applications, upgrading Kubernetes clusters without specific domain knowledge, and minimizing disruptions during maintenance windows for smaller form factor hardware.

Kairos acts as an engine delivering immutable Kubernetes-enabled Linux OS from OCI conformant container images. It provides unique capabilities such as VPN peer-to-peer mesh, a distributed ledger to automate Kubernetes cluster bootstrapping and coordination, and zero-touch provisioning with a QR code scan. But more importantly, it uses a declarative model backed by Kubernetes CRDs. It manages distributed Kubernetes operations at the edge, from a centralized Kubernetes cluster.

Cloud Native Late Bloomers: Overcoming Fears and Finding Leadership,"In recent years, companies have embarked on digital transformations, embracing CNCF technologies like Kubernetes, Prometheus, and ArgoCD for their daily tech needs. It is important to recognize that CNCF projects thrive on human contributors in order to keep them going.

Many longtime software developers have spent years working with closed-source tooling and have had limited exposure to open source software (OSS). As their companies embarked on a cloud native transformation they were suddenly exposed to the vibrant community around CNCF OSS projects, including easy access to project maintainers.

While focus on recruiting open source contributors often centers on entry-level engineers and non-coders, it's important to consider experienced engineers who adopted Cloud Native technologies later in their careers.

Demystifying Storage in Kubernetes,"Demystifying Storage in Kubernetes
=============================

A founding fact of Kubernetes is rooted in running stateless, scale-out, lightweight containers, believe it or not, almost 9 years after going open source, such workloads form a good majority in any cloud native ecosystem, what about stateful ones? Nah, we will rather use VMs, Kubernetes storage, just way too complex and often fragile. That's what we hear even from seasoned pros.

Honestly, not their fault either, container and Kubernetes native storage has been on an evolution path but all signs have looked promising, running stateful applications such as databases is a now a reality for many enterprises who embraced cloud native. Kubernetes from it's really early versions have supported many constructs to bring persistent storage as a first class citizen, built-in and not bolt-on as they say. In-tree volumes, PersistentVolume, PersistentVolumeClaim, StorageClass are some of the native Kubernetes ""kinds"" which you have probably heard and used both, then came along the game changer, the Container Storage Interface specification (CSI), which unlocked the storage innovation and allowed experts in this field to independently improve the state of storage in Kubernetes.

Today, we see projects like Long Horn, Open EBS, Rook and many commercially provided & supported solutions pioneering in this space, yes storage remains a relatively harder aspect of managing Kubernetes native workloads but it's not a novelty anymore, thanks to CSI spec, which drove Kubernetes adoption for running even mission critical databases. While all of it sounds a lot to chew upon, once you get your fundamentals correct, nothing seems impossible!

In this talk, we will start at a very fundamental level of understanding container storage in general and scale our way up to how Kubernetes deals with storage needs of your workloads, what is CSI and how it works, we will finish the talk with a live demo on running stateful application (a database) in a K8 cluster which uses an open source CSI provider to meet the storage demands.

Synergizing Threat-Informed Defense: When Cloud Attack Emulation Meets Detection Engineering,"Cloud Detection and Resposne (CDR) is an evolving approach to proactively defending cloud infrastructure against cyber-attacks. CDR takes a lot of approaches from traditional Threat Detection and Incident Response (TDIR) and applies these approaches to cloud-native infrastructure. This approach allows for optimized strategies specifically designed to fit the cloud-native threat landscape, given the limitations of traditional TDIR in cloud-native infrastructure.


CDR strategies combine cloud threat detection and incident response by employing several techniques, including active monitoring, log analytics, threat intelligence, incident response, forensic analysis, and threat analysis. This is advantageous since security teams are enabled to be agile and more productive; hence, CDRs are rapidly becoming essential tools for security teams focused on protecting cloud-native infrastructure, including detection engineers, cloud security engineers, cloud incident responders, and SOC teams.
However, enabling efficient CDR strategies is challenging for several reasons, including cloud complexities, insufficient expertise, and cloud misconfiguration. These challenges often lead to blindspots; some cloud attacks are undetected, leading to successful compromises. Furthermore, the ephemerality of cloud resources requires continuous assessment, validation, and configuration of CDR to align with the evolving threat landscape. This level of security validation is challenging for most teams, and there are hardly solutions that can be easily leveraged.
Cloud Attack Emulation is an evolving approach to cyber security that employs empirical evaluation of security controls to gain evidence about their effectiveness via quick feedback loops proactively. These feedback loops, a core of system thinking, allow for quick analysis and adaption of security systems to stay ahead of cyber attacks. Detection engineers can easily leverage cloud attack emulation to enhance detection logic's accuracy and efficiency by emulating real attacks for testing. These cloud attacks are aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, thus allowing organizations to be Threat-Informed while reducing alert fatigue.

Hono: Multi-Runtime Web Framework for the Edges,"Today, choosing a serverless provider often creates vendor lock-in as JavaScript runtimes differ in their APIs and their availability. Same thing applies to regular JavaScript runtimes: you can't just execute your Node.js code in Deno, for example.

Here is where Hono comes in, a new TypeScript web framework based on latest web standards: it can run on the edges and in usual runtimes like Node.js, Deno and Bun. This allows your project not only to be easily and quickly migrated between AWS Lambda and Cloudflare Workers, for example, without any code modifications, but also from serverless providers to the server clouds and vice versa.

This is made possible by recent major developments in platform and framework interoperability. Companies like Cloudflare, Deno, Vercel and many others formed WinterCG, a community group focusing on interoperability of web APIs. Today, JavaScript Web Standard APIs include Request and Response objects, which can be used not only in fetch() for fetching resources, but also in web frameworks for defining API logic.
