yes,,Kenneth DuMez,Developer Relations Engineer,Teleport,,,,Why you should never use static shared secrets in GitHub Actions,"This talk will focus on the existing vulnerabilities and downsides of using shared encrypted secrets to access key pieces of infrastructure programmatically using GitHub Actions and how you can greatly improve the security of your GitHub workflows. As GitHub Actions has matured as a product and more and more companies rely on it for their CI/CD workflows, an exposed secret in the repository can be the difference between a team being able to efficiently test/deploy code, and an infrastructure penetration nightmare. Allow your devops engineering team to sleep easier at night by replacing GitHub secret management with Teleport machineID, allowing your GitHub Actions workflow to manage infrastructure resources like Kubernetes clusters, databases and more, all without having to rely on shared secrets stored in your repository.
The talk will include an overview of existing vulnerabilities, how Teleport MachineID rethinks automated infrastructure access, as well as a demo showing how you can control your Kubernetes clusters using GHA workflows without secrets while keeping a full audit trail and control of your workflow. Leave shared secrets behind in 2022 and enter the new year with Teleport MachineID, giving you, your engineers, and customers peace of mind.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-dumez-086b84220/,,,,,devops_kenneth_dumez.png,https://youtu.be/R8Y-dvN9enw,"static,shared,secrets,github,actions",devops_kenneth_dumez.txt,15

no,tools,Gianluca Mardente,Principal Engineer,Cisco Systems,,,,Manage Kubernetes addons for multiple cluster using runtime state,"Kubernetes itself is not a complete solution. To build a production cluster, various additional addons like CNI or CoreDNS are needed. There are some solutions already. But if:
1. N Kubernetes clusters need to be managed;
2. the configuration has to change automatically when clusters runtime state changes;
we feel a new declarative solution is needed.
Given above requirements, Sveltos wants to figure out the best way to install, manage and deliver cluster addons. The idea is simple:
1. have one management cluster from where all managed clusters can be reached;
1. from the management cluster, selects one or more clusters with a Kubernetes label selector;
2. lists which Kubernetes addons need to be deployed on such clusters.
Then have a controller that automatically detects new clusters and react to configuration changes and bring cluster states to match the desired states
.
![Sveltos ClusterProfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/sveltos-manager/main/doc/sveltos.png)
This solution needs to be able to fetch information from the management cluster. For instance, when deploying calico, pod cidrs might have to be provided. Which pod cidrs has to be used in which cluster, is usually an information present in the management cluster (in a management cluster with ClusterAPI, such information is present in the corresponding Cluster instance, in the Spec section). ![Fetch information from management cluster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/.github/main/docs/sveltos_calico.png)
So far, such solution still requires user to manage cluster labels. Ideally, which labels need to be attached to a cluster should be automatically detected by looking at cluster runtime state. This is especially true for long lived clusters.
Let's considered a very simple scenario. A set of addons (with a specific versions) are deployed in any production cluster running kubernetes version v1.24.x. When any of those clusters is upgraded to a Kubernetes version v1.25.x, a new set of addons (maybe just different versions) needs to be deployed. Instead of requiring user to change cluster labels when clusters are upgraded (which is error prone very easy to forget), we introduced a new concept: Sveltos Classifier.
Using Classifier users can classify clusters based on:
1. Kubernetes version
2. Kubernetes resources
and can define set of labels a matching cluster should have.
Using a combination of ClusterProfile and Classifier, we can have Sveltos: 1. automatically detects cluster runtime state and updates cluster labels;
- deploys new set of addons as soon as cluster is upgraded and its runtime state changes (because its labels have been updated by Sveltos as consequence of #1).
![Sveltos Classifier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/demos/main/classifier/classifier.gif)
When deploying N addons in M clusters, an emphasis need to be on visibility. When making a change it must be clear what effects are going to be (which clusters are going to be impacted and how).
So sveltos can be set in DryRun mode. While in DryRun mode, we can make any change and nothing will be propagated to managed cluster. Rather when done, we can use sveltos to see what would happen because of our changes and where (which clusters). Sveltos will create a summary table listing:
- which helm charts will be deployed/deleted;
- which helm charts will be upgraded (from which version to which version);
- which kubernetes resources will be updated.
After reviewing if fine with the change, Sveltos can be switched back to continuous mode and only then it will propagated changes to managed cluster.
Sveltos also supports taking snapshots and rollback of the configuration.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianlucamardente/,@projectsveltos,,,Conf42 DevOps 2023 - Gianluca Mardente.pdf,devops_gianluca_mardente.png,https://youtu.be/Xi2HvRfaNYI,"kubernetes,addons,multiple,cluster,runtime,state",devops_gianluca_mardente.txt,

Tracking a request's flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind.
Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible.

no,tools,Shubham Srivastava,Leading Developer Relations,Zenduty,,,,Observability of Microservices using Open Source Solutions,"Observability is the ability to measure the internal states of a system by examining its outputs. Observability is about bringing visibility into a system - turning the lights on, to see and understand the state of each component of the system, with context to aid with debugging and performance tuning. In essence, it’s a method for learning about what you don’t know from what you do know. Today’s cloud-native applications must be developed with observability at the core of their design. **Observability is no longer a 'neat' practice that only superstar engineering teams incorporate but a clear day 1 developer concern.**
Finding tooling that helps you bridge the correlation between logs, metrics and traces into a perfect concoction is crucial, thus building an efficient observability system might seem like a daunting and expensive task to many teams only recently venturing into the world of reliability. However, setting up a Day 1 observability structure can be much simpler than anticipated with the right insights and tooling, and can even be achieved solely with Open Source Solutions. **In this talk, I'll aim to acquaint the listeners to how observability is being achieved in organisations of different scales and how they can establish an efficient microservice observability system using just open source tools.**",https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham67,@shhhhubham,,,Conf42 DevOps 2023 - Shubham Srivastava.pdf,devops_shubham_srivastava.png,https://youtu.be/n9Q-LONGcec,"observability,microservices,open,source",devops_shubham_srivastava.txt,

no,deep dive,Michele Dodic,SRE DevOps Specialist,Accenture,Francesco Sbaraglia,SRE Tech Lead ASG,Accenture,AI-driven DevOps CI/CD pipelines,"Ensuring reliability within deployment pipelines for complex systems dealing with massive flows of real-time data can be a challenge. However, by enabling Observability across our E2E infrastructure and combining AI techniques with SRE best practices, we can successfully prevent faulty deployments.
Everyone knows that automation testing is at the core of any DevOps pipeline in order to enable an early detection of CI/CD platform overload. However, this does not apply to large systems dealing with massive flows of real-time data, where failures are often extremely hard to identify due to the infrastructure's complexity – especially in multi-hybrid cloud environments.
Imagine this: you’re a DevOps Engineer at a major tech giant and you are responsible for the overall system health, which is running in prod. Numerous alerts, server crashes, Jira tickets, incidents and an avalanche of responsibilities, which sometimes simply feel like a ticking time bomb. Furthermore, your production environment is constantly being updated with various deployments of new code. While automated tests in CI/CD pipelines make sure that the new code is functioning, these do not cover all the dark corners of your end-to-end deployment platform. Imagine, for instance, that the building/testing/deployment service of your CI/CD platform is experiencing performance issues (or worse) at the same exact time when you are deploying a brand new feature into live code. How do we prevent a disaster? And what if we are in rush for a hot-fix?
The first step is to establish observability, which focuses on enabling full-stack visibility of your environment. This enables end-to-end insights, which provide transparency of all your internal components and help you understand how these interact with each other, as well as how they affect the overall systems. Unlike traditional monitoring approaches, the aim is to understand why something is broken, instead of merely focusing on what is broken. Ideally, we want to shift the paradigm from reactive to predictive.
Once observability has been enabled across our end-to-end environment, we will employ AI/ML techniques in order to pre-emptively alert, as well as prevent any form of system degradation. We combine these strategies mentioned so far with SRE methodologies (e.g. SLO, error budget) when measuring our system's overall health. This type of approach provides an additional layer of reliability to DevOps pipelines.

In this talk, Antoni will go over how to adopt the best DevOps practices in the space of data engineering. And the challenges in adopting them considering the different skill sets of the data engineers and the various needs.
- What is the API for Data?
- What types of SLOs and SLAs do data engineers need to track?
- How do we adapt and automate the DevOps cycle - plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, and monitor data?
Those are challenging questions, and the data engineering space does not have a good answer yet.

no,lessons learned,Frank Kilcommins,API Technical Evangelist,SmartBear,,,,Let's Make a Pact - Don't Break my API!,"In this talk, I’ll introduce bi-directional contract testing, which empowers teams scale fast by leveraging existing artifacts, such as OpenAPI, and tooling investments to understand what’s breaking, what’s not, and when a break is a good choice! Let microservices be everywhere with confidence!
60+% of organizations cite microservices as a leading driver for API growth in the next 2 years. Teams continue to break down monolithic systems, seeking to capitalize on the advantages of decoupled capabilities - reduced costs, reduced TTM, faster releases, decentralized evolvability. Such benefits don't linearly scale! Managing the API sprawl is out weighting the benefits for many!
Even with the solid extensibility design, governance workflows and high levels of automation, all of which leveraging OpenAPI and other leading specifications, it can be difficult to know what constitutes a breaking change to an API.
What's the impact?
Teams providing APIs lose sight of who their consumers are. Consumers lose track of what surface area of APIs they are using. In fact, any observable change in the behavior of an API will be deemed breaking by certain consumers (Hyrum’s Law).
Can it be addressed?
Contact testing with Pact, empowers providers and consumers to determine the impact of any change from their IDE. It addresses the coordination & communication challenges associated with delivering distributed systems. Thus calming the chaos caused by the microservices sprawl.
Bi-directional contract testing capabilities in Pactflow, hits the sweet spot with design-first flows. Using provider-driven contract testing, developers can quickly scale by leveraging existing OpenAPI documentation investments to create tests reusing the same OpenAPI artifacts. One contract and lots of Pacts with your consumers!

Many think this just means to store your Infrastructure-as-Code in Git, then have pipeline run the code, but it is actually much more complicated than that. True GitOps takes the deployment out of CI/CD, and the most popular solutions are using Kubernetes controllers to do all the heavy lifting.
So if we can't just store our HCL files in a repository and have that trigger a pipeline, how can we use Terraform in a true GitOps fashion?

The tech industry went from the IT to DevOps, and now we are in the era of Platform Engineering teams. They are to create company-specific platform to develop and deliver their products.
It requires a special abstraction level on top of Cloud provider (AWS, Azure etc.) and tooling (K8S, Terraform..), including specific app types (Express, Spring Boot, Flask etc.) and CI/CD pipelines (GitLab, Github) + observability and security enablement, to move the cognitive load from the product delivery teams.

Everyone in the industry seems to be talking about DevOps these days and how it makes teams more self-sufficient and agile. But in a rushed attempt to implement DevOps practices in their organizations, people often end up making things harder for both developers and ops people. Striking a balance and keeping both sides happy is crucial to the success of businesses. This talk will go over the common things people get wrong when implementing DevOps and show how they can be detrimental to the productivity of teams. After analyzing these problems, we will look at ways to rethink the implementation of DevOps by doing things in a way that makes both developers and ops people happy and self-sufficient.

It is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era. The holy grail for platform engineering today is to achieve the most effective “Internal Developer Platform” (IDP) that enables the rest of the developers in the company to be as effective as possible. Can this job be accomplished with engineering skills alone?
Platform intersects with product in two ways: first, the platform must be optimized for supporting the development of the company-specific product. Second, the platform has to be built with a product mindset and practices for it to be adopted by its users - the developers. In this session, we will discuss how to build an engineering platform that your engineers will actually want to use. We will go over standard product practices to use when creating the developer platform, and also the importance of making sure your IDP actually helps developers build the company’s products faster and better. We will define the role of the platform product manager (PPM), and the importance he plays in ensuring our platform is not a glorified Rube Goldberg machine.
In this session you will learn:
- What is platform engineering? Is it just a new name for DevOps?
- What makes an IDP and a platform team successful?
- Who is the PPM? why is he important? How do I convince my head of product we need one?

What about the remaining on-premise deployments? Edge? And what the heck is fog? Head spinning already? Good. We might just have a solution for you: a meta operating system approach to the cloud-fog-edge computing continuum.
In this talk, I wish to present a novel, meta operating system approach to the cloud-fog-edge computing continuum as approached by the NebulOus project. NebulOus aims to accomplish substantial research contributions in the realms of cloud, fog and edge computing brokerage by introducing advanced methods and tools for enabling secure and optimal application provisioning and reconfiguration over the cloud computing continuum.
NebulOus will develop a novel Meta Operating System (MOS) and platform that seamlessly exploits edge and fog nodes, in conjunction with multi-cloud resources, to cope with the requirements posed by low latency applications.
NebulOus will offer the produced software under an open-source licence: Mozilla Public Licence 2.0.
The envisaged solution includes the following directions of work:
* Development of appropriate modelling methods and tools for describing the cloud-fog-edge computing continuum, application requirements, and data streams; these methods and tools will be used for assuring the QoS of the provisioned services.
* Efficient comparison of available offerings, using appropriate multi-criteria decision-making methods that are able to consider all dimensions of consumer requirements.
* Addressing the security aspects emerging in the cloud-fog-edge computing continuum.
* Conducting and monitoring smart contracts-based service level agreements.

After all, you have always been told and likely witnessed how this type of coupling can add a lot of friction to a world that is built for high velocity. But I'm also willing to bet you have experienced the opposite side effects of dealing with dozens of services that have had the same chunks of code copied and pasted over and over again, and now you need to make a standardized, simple header change to all services across your platform; talk about tedious, frictional, error-prone work that you probably will not do! Using a variety of code-sharing processes and techniques like inner sourcing, module design, automated updates, and service templates, reusing code in your organization can be built as an asset rather than a liability.
In this talk, we will explore the architectural myth in microservices that you should NEVER share any code and explore the dos and don'ts of the types of reuse that you want to achieve through appropriate coupling. We will examine effective reuse patterns, including what a Service Template architecture looks like, while also spending time on the lifecycle of shared code and practically rolling it out to your services.
