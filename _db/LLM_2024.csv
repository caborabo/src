RAG for a medical company: the technical and product challenges,"[RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)] is the process of querying a (large) set of documents with natural language, leveraging vector search and llms. This talk will focus on learnings from building a RAG for a **medical company**, to allow doctors to query drug documentation with natural language, using tools like **[Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/get-started/overview), [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) and [Langsmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)**.
Naturally, a product question emerged: how to effectively leverage LLMs that **can never guarantee 100% accuracy** in the health sector?
Furthermore, while many open-source tools, such as Langchain, enable the creation of such pipelines in just [few lines of code](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/cookbook/retrieval), without specific adjustments, such systems often do **not** perform well enough to gain **user adoption**.

In this talk, we will cover the challenges and learnings encountered while building a **RAG for the drug documentation of a medical company**. More specifically, we will:

- Cover the **basics** of RAGs.
- Present the use case we faced and showcase the **resulting product**.
- Show how we significantly improved our **retrieval and generation metrics** with techniques such as leveraging **LLMs** to add extra context to the user's question to enhance retrieval accuracy.
- Discuss how we designed the product to effectively utilize LLMs while ensuring that doctors are not **misled** by potentially erroneous information, such as **hallucinations**. We achieved this mostly by displaying the sources: while many RAG pipelines cite their sources, we went a step further by **inserting HTMLs** of the sources directly **within** the generated answers, along with **highlighted citations**.
- Highlight the tooling aspect of the project, e.g. **[Langsmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) (a logging tool for LLMs)**, allowed us to easily augment our initial dataset and ensure that users were interacting correctly with the product. Furthermore, the ability to replay/alter a prompt on the interface allowed the **product owner** to iterate on prompt engineering and assist with technical iterations using their **field knowledge**.",Noé Achache,,https://www.sicara.fr/en/noe-achache
Make your LLM app sane again: forgetting incorrect data in real time.,"Thanks to LLMs and Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), building a chatbot that answers questions about your own internal documentation is child's play. RAG extends the knowledge of the LLM by adding the relevant documents, dubbed the context, in the prompt. However, if your data contains outdated information or fake news, your results will be compromised too.
Fortunately, the context is lost at the end of the conversation: removing incorrect data from the documentation makes the LLM forget about it in future conversations. The challenge is maintaining a document index in real time to retrieve only up-to-date information.
In this talk, you will learn how to create an LLM-powered chatbot in Python from scratch with an always up-to-date RAG mechanism. The chatbot will answer questions about your own documents, updating in real-time its knowledge alongside the changes in the documentation.",Olivier Ruas,,

Advanced API Design for Scalable and Fault-Tolerant Data-Intensive Distributed Systems,"This proposal delves into RESTful principles, asynchronous operations, security considerations, techniques for optimizing data retrieval through pagination and filtering, exploration of caching and rate limiting, importance of idempotent operations and error handling in maintaining data consistency and facilitating seamless integration with evolving systems.


Learning objectives:

This topic aims to provide practical insights and guidelines for modern software engineers, architects, and developers involved in the creation and evolution of APIs for data-intensive distributed systems. By adopting the proposed advanced API design principles, organizations can achieve a balance between scalability, performance optimization and fault tolerance, ultimately contributing to the success of their distributed computing initiatives.


Advanced API Design:

1. RESTful Principles:
RESTful principles form the foundation of well-structured APIs, emphasizing stateless communication, resource-oriented design, and standard HTTP methods.
Adhering to RESTful principles ensures a standardized, scalable, and easily maintainable API architecture. It facilitates clear communication between clients and servers, promoting a consistent and predictable user experience.

2. Asynchronous Operations with Webhooks:
Asynchronous operations allow decoupling of processing tasks from the main application flow, while webhooks enable real-time communication by pushing data to subscribed servers when specific events occur.
By incorporating asynchronous operations and webhooks, APIs can handle time-consuming tasks efficiently, minimize latency, and provide real-time updates. This contributes to improved responsiveness and scalability, particularly in systems with fluctuating workloads.

3. Security:
Authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, API keys), authorization strategies, data encryption (HTTPS), and protection against common security threats.
Security measures are paramount to safeguard data integrity, confidentiality, and prevent unauthorized access or malicious attacks. Robust security practices instill trust in the API and protect sensitive information from potential breaches.

4. Pagination and Filtering:
Pagination involves breaking down large result sets into manageable pages, while filtering allows clients to request specific data based on criteria.
Pagination and filtering optimize data retrieval, reduce bandwidth consumption, and enhance API performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. This ensures efficient use of resources and minimizes response times.

5. Caching:
Caching involves storing copies of frequently accessed data to reduce redundant computations or database queries.
Caching enhances API performance by minimizing the need for repeated data retrieval. It reduces latency and conserves resources, making it particularly beneficial for read-heavy operations and improving overall system responsiveness.

6. Rate Limiting:
Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a client can make within a specified time period.
Rate limiting prevents abuse, ensures fair resource usage, and protects the API from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. It promotes stability, reliability, and fair access to resources.

7. Idempotent Operations:
Idempotent operations produce the same result regardless of how many times they are executed.
Idempotence ensures consistency in the face of network issues or retries. It reduces the risk of unintended consequences, making operations more predictable and resilient.

8. Error Handling and Resilience:
Clear, standardized error responses, along with mechanisms for graceful error handling and recovery.
Effective error handling and resilience mechanisms contribute to the overall reliability of the API. Well-designed error responses enable clients to understand and respond appropriately to unexpected situations, while resilience ensures continued functionality despite failures.",Santosh Nikhil Kumar,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/santoshadireddy/
