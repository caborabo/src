,a keynote,Alayshia Knighten,,,Freelance,Alayshia Knighten.png,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alayshia/,,,,Keynote: Supercharging Observability with Feature Flagging,"Feature flags allow you to enable and disable code without changing or deploying any source code, as well as letting you selectively route traffic to certain users or a percentage of certain users, along with other great tricks. It’s powerful stuff … but when you combine it with observability (the ability to understand the inner workings of your complex systems and other unknown-unknowns), what you get is a supercharged, superpowered version of both.
With observability and feature flags, you and your teams get deep technical and business insights in real time about how your code is working, what changed with your last deploy, and how changes are impacting different users, apps, or groups.",,
