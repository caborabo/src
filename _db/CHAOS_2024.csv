,no,ai,Francesco Sbaraglia,SRE Tech lead ASG,Accenture,Michele Dodic,SRE Associate Manager,Accenture,Chaos Engineering in the Fast Lane: Accelerating Resilience with AI and eBPF,"The rapidly growing complexity of distributed services and continuously evolving micro-service architectures currently affect individuals and organizations on every level. These phenomena, in turn, result in an ever-increasing amount of time-to-detect and time-to-resolve potential issues. Despite continuous and increasing investments in automation and security, the challenge remains with SRE and DevSecOps teams struggling to uncover and patch weak spots. While traditional, infrastructure-based chaos experiments only begin to scratch the surface of this challenge, Chaos Engineering powered by AI digs deeper.
In this session, we will provide a detailed walkthrough on how to ideate, plan, implement, and run chaos experiments. To achieve better context-awareness on a more cloud-native level, we will apply an evolving piece of technology called eBPF, which makes the kernel programmable. On top of that, we will demonstrate how the integration of GenAI can help us evaluate the magnitude of the impact of the chaos experiment. All of that will be exemplified in a live demo, featuring a CI/CD DevSecOps deployment pipeline instrumented with eBPF, as well as integrated with OpenAI and observability tooling.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/fsbaraglia/,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michele-dodic/,,Francesco Sbaraglia & Michele Dodic - Conf42 Chaos Engineering 2024.pdf,Francesco Sbaraglia & Michele Dodic_chaos.png,https://youtu.be/VcTYEkCL8aE,"accelerating,resilience,ebpf",
