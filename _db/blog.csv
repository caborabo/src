,The Impact of Quantum Computing on Cybersecurity: Threats and Opportunities,guest post by Myrtle Bautista,2023-06-15,2023-06-15-impact-quantum-computing-cybersecurity-myrtle-bautista,./assets/splash/BLOG_15062023.png,"## Quantum computing has taken the world of IT security by storm with its revolutionary new capabilities.

Using quantum-level calculations promises to revolutionize how we secure data and protect ourselves from cyber threats. But what is quantum computing? What are the potential risks and opportunities it offers for cybersecurity?

In this blog post, we'll explore the potential implications of quantum computing for our online safety, analyzing both threats and possibilities that could arise due to technological advances.

## Opportunities of Quantum Computing on Cybersecurity

### Improvement of Encryption Algorithms

Quantum computing offers a unique solution for encrypting valuable data. By harnessing the power of quantum algorithms and advances in mathematics, it is possible to protect data with higher levels of security than ever before.

While traditional encryption tools provide a certain level of protection, they can be rendered useless by sophisticated computer attacks and hackers. However, using quantum computing to improve existing encryption algorithms can protect data against even the most powerful forms of attack.

### Identification of Malicious Codes

[Quantum computing](https://www.conf42.com/2022-06-29-quantum-world-2022) is an exciting new technology that can revolutionize how malicious code is identified and removed from computers. By utilizing the laws of quantum mechanics, this technology allows thousands of calculations to be done simultaneously, far outpacing conventional computing power.

Using quantum-based algorithms, malicious code can be analyzed more quickly and accurately than ever before, potentially helping to curb the spread of dangerous viruses and malware.

This could make our online world safer and open up many possibilities for making faster breakthroughs in other areas, such as machine learning and data analysis.

### Analyzing Large Data Sets

This powerful technology combines principles of quantum mechanics with modern computing to enable us to tackle problems that would be difficult, or even impossible, for classical computers.

By taking advantage of the unique properties of quantum physics, a single quantum computer can analyze massive amounts of data far more effectively and efficiently than traditional technologies.

### Use in Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms

Quantum computers have been touted as the future of computing, capable of performing calculations that traditional computers could not possibly manage. However, these quantum machines are also being developed with another application in mind -- quantum machine learning algorithms.

This means using quantum computers to improve artificial intelligence, allowing for smarter and more robust AI systems. The potential for this technology is immense, with many experts expecting it to revolutionize [machine learning](https://www.conf42.com/2022-05-18-machine-learning-stronger-than-ever) in the same way quantum computing will revolutionize computing itself.

### Creating More Efficient and Secure Algorithms for Authentication

Quantum computing makes possible the creation of more powerful algorithms that promise to revolutionize authentication processes. With its ability to store and process large amounts of data, quantum computing can generate stronger cryptographic keys, providing an unprecedented level of security for authenticating users.

In addition, quantum computing algorithms can help reduce authentication times to nearly instantaneous levels due to their capacity to process big datasets quickly. Thus, leveraging quantum computing enables developers to create more efficient and secure algorithms for accurately authenticating individuals in record time.

Developers must also engage in continuous security monitoring, which could lead to an entirely new horizon regarding digital security and privacy within many industries - from financial services to healthcare and transportation.

## Threats Posed by Quantum Computing on Cybersecurity

### Breaking Through Traditional Encryption Methods

Cybercriminals have a whole new tool at their disposal which is quantum computers. These ultra-powerful machines can easily crack through traditional encryption methods, making the valuable data stored in such systems vulnerable to attack.

It's like having a master key that can open any door on earth. The rewards for bad actors could be immense, so companies must update their security measures to cope with this new technology to ensure the safety of their information and customers.

Thankfully, the development of protection mechanisms is advancing right alongside quantum computing, so let's hope these criminal masterminds aren't able to exploit the situation before these safeguards are in place.

### DNNs Will Be More Difficult to Evaluate

Recent advances in quantum computing have led to concerning implications for cybersecurity, especially with regard to the defense mechanisms used by businesses. A further issue is posed by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are already a difficult security component to evaluate.

With quantum computing powering the computational models of these DNNs, their evaluation will become more difficult, as it may be impossible to determine all possible outcomes of a complex network.

Businesses looking to safeguard their data should now have comprehensive defenses that use up-to-date security evaluations and components to defend against increasingly powerful hacker networks.

### Web Interactions Will Be At Risk

As quantum computers become stronger and more efficient, it will undoubtedly be challenging as web interactions become increasingly vulnerable to intrusive quantum computing attacks.

The most pressing worry is that when conventional security measures are overpowered by quantum computing power, our most sensitive data will be at risk, especially because so much of our lives now transpire online.

Suppose a quantum computer goes rogue and hacks our banking information, social media accounts - or even worse - national secrets. In that case, it will take an even higher level of tech-savviness to protect us from harm in the new age of cybersecurity risks.

## Conclusion

As quantum computing matures and gains traction, it will likely have a major impact on cybersecurity, positively and negatively. It could be used to improve the security of digital systems or even assist with encryption in unprecedented ways. Yet, it threatens to provide malicious actors with new means of bypassing existing cyber defenses.

Regardless, businesses must be vigilant about preparing for these changes to ensure their systems remain safe from intrusion and disruption.

,Cloudsmith: 10 ways to make your software pipeline more observable,"Manage All Of Your Artifact Repositories, in the Cloud",2022-11-21,2022-11-21-cloudsmith-devsecops-sponsor-announcement,./assets/splash/BLOG_Cloudsmith_DSO_2022.png,"#### Security into your software supply chain means visibility into how an artifact is built, packaged and signed.

A considerable part of the reason supply chain attacks are such a threat is that we are missing information to decide if the software we develop and use is safe.

Audit logs, SBOMs, automation, and package management are all essential aspects to bring visibility into your software supply chain so you can answer questions like:

- What are my build steps?
- Who wrote the code, who built that code, and who approved the code?
- What 3rd party dependencies do I use in my software, how trustworthy are they, and am I up to date?
- How do I trace my build from source to deployment?
- What vulnerabilities are in my code?

More than inspecting, scanning, and monitoring historical data, this information can be ingested by observability tools that can help you gain insights, identify unusual behavior and possibly prevent a software supply chain attack.

I've listed 10 ways to make your software pipelines more transparent and generate the information needed to gain your observability insights:

**1 Automated Build Steps**

Automate your builds using a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, CircleCI, or BuildKite. Make sure all the other tools you use in your build process, including your package repositories, tests and code scanners, facilitate automation using APIs, CLIs, and webhooks.

Having your build steps codified with no manual steps means they can be logged with timing and authentication information. You can gather unusual login attempts, policy changes, or build patterns. Using in-toto attestations at each build step can make this information verifiable and thus more trustworthy.

**2 Audit Logs**

Audit logs capture all actions the system, users, and service accounts perform for compliance and troubleshooting purposes.

All your build tools should produce audit logs, including your CI/CD, packaging, deployment, and cloud infrastructure tools.

Audit logs can be forwarded to the Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) for visibility, tracking, and managing of security incidents. SIEM tools also provide next-generation detection, analytics, and response.

**3 Package Management**

It's much more difficult for people and scanners to figure out what is installed on a system when software is installed using scripts instead of a package manager.

A software package, artifact, or image is the output of building software- it groups files containing your software along with the metadata about the software and dependencies in a well-defined format.

A package manager is a software tool that uses the power of automation to create, upload, install, upgrade, and configure software packages. Most software languages, containers, or operating systems have a corresponding package manager, e.g., NPM, NuGet, Maven, or RPM.

Dependencies installed with a package manager ensure consistency and transparency in how software is included in your product and give a straightforward way to access your package's metadata, including version information, license information, dependencies, environment state, etc.

Let's make it easy to figure out what is on our system by installing software with a package manager.

**4 Versioning Software and Version Control**

Consistently versioning your software product releases, e.g., [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), lets you keep track of all the changes and progress you make. For consumers of your software, the version numbers should inform them of when it's imperative to update and if there are backward compatibility issues.

Mistakes in build can be a hassle, but if at all possible and avoid republishing your builds.

**5 Pin your builds**

For visibility into your supply chain, we need to know all the 3rd party dependencies in your software. Some package managers, such as pip and npm, do their best to resolve package information look-ups when explicit guidance isn't provided. This means that a different dependency can be included in your software depending on when you build it e.g. if a dependency has a new update.

If you pin your dependencies to an exact version in your manifest files, no matter when you build your code, the same top-level dependencies should be pulled in, making your build more transparent and consistent.

**6 Automated dependency updates**

You need to know when your dependencies have updates for visibility into your software build.

The previous step recommended pinning your builds, but if you have many dependencies, it can be very difficult to update each one manually.

Several update tools help you check for updates in your code base, including Renovate and Dependabot (GitHub).

**7 Scorecards**

[Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) is an automated tool that gives developers a score on how safe their dependencies are. Understanding the trustworthiness of your dependencies is vital to improving the security posture of your project.

**8 Sign your artifacts**

Signing a package/artifact/image lets people know that this package was signed by a person or organization and proves that the code was not tampered with after it was signed.

There are issues with signing, including a lack of understanding of the signing process, cost, complexity of managing keys, implementation of code signing pipelines, and the lack of verification of signatures.

Recent developments in signing to reduce the complexity of signing and remove the cost barrier to signing with the [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) project have invigorated efforts to sign artifacts.

**9 Generate SBOMs**

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) lists all the components in your software. The notion of the SBOM was popularized by the Whitehouse when it was namechecked in an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) last year on improving software security.

An accurate SBOM would improve the transparency of your supply chain, which could allow for:

- Earlier identification of potentially vulnerable systems
- Support informed decisions for 3rd party dependencies
- Incentivize secure software development practices.

[Tooling around generating an SBOM](https://cloudsmith.com/blog/how-to-generate-and-host-an-sbom/) is still evolving, but hopefully, it will be integrated into build tools, making this process accurate and automatable.

**10 Provenance of your built artifacts**

It is no longer just about the published artifact at the end of your software pipeline. Instead, it is about providing the tools to ensure artifact integrity across the supply chain.

Information demonstrating the supply chain provenance of a built artifact includes a combination of the steps above, including signing, build attestations, and SBOMs.

Provenance allows you to know and prove the origin of your software.

Monitor and Observe your Software Supply Chain

Some of this information isn't so easy to generate but will help us monitor and observe our software supply chain, which will ultimately help secure it. This information will help us:

- Monitor software supply chain more effectively
- Enable visibility for DevOps, security analysts, and developers into the entire build process
- Find and connect events in our build and trace them back to the source
- Detect and mitigate against vulnerabilities earlier
- Detect and alert for unusual login activity or build activities

Observability tools are promising to answer questions relating to the information that your system is generating, even questions that are not currently anticipated- what could this do for our software supply chain?

We've lived it just as you do: Incidents happen, despite the best plans and practices. They rarely go as imagined. Afterwards, a hapless engineer gets assigned to run a post-mortem meeting. The meeting isn't fully attended. The resulting report gets filed away where few will read it.

Our decades of combined experience in incident analysis at Jeli tell us that teams need mission-critical tools to adapt to continuously changing complex systems. That's why we give away a free IR Bot and offer a [free trial package](https://www.jeli.io/pricing) for small companies that includes our Narrative Builder, timelines, tags, investigator notes and multi-channel support. These are the very basics every company should have.

### We think big about the little things

Response teams are made of people, not machines and apps. We know, with cross discipline research backing us up, that people on distributed teams need an environment that supports them in ways that lead to better performance, more productivity, and much higher job satisfaction. These go together. We've baked that into our company culture and our product.

What creates that productive environment for learning and improving?

- **Make everyone feel safe sharing the truths:** Team members need _psychological safety_ — the certainty that they can do their jobs, speak necessary truths, and have potentially challenging conversations without repercussions. [Amy Edmondson](https://amycedmondson.com/) at Harvard Business School is a leading author on the topic with more than 20 years of research. Learning, she says, happens when high performance expectations and psychological safety are combined. She provides this helpful X/Y infographic that resonates with us.

- **Share**** findings effectively:** Burying a retrospective report doesn't lead to improved performance, increased productivity, or a healthier work environment. Our [Conf42 keynote](https://www.conf42.com/Incident_Management_2022_Vanessa_Huerta_Granda_sharing_Incident_findings_effectively) by Jeli Solutions Engineer Vanessa Huerta Granda will get to the nuts and bolts of how to ensure that your learnings from incidents reach the most people and have the deepest impact. (For starters: craft a short abstract as your incident's elevator pitch. Use it to get those who didn't attend the retro to decide to learn more about the incident and get behind your proposed solutions.) Vanessa has a lot more to share — don't miss her talk!

- **Learn across incidents over time:** We call it cross-incident analysis, or XIA, in our work. Jeli's tools are designed and built knowing that incidents don't live independently of one another. They're best viewed as a connected series of events to be analyzed as a whole. Seeing incidents as part of a connected whole helps you avoid fixing one thing by breaking another, identify organizational contributing factors (code freezes!), and develop a long-term big picture of how best to deploy your organization's talent and budget — over time, a series of minor issues can wreak unseen havoc on costs.

### We want to learn with you

No one person or group has more than a fraction of the knowledge, experience and insights we share as a group, often without knowing it. We're always eager to connect and learn with others.

,How to Make SPA Apps SEO Friendly,a guest blogpost by Sammy Lin,2022-08-04,2022-08-04-spa-apps-seo-friendly,./assets/splash/SPA_Apps_SEO_friendly.PNG,"## How to Make SPA Apps SEO Friendly
The evolution of web apps has recently brought about an interesting twist. As developers became ever more reliant on client-side Javascript for creating dynamic web pages, a new pattern of development emerged. This new pattern was great for developers and clients alike.
However, Googlebot wasn’t so fond of it. This client heavy pattern, known as the single page application (SPA), essentially builds and renders an entire website on the client. In most cases, the only real work happening on the server is client-side API calls for data retrieval.

### Why Are SPAs Bad for SEO?
SPAs and SEO don’t always play well together, and it’s common for poorly configured [SPA
SEO](https://www.ohmycrawl.com/spa-seo) to rank poorly with Google or other search
engines. To understand why, we need a quick refresher on how an SPA works. SPAs use an
empty shell pattern, which means that an empty HTML shell is sent to the client at initial page
load.

### What the Client Receives When They Request an SPA
When you request a page that utilizes the SPA pattern of development, you’ll receive something that looks like this:
```
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Example SPA Shell&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;root&#39;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=”/spa-script.js”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

After the initial page load, the **spa-script.js** script is ran, which populates the `root div` tag
with all the guts of the site. This means the navigation bar, footer, images, and everything else
isn’t rendered until the browser finishes processing this script.
It’s a simple concept that works well at first glance. However, Google wants content fast, and
the extra time it takes to process all that Javascript before the content is displayed hurts page
rank for a number of Google SEO web metrics.

### Ways to Load Content More Efficiently in an SPA to Enhance SEO
SPA frameworks like React have devised a number of ways to increase SEO performance while
leveraging all the benefits that come with the SPA pattern. These techniques can be broken
down into 3 main categories:

1. CDN caching and prerendering services.
2. Dynamic loading.
3. Isomorphic development.

These techniques are often used in conjunction with one another to increase SEO performance,
which usually has the added benefit of enhancing user experience.
Let’s take a closer look at each technique and how they solve our SEO woes.

#### CDN Caching and Pre-Rendering Services
One popular and fairly simple technique is to utilize caching services, which saves a pre-
rendered copy of our SPA that is ready for the client (and search engines) to consume. This
improves SEO because the Javascript is already processed into static content, which is readily
available for crawler consumption.
The workflow for this solution looks something like this:

1. The SPA website is built and launched.
2. A prerender service such as prerender.io is used to store and serve a static “prerendered” copy of the website.
3. This new endpoint is configured with a CDN such as Cloudflare to serve the content even faster.

For small sites that utilize content that doesn’t change frequently, such as a blog or small business page, this solution works great. However, this option comes with limitations that make it a poor choice for sites more dynamic in nature.

The prerender.io service will only render your page one to three times per day. So, if you have
content that is changing rapidly, such as an auction site or social media platform, three renders
a day isn’t even close to keeping up with the rapidly changing data.

#### Dynamic Loading of Components
Most SPA frameworks come equipped with some form of dynamic or “lazy” loading
functionality. Since React is the most popular SPA framework to-date, we’ll use it for our
example.

When using React, code is broken up into components. Each component usually consists of
some bit of code that is eventually rendered into pure HTML. The problem is, all these
components are indiscriminately packaged up into a code bundle that’s processed on the client.
Instead of loading all of this code as one linear chunk, we can gain significant SEO performance
gains if we prioritize the order in which our code is loaded.
As an example, we can load our navigation bar and footer first, then load the body content
once these two components are rendered. This helps boost an SEO metric called first contentful
paint (FCP), which is an important Google ranking factor.
Here’s an example of what this would look like in a simple React implementation:

```
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from &#39;react&#39;;
import Navbar from &#39;./Navbar&#39;;
import Footer from &#39;./Footer&#39;;
 const MainContent = lazy(() =&gt; import(&#39;./MainContent&#39;));
 const App = () =&gt; {
        
    return(
        &lt;&gt;
            &lt;NavBar/&gt;
            &lt;Suspense fallback = {&lt;div&gt;Content is loading...&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;
                &lt;MainContent/&gt;

            &lt;/Suspense&gt;
            &lt;Footer/&gt;
        &lt;/&gt;
    );
    
}
 export default App;

```
As can be seen in the above code, we are importing the `lazy` and `Suspense` components from
the React framework. We then wrap our `MainContent` component, telling React to __only
load__ this component once all other components on the page are finished rendering.
This is a simple technique often overlooked by novice React developers that can significantly
increase SEO performance in React apps.

### Isomorphic Development for Increasing SEO Performance

Isomorphic development is just a fancy way of saying “what can be done on the client can also be done on the server.” In the case of React, this means that we can utilize React code on the server. This opens the door for two patterns of development that can increase SEO performance; static site generation (SSG) and server side rendering (SSR). Each technique can be defined as follows:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: SSG is similar in concept to prerendering, but it is much more powerful. SSG is implemented by creating server code that renders all of your SPA code into pure HTML at build-time. This means the developer can code the entire site using a framework like React, then run a “build”, which essentially converts all that code into static HTML files which are then served from a hosting provider.
- **Server Side Rendering (SSR)**: SSR is similar to SSG because most of the work happens on the server. However, instead of everything being processed at build-time, it is processed at “run-time”, during each request that is made by the client. This means that when you request a page, the server converts all of the code into HTML on the fly, then sends the result to the client.

SSG is typically faster than SSR, but it comes with the same pitfalls as the prerendering option. Although SSG can handle more dynamic data than a prerendering service, you are still limited

by the number of builds your server can process before the overhead becomes too cumbersome. SSR is currently the most scalable solution because you can handle much of the rendering on the server real-time, while dictating which code you’d like to process on the client.

### Overview SPA Technology and SEO Implications

Leveraging SPA technology is beneficial for both the developer and end-user. For this reason, developers have worked hard to come up with solutions for the inherent SEO pitfalls of this design pattern.

The techniques mentioned in this article can be used to significantly increase SEO performance, while leveraging all the great features that come with SPA frameworks such as React. As usual, if the problem is understood, it can be overcome.

The SPA paradigm is here to stay. While it can be tricky understanding which implementation is best for you, the payoff is usually worth the hard work.

Cloudsmith is the only truly cloud-native platform for engineers looking to set up a secure, cloud-native artifact repository in 60 seconds. Cloudsmith offers 24/7 engineer support, 225 points of presence, support for 28+ formats, and is ISO 270001 certified.

We make universal artifact management simple, easy and secure. Ownership of how your software artifacts, containers, and packages are pulled in, stored, and distributed is vital. It's the central point everything should pass through, and going forwards, as supply chain attacks increase, every single opening in your supply chain is a vector for attack.

You need a single source of truth, for all software and dependencies, that isolates and protects your teams and customers from supply chain attacks.

**Verifying assets with Continuous Packaging**

From signature verification to Docker vulnerability scanning, Cloudsmith helps you continuously assess threats and prevent tampering or corruption of your software. Easily protect your customers by shipping clean software only. Using Continuous Packaging (CP), Cloudsmith offers the observability and control to ensure that your software is always verified, packaged, and ready to deliver.

**The Package Delivery Network for Distributors**

Cloudsmith's Package Delivery Network (PDN) was built specifically for software distribution at the edge. Use entitlement tokens to seamlessly sell and distribute your software while utilizing custom domains to increase trust and present your brand as the DNS endpoint for global delivery. Whether deploying, or shipping licensed software to your customers, our global Package Delivery Network (PDN) is optimized to ensure lightning-fast delivery.

**Repositories Built The Way You Want**

Cloudsmith's multi-format repositories allow you to create a repository structure that works for your unique teams and processes. No more repository-per-format used. Instead, you can have as many formats within a repo as you like - letting you create a repo per environment (dev, stage, production), project, or per format.
