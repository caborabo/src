No,ai,Alex Harris,Co-Founder & CEO,Adadot,,,,Strokes vs Keystrokes: Using Causal AI to help uncover the similarities between athletic and developer performance,"In most 90s movies the nerds and the jocks were depicted as polar opposites. In reality, however, these two groups of people have more in common than most. Lets take performance for example. Most would describe athletic performance as a more or less straight line showing improvement over time. Most devs would also argue that they are quite consistent with how effective their output is. Neither of these is true. Join us to see how software development can learn from sports and how data science is revolutionising both fields.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8Falex-harris-7652069/,,,,,Alex Harris_quantum.png,https://youtu.be/UE0kRWODmOQ,"strokes,keystrokes",

No,deep dive,Archit Srivastava,Senior Technical Consultant - Data Engineering,o9 Solutions,,,,Principium : Diving into the Quantum Hardware Ecosystem,"The most difficult part of any idea, and making it a reality, is the very effort of getting it started. With the Quantum Ecosystem getting exponentially interesting each day, new advancements being made in the early years of Quantum Computing, for any economy it is very much important to have a head start. With the session, we will dive into the concepts surrounding Quantum Hardware, what are the different architectures.
Different quantum architectures cater to different areas and problems that they can solve, and also they govern what type of quantum based approach a country can take commercially based on the availability of materials to build them. 'Principium', means 'The Beginning' in Latin is a talk, condensed on what is Quantum Hardware, what is the current ecosystem and landscape looking like, and how the future looks, potentially how different quantum hardware can govern which problem statements can be tackled, the dependencies of one nation to the other to sustainably build various quantum computers, how and where is India currently in the Global Quantum Landscape. We will also try to explore the potential ways in which different quantum architectures can be utilised to solve various different problems prevalent in astrophysics, finance & supply chain and how can the commercialization of quantum hardware might look for India.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/architsrivastava3115/,,,,,Archit Srivastava_quantum.png,https://youtu.be/BuZ85d0w58c,"principium,hardware,ecosystem",
