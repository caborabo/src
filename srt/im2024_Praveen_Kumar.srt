1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,240
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,810
My name is Praveen Kumar, and I'm
currently working as Director of Business

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,950
and Product Readiness with a large life
insurance company here in North America.

4
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:14,749
So my topic of discussion today is how
artificial intelligence and machine

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,189
learning are creating efficiencies and
creating a transformative impact in

6
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,290
predicting consumer behavior analysis
and also how the claims are efficiently

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,220
processed using this New latest UpToDate
technologies like AI and machine learning.

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,169
So without further delay, let's get
onto the agenda of our discussion.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,930
So moving on to the next slide.

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,040
As you can see here.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,999
We have quite some agenda to cover
today during our conference topic.

12
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,430
I would first start with providing
you guys some background on the

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,309
industry context and challenges we have
today in the life and energy space.

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,760
And then we will discuss the power of
AI and ML in claims processing, how the

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,859
latest technologies from AI are providing
and creating efficiencies in processing

16
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,619
of claims, and then we will also discuss
the impact on operational efficiency.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,070
And how A.

18
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,310
I.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,770
And M.

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,050
L.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,040
Are used in predicting the
customer behavior before or

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,930
after a policy is purchased.

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,859
We would then move on to talk
about the customer satisfaction

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,999
and some key benefits of machine
learning and artificial intelligence

25
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,429
in the life and energy space.

26
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,490
And to close the topic, we will also
discuss a few case studies and the road

27
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,950
map of artificial intelligence and A.

28
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
I.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,410
Adoption for different
life and energy companies.

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,160
So without further delay, let's
start with the industry context.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,090
So as you guys know, today,
we have three different areas

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,930
in the whole life and annuity
ecosystem, which are most critical.

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,970
One is the claims processing.

34
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,740
Secondly is the consumer
behavior or predictive analytics

35
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,180
used for consumer behavior.

36
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,150
The third is the cost of insurance, right?

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,350
So as you can see, claim is a
very important aspect of any

38
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,860
life and annuities value chain.

39
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,700
So the current claims process often
involves a lot of manual tasks and

40
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,199
there are multiple layers of review
before a claim is actually paid or,

41
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,649
a claim is already approved, right?

42
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:17,929
Once it is issued by the company and,
due to this lot of manual effort,

43
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,869
there are delays, there might be errors
because there's a lot of human, human,

44
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,819
factor involved in the processing
of claims, which would ultimately is

45
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:28,829
leading to customer dissatisfaction.

46
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,849
second topic, what we will be
discussing in detail is the

47
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,509
consumer behavior insights, right?

48
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,680
So the taste of consumer or, the choice of
consumer in selecting an insurance company

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,209
or a policy is quickly changing, right?

50
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:47,710
What they expect and what they don't
expect, what are their preferences, right?

51
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:52,195
All these are different, very
important data points for a particular

52
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:54,255
company to acquire a consumer.

53
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:57,625
And then the third topic is
the cost pressures, right?

54
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:03,215
So the cost of insurance is nothing
but the cost of a particular company

55
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:05,524
to acquire a consumer, right?

56
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,059
To issue a policy or to sell a policy.

57
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,820
to make sure that the admin costs are
in control And to make sure that all

58
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,840
the operation costs and overhead costs
are not, Burdening into the policy of

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,540
the consumer which is purchasing, right?

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,620
So to basically deal with these three
challenges We can, we want to use AI

61
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,800
and machine learning to understand
the behavior of the consumer.

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,510
In that way, we can reduce the
complexity in claims processing.

63
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,630
We can gather more consumer
insights and predict consumer

64
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,030
behavior much efficiently.

65
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,300
And we can also bring down
the cost of insurance.

66
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,020
So moving on to the next slide,
so what is the role of AI

67
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,800
and ML in claims processing?

68
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,110
So today, as you can see, most of the,
most of the claims processing work,

69
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,210
like documentation, getting, evidences,
Validating the information, all this is

70
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:58,770
actually done majority of the times using
a manual intervention from humans, right?

71
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,590
So what AI can do in
this particular process?

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,130
in this particular process, we
can actually automate the whole

73
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,410
process of receiving documentation,
extracting the documentation for

74
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,330
a particular claim, validate the
information, and route it for approval.

75
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:19,220
the whole process from claim receivable to
claim, approval can be automated using AI.

76
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,310
And what these, AI helps, because these
large machine learning, algorithms, right?

77
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:28,875
which actually worked behind the
scenes along with AI, they detect

78
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,745
different patterns, in claims data, to
see if there are any fraud cases, if

79
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:35,415
there are any inconsistencies, right?

80
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:39,065
and they would automatically flag
suspicious cases for human review.

81
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,390
So there is never a complete 100 percent
automation, but there is always a human

82
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,900
factor involved along with collaborative
AI, along with machine learning to make

83
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,090
sure that, we also identify and detect
fraud, predictive analytics, right?

84
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,710
So also the AI algorithms.

85
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,290
They predict claim outcomes based on the
historical data of a particular policy.

86
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,260
For example, if we issue a life
insurance policy for a particular

87
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,030
person who is in an age group
of, a senior age group, right?

88
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,040
So based on his historical medical
data, the AI or machine learning can

89
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,865
predict what kind of decision making
and improvements Can occur in the

90
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:21,035
processing of claims, once we receive
a claim with the insurance company.

91
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:25,735
So basically the AI and machine
learning are very playing a very key

92
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:30,025
important role in anomaly detection,
in predicting analytics and also

93
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,595
in automated document handling.

94
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:33,385
So let's move on to the next slide.

95
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:34,415
Okay.

96
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:37,745
So how does AI and machine
learning are creating impacts and

97
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:39,095
operational efficiency, right?

98
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:43,205
So they basically reduce manual
intervention, meaning wherever there

99
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:44,745
is a human factor involved, right?

100
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:48,595
Like data entry or document
classification and claim assessment.

101
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:51,195
All of this can be actually
automated using AI.

102
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:56,155
And by doing this, we actually
have benefits of getting few errors

103
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:57,955
and the processing is much faster.

104
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:03,085
And in a way, by implementation of
AI in the claims processing, the life

105
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:08,035
insurance and annuity companies can
save money, which they actually spend

106
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,985
on operations, which they actually
spend on different overhead cost

107
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:16,455
of, hiring people to do stuff like
document classification and data entry.

108
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:20,475
And this is actually leading to an overall
reduction in the cost of claims handling.

109
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:24,315
So basically, and it also
helps the companies to fight

110
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:25,835
against fraud mitigation, right?

111
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:29,995
Because AI's ability to detect
anomalies in real time means that

112
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:31,645
the fraud can be caught earlier.

113
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:36,705
So basically, as you can see on this
slide, we have three important key

114
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:41,165
benefits on operational processing of
any company by using AI, which is nothing

115
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:43,285
but it reduces manual intervention.

116
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:48,085
And it gives us cost savings and it
also helps us in, fighting with fraud

117
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:53,025
claims and, detect anomalies in real
time very much earlier in the process

118
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,975
than towards the end of the process.

119
00:06:57,135 --> 00:06:57,425
Okay.

120
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:00,075
AI and ML and consumer behavior analysis.

121
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:05,905
So how do we use AI to drive
and understand the nature

122
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:07,455
of consumer behavior, right?

123
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:11,625
So basically AI actually helps us
with three important factors, what

124
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,295
I call as pattern recognition.

125
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:15,885
Personalization and proactive engagement.

126
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:17,425
So what is pattern recognition?

127
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:20,785
So whenever there is a change
in consumer behavior, right?

128
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:25,075
So the data, there are different data
points because the AI processes, large

129
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:30,285
volumes of data, it will be easily
able to identify trends and what

130
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:33,695
kind of buying behavior and patterns
the consumer is shifting to, right?

131
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,630
And what are the different payment
patterns and product differences

132
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
the consumer is actually asking for.

133
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,160
So all these, the AI would be able
to leverage the information, existing

134
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,790
information and future information, and
create data points which will help us in

135
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,780
creating a pattern or a trend analysis.

136
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,940
In that way, we can clearly see that, this
is a consumer behavior trend from, Point A

137
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,530
in time to point B in time how the tastes
have changed and how the preferences

138
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,560
have changed towards, Purchasing of a
particular policy or towards purchasing a

139
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,025
particular product and then with the help
of these data points What we can do is, as

140
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:11,765
life insurance companies have these data
points for review and analysis, right?

141
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:15,585
And they should be able to personalize
the products, what they built in that

142
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:19,365
way, the consumers will be easily able
to pick the right products for them.

143
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:24,115
And it also helps to bring the cost of
insurance down because now they don't have

144
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:28,885
to spend too much of money on marketing
or to acquire a consumer because most

145
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:32,125
of these products, depending on the
data insights, what we achieve from

146
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,444
pattern recognition, it will help us.

147
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:39,165
Customize the products for consumers in
such a way that you know, it's catering

148
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,475
to a mass market at the same time making
sure that you know we are taking into

149
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:47,924
account their individual preferences
and different data points proactive

150
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:52,734
engagement So this also helps us in
predicting the proactive engagement and

151
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:57,000
future needs from consumers, you know
How the consumer would predict five years

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,750
from now, how the consumer trend would
change 10 years from now So all this, you

153
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,380
know will be done using ai and machine
learning algorithms Which the system

154
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,529
will automatically be able to recognize
using different data points and trends

155
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:17,045
Based on the historical data and consumer
behavior So that is how we use AI and ML

156
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:20,005
in predicting consumer behavior analysis.

157
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:23,704
So moving on to the next
slide, which basically speaks

158
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:25,265
about customer satisfaction.

159
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:29,135
So simple thing, we have three main points
for increasing customer satisfaction.

160
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:33,165
Whenever we create a product, whenever
we create a service, it should be

161
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:35,115
customer centric and customer focused.

162
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:39,965
So by using AI and machine learning,
we make sure that we hit three main

163
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:42,415
important nodes of customer satisfaction.

164
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:45,285
One is we are creating a
tailored product, right?

165
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:49,715
Because AI will allow the companies
to design personalized policies, which

166
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:53,325
will reflect their unique preferences
and needs and financial situations.

167
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:57,725
And it will also improve the engagement
with customers because AI can offer

168
00:09:57,745 --> 00:10:03,610
solutions 24 by seven with customer
support like chatbots And if in case

169
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,800
the customer has some sort of inquiries
to make, he doesn't have to wait

170
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,690
the next business day to talk to a
person, but instead, talk to a bot,

171
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,730
chat bot or a virtual assistant and
get responses accurately immediately.

172
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,750
And then we can also
improve increased retention.

173
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,720
So by delivering more relevant
and personalized services.

174
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,600
The companies can enhance customer
satisfaction Thereby leading to higher

175
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,050
retention rates and lower churn factor.

176
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,060
So moving on to the next slide So what are
the key benefits of ai and ml integration?

177
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:39,375
So the key benefits are basically,
it helps us, as I spoke earlier,

178
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:40,975
with efficiency gains, right?

179
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:44,145
Because we are automating much
of this process and claims and

180
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,305
underwriting and fraud detection.

181
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:48,195
Everything is more streamlined now.

182
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:51,165
the operations processes are
more streamlined and much more

183
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:52,755
faster and more efficient.

184
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:54,285
Fraud prevention.

185
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:58,515
So the real time anomaly detection
powered by AI will significantly reduce

186
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:02,955
the risk of fraud because it will help
us detect fraud much earlier in the

187
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,745
game than towards end of the process.

188
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,990
Thereby safeguarding the company's
financial interest and most of the

189
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,980
decision making is data driven, right?

190
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,280
So we use something called as predictive
analytics, which actually improves

191
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,300
decision making by forecasting
consumer needs, risks, and trends

192
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,000
based on the historical data.

193
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,140
So these are the three different benefits
of, using artificial intelligence

194
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,739
and machine learning integration.

195
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,410
So moving on to the next,
which is basically case studies

196
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,490
and success stories, right?

197
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,900
So one of the case studies is at
a large life insurance company.

198
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,940
I would not like to take names, but,
there was an AI driven claims automation

199
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,270
system, which was actually implemented.

200
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,360
And then, looking at the metrics
and looking at the tangibility

201
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,350
of this, implementation of
system of using AI, right?

202
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,920
They were able to reduce the claims
processing time by almost 40%.

203
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:54,939
Okay.

204
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,840
So let's say if before the AI
implementation automation system was

205
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,580
implemented, if the claims processing
time took like almost two days, it

206
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,480
was actually drastically reduced to
few days to process a claim after an

207
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,450
AI automation system was implemented.

208
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,240
Same thing at a different company, AI
was used to build personalized product

209
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,190
recommendations based on utilizing
the last customer historical data,

210
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,580
including the payment history, the
demographics and purchasing patterns.

211
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,720
So by doing this, they were
able to personalize and

212
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,090
create new product offerings.

213
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,580
And then the company saw a 20 percent
increase in customer retention.

214
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,500
So what is the road?

215
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,220
So this is very important for us.

216
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,750
So what is the roadmap
for AI and ML adoption?

217
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,840
Because even before we get started, we
need to understand what is the key benefit

218
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,690
for the need of implementing an AI in a
particular process or a company, right?

219
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,980
So there are different steps, as you
can see, first, we need to identify

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,810
the key areas for AI implementation.

221
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:57,285
So we have to start with something
called as claims processing and

222
00:12:57,285 --> 00:13:00,195
customer analytics, where the
highest impact can be achieved.

223
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:03,415
And then we have to develop
a solid data strategy, right?

224
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:07,155
Because any AI model or ML,
machine learning model, is

225
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:08,615
as good as the data, right?

226
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:11,365
Because, and we have to make
sure that the right data is

227
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,215
collected and managed, right?

228
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:18,145
And it needs to follow a compliant
and ethical manner to make sure

229
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:22,825
that we are powering the, AI or ML
tools, in a compliant manner And

230
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:26,725
then the step three is creating or
building AI or ML capabilities, right?

231
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,515
Whether it might be in house development
or we can partner with so many vendors

232
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:34,635
outside in the market Who actually
provide us this AI services, right?

233
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:38,775
We can build the necessary AI or
automation Into a particular company.

234
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:41,805
And then the fourth step is
continuous improvement, right?

235
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:47,145
So any AI system must be monitored,
tested, and optimized regularly to make

236
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:51,345
sure that they are delivering the desired
results and adapt to changing needs.

237
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:54,525
According to the business objective
of our company, it should be

238
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:58,215
parallel and supporting the company's
business objective of implementing

239
00:13:58,215 --> 00:13:59,895
an AI into a particular system.

240
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:05,915
So these are the four different steps
for four basic steps, In general, what

241
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:09,945
we need to understand before actually,
implementing an AI model in a particular

242
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:13,355
process or a company and in conclusion.

243
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:17,775
So I know we spoke a lot about, artificial
intelligence and machine learning, so

244
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:22,204
to my, to my, experience and so far
the data, what I've seen in the market,

245
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:26,004
The artificial intelligence and machine
learning, it actually represents a

246
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:30,344
very big transformative opportunity for
insurers, to streamline their operations.

247
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:34,424
And to provide a more personalized
and efficient customer experience

248
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:38,574
So by automating key processes like
claims handling and leveraging data

249
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:43,324
driven insights, we can create and
predict consumer behavior We can create

250
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:48,204
personalized products and we can reduce
operation costs, you know improve fraud

251
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:52,494
detection and overall, improve the
customer satisfaction service delivery.

252
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:56,444
So these are some of the key, benefits
of using AI and machine learning

253
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:57,834
in the life and annuity space.

254
00:14:57,934 --> 00:15:01,904
thank you for giving me this
opportunity, for presenting and the

255
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:05,334
transformative impact of, artificial
intelligence and machine learning

256
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:08,014
in life Thank you, everyone.
