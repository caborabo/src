00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,509
Hello everyone, my name is Bishal Khadke
and today I will be sharing how natural

2
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:24,680
language processing or NLP is transforming
the way we interact with technology

3
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,840
from chatbot to voice assistant.

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,110
NLP is everywhere.

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,729
We will be diving into two
powerful applications, sentiment

6
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:35,510
analysis and language generation.

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,680
But before we start, let me ask you this.

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,080
Have you ever wondered how Alexa
or Siri understands your voice

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,449
commands, or how Google translates
instantly an entire page of text?

10
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:52,239
That's NLP working behind the scenes.

11
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,850
I'm really excited to share how these
technologies are reshaping industries.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,330
Let's dive in.

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,330
Here is a quick roadmap of today's talk.

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,210
Introduction to NLP.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,520
We will explore what
NLP is and how it works.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,120
This involves decoding human emotions
from text for sentiment analysis

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,170
and how machine can generate human
like text in language generation.

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,749
Beyond the true applications, in the
broader applications of NLP, we will

19
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:28,280
look into how NLP is used in healthcare,
finance, and many more industries.

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,240
Key benefits of mastering NLP.

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,910
Why should businesses and
professionals embrace NLP?

22
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,980
What will be the future of NLP and AI?

23
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,240
Finally, we will wrap up with
the conclusion and take a risk.

24
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,820
Let's dive into the first section,

25
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,830
Introduction to the NLP.

26
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:55,139
Natural Language Processing or NLP is a
branch of AI that enables computers to

27
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:57,770
understand and generate human language.

28
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,809
It bridges the gap between human
communication and machine comprehension.

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,780
Imagine talking to a computer
and it perfectly understands your

30
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,840
intent from translating languages
to analyze customer reviews and

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,600
NLP powers countless applications.

32
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,290
Historically, NLP started with
systems like ELISA in 1960s, which

33
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,660
mimicked simple human conversation.

34
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,860
But we have come a long way since then.

35
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:35,050
Now, with models like GPT 3, GPT 4, and
BERT, NLP can write entire articles.

36
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:40,745
answer complex questions, and even
hold conversations that feel natural.

37
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:46,665
To give you a real world example,
let's look at a Google Translate.

38
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:52,271
It uses NLP to instantly
translate entire sentences while

39
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:54,265
keeping the meaning intact.

40
00:02:54,265 --> 00:03:00,375
Or consider tools like Grammarly,
which uses NLP to analyze your writing.

41
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:03,035
Correct errors and suggest improvements.

42
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:10,265
NLP has become so ingrained in our daily
lives that we almost take it for granted.

43
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:15,684
Next time you use a chatbot or virtual
assistant, think about powerful

44
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:17,755
technology working behind the scenes.

45
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:23,765
Let's dive into one of the most popular
applications of NLP, Sentiment Analysis.

46
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:28,565
It's a technique used to determine
the emotional tone behind a

47
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:32,334
piece of text, whether it's
positive, negative, or neutral.

48
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:38,060
Let's Companies use it to understand
customer feedback, gauge public opinion,

49
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,240
and even monitor social media sentiment.

50
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,760
For example, imagine you are a business
owner with thousands of online reviews,

51
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,265
sentiment analysis, can automatically
categorize these reviews into positive,

52
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:57,935
negative, or neutral, helping you
quickly identify customer pain points

53
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:01,245
or successes on a technical level.

54
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:07,225
Sentiment analysis works by
analyzing pattern in text using

55
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:09,065
models trained on large datasets.

56
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:16,044
These models recognize words and
phrases that are commonly associated

57
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:17,745
with positive or negative sentiments.

58
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,704
For instance, phrase like, I love you.

59
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:25,985
Will be classified as positive while I
hate it will be classified as negative

60
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:32,445
one of the challenge in sentiment
analysis is understanding the context.

61
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,755
For example, this product is
the worst thing I ever loved.

62
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:42,119
Might confuse the simple model,
but thanks to modern NLP models,

63
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:47,226
we are better equipped to recognize
sarcasm, irony, and even mixed

64
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:49,464
emotions within the same sentence.

65
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:55,735
Now let's talk about how
businesses are using sentiment

66
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,335
analysis in the real world.

67
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,585
Take a real industry of a retail site.

68
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:06,534
For example, retailers use
sentiment analysis to track customer

69
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:08,744
reviews and social media comments.

70
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:14,144
If there's a sudden spike in negative
feedback about a product, sentiment

71
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:18,824
analysis can flag it immediately,
allowing the company to respond

72
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:20,524
before the situation escalates.

73
00:05:22,194 --> 00:05:25,814
Another great use of sentiment
analysis is in finance sector.

74
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,510
Financial institutions track public
sentiment to gauge market trends.

75
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,779
For instance, by analyzing how
people talk about stocks on social

76
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,229
media, sentiment analysis can offer
insights into market sentiment.

77
00:05:42,735 --> 00:05:45,084
Helping investors make better decisions.

78
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:52,155
Also in the sector of politics
or technology, you name it, an

79
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:53,664
NLP is scattering everywhere.

80
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:59,275
There are just a few examples,
but sentiment analysis has wide

81
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:04,474
ranging applications, making it
essential tool for businesses that

82
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:06,074
want to stay ahead of the curve.

83
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:10,244
Let's move to the field
of language generation.

84
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:16,965
Another key NLP application which refers
to machine's ability to generate human

85
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:19,842
like text based on the input it receives.

86
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:25,284
If you ever use a virtual assistant
like Siri or a chatbot, you have

87
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:27,424
experienced language generation in action.

88
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:31,234
Language generation is
powered by Neuralink.

89
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:35,474
They are trained on massive
data sets of human language.

90
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:40,714
These models learn the structure and
pattern of language allowing them to

91
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:43,124
predict and generate coherent sentences.

92
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:47,324
For example, you ask
Alexa about the weather.

93
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:50,324
It doesn't just give a
grammatically correct answer.

94
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:54,614
It understands the context and
generates a response that makes sense.

95
00:06:55,414 --> 00:07:02,574
Models like GPT 3 or GPT 4 have
taken this step further, enabling

96
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:08,314
machines to generate long form
content such as essays and even

97
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:10,484
software code based on simple prompts.

98
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,279
The process of language generation
involves the model predicting the

99
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,139
next word or phrase in a sentence.

100
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,369
The more data the model has
been trained on, the better it

101
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,199
becomes at generating accurate and
contextually relevant responses.

102
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,839
This technology is being used in
industries like customer service where

103
