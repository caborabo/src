1
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:18,279
The future of work, engaged
leadership, and empowered teams.

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,880
I am passionate about this topic.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,390
And why?

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,450
Because I hate waste.

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,279
I hate when people's work is wasted.

6
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,869
I hate when people's careers are wasted.

7
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:35,495
I hate when the project that they worked
so hard on, they worked nights and

8
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:41,095
weekends, and then that project gets
canceled and all that work was wasted.

9
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:47,115
Oh, it hurts me to see people suffer
because they feel like their work

10
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:49,484
is wasted, not worth anything.

11
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:52,144
I have been very fortunate.

12
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:58,144
I have had wonderful opportunities and
I love my work and I was able to lead

13
00:00:58,144 --> 00:01:00,814
teams to deliver innovative products.

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:10,039
My team delivered the first commercial
version of RPC, a revolutionary mechanism

15
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,589
for devices to talk to one another.

16
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,309
I've led teams who love to come to work.

17
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,609
They were inspired to
propose new features.

18
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:24,770
They were excited to deliver products
that people would line up to buy.

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,020
I'm Leslie Martinich, and I'm going
to talk about why we need RPC.

20
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:33,919
New types of leadership, and
you'll see that in just a minute.

21
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:40,429
But part of the reason is that
technology and society have changed.

22
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,249
Society has changed dramatically because
of COVID and technology has allowed us

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,209
choices that we did not have before.

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,860
Now we need a new kind of leadership, a
leadership that will see teams delivering

25
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,980
products faster and more happily.

26
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,570
because they own their projects.

27
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,909
A leadership that will inspire teams to
aspire to targets that they previously

28
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,779
didn't even believe were possible.

29
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:17,779
Leadership that builds careers,
leadership that builds companies,

30
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,789
leadership that builds entire industries.

31
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:29,109
So what is the problem and why do
we need a new type of leadership?

32
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,950
here's one reason.

33
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,280
Currently, 65 percent of
employees are not engaged.

34
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,560
And of those, 20 percent are
actively disengaged, which means that

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,379
they've got one foot out the door.

36
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,940
They don't enjoy their work.

37
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:49,779
They don't even come to
work if they can avoid it.

38
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:53,160
They're not focused on
getting anything done.

39
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,820
They're just there, if
they're there at all.

40
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,230
Only 20 percent are actively engaged.

41
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,040
We want everybody to be actively
engaged, but right now only 20

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,050
percent are actively engaged.

43
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,959
That's just not going to cut it.

44
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,580
We need everybody to be actively engaged.

45
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:17,490
Leaders goal is our, leaders have
a goal, and that's to hire and

46
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,370
retain a productive workforce.

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,410
So here we have a productive
workforce looking all happy because

48
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,740
they're getting their project done.

49
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,140
They're getting their work done.

50
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,620
They're seeing the light
of day with their project.

51
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:30,920
they're happy about that.

52
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,610
But what is the big challenge?

53
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:40,729
Why, and especially for remote workplaces,
why are people not engaged right now?

54
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:44,139
the number one issue is trust.

55
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:46,839
That's the challenge.

56
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,470
For the workplace of the future.

57
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,740
And that's what we're talking about.

58
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:56,390
The future of work, the
future of work requires trust.

59
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,940
Trust can boost productivity by up to 50%.

60
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,610
It can improve retention by up to 65%.

61
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,960
And that is huge.

62
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,650
And it can boost the speed
of decision making as well.

63
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:19,899
What are the economics of trust?

64
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:27,169
When trust goes up, the speed of product
delivery goes up and the costs go down.

65
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,839
When trust goes down, the speed
goes down and the costs go way up.

66
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:42,959
Think of the amount of money
it costs and the slowdown in

67
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,679
speed that it costs you and me.

68
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:51,089
To go through an airport since
the 11th of September in 2001.

69
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,479
Now people don't trust
each other on airplanes.

70
00:04:54,929 --> 00:05:00,479
We don't trust that everybody
is a reliable flying partner.

71
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:10,409
And so we have all these TSA security
places and security lines to go through.

72
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,979
What's the, what are the costs of that?

73
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:13,779
Oh my gosh.

74
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:20,859
Putting in gigantic scanners in
every airport, in every country

75
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:28,799
in the world, putting in all
sorts of logistics to handle that.

76
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:36,969
Hiring all sorts of security agents,
not to mention their dogs, but all

77
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:42,179
sorts of security agents to manage
people going through lines in airports.

78
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:44,559
That is a lot.

79
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:54,139
When, when Warren Buffett wanted to buy,
a company called McLean Distribution from

80
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:00,039
Walmart, he sat down with the Walmart
executives and had a two hour meeting.

81
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,379
They trusted one another.

82
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:06,989
They came to a conclusion based
on that two hour meeting, and

83
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:10,049
the deal closed in one month.

84
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,999
There's no wasting of months.

85
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:19,744
of due diligence, of
millions of attorney's fees.

86
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:25,464
Trust made that faster
and much lower costs.

87
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:29,924
So I just wanted to give you that
example of how trust can enable

88
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:32,694
things to go so much faster.

89
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:41,154
So people want choices, but leaders
still want control and that's a problem.

90
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:46,914
And it's a problem because the leaders are
focused on the management side of things.

91
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:52,784
They're focused on, they go to
training for leadership development

92
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:58,534
for meeting management, product
management, risk management, performance

93
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:03,224
management, and all sorts of things
with the word management in there.

94
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:06,744
And they're all important,
but they're all about control.

95
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:11,599
And that's It's not getting
to what makes employees happy.

96
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:15,299
They're very, these are very
last century things and Jack

97
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,629
Welch's style no longer works.

98
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:24,129
So here's a thought from
Steve Jobs that I like.

99
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:31,369
Management is about persuading people to
do things they do not want to do, while

100
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:35,009
leadership is about inspiring people.

101
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:38,334
to do things they never
thought they could.

102
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:39,784
I love that quote.

103
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:41,104
that's just so right.

104
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:46,274
So trust also requires ethical behavior.

105
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:52,434
You don't trust people who you
perceive to be unethical, taking,

106
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:58,314
making shortcuts, not doing things
that you consider trustworthy.

107
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:00,724
that's the word, trustworthy.

108
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:07,129
So the ethical challenges are taking
shortcuts, financial considerations,

109
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:10,509
maybe it's cheaper if we take
this shortcut, and then there's

110
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:12,439
also political considerations.

111
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,799
So let's talk a minute about
ethical behavior, and this will

112
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:22,059
be a, really fast lesson in the
history of the philosophy of ethics.

113
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:26,679
So ethics is a practice of
making choices and decisions.

114
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:28,549
You make one choice, it's fine.

115
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:32,129
It's an ethical choice and you
make another choice and maybe

116
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:34,059
it's a not so ethical choice.

117
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:43,529
but ethical behavior results in trust and
it results in a lot less risk of disaster.

118
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:49,099
So let's look at this
history of philosophy.

119
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,809
So philosophers try to
understand how the world works.

120
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,249
So with each time there's a new.

121
00:08:55,774 --> 00:09:01,064
area of understanding than yet
another leaf sprouts on this tree.

122
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:06,724
So we start at the bottom, with,
say metaphysics and physics.

123
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:11,044
And we have some philosophers
trying to understand those ancient

124
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:14,914
Greek philosophers, and then
they get that down a little bit.

125
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:20,854
And then, we move on to mechanics
and then the tree branch on the

126
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:23,684
right is logic and then linguistics.

127
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:27,394
And then out of that sprouts
artificial intelligence.

128
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:33,614
Each time we get a pretty good
understanding of one of the branches

129
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:39,724
of this tree or one set of leaves,
a new set of leaves sprouts.

130
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:43,854
So out of logic and a few
other things comes linguistics.

131
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:47,774
And out of linguistics and
logic and a few other things

132
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:50,114
comes artificial intelligence.

133
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:55,374
We're going to look at that more
central branch, the one with ethics.

134
00:09:55,624 --> 00:10:00,244
It's up top, and let's take
that, take a look at that.

135
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:03,454
And we're going to talk about
four philosophers who are

136
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:05,654
critical in the history of ethics.

137
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:11,134
The first is Aristotle, way down at the
bottom left, and then Immanuel Kant, and

138
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:13,794
then Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.

139
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,524
So let's start with Aristotle.

140
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:21,664
Aristotle and Plato's the guy on
the left there, Aristotle and Plato

141
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:25,844
were concerned with virtue and
character and practical wisdom.

142
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:29,754
Remember, philosophers are always
trying to figure out how the

143
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,154
world works, how people work.

144
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:34,704
What does it mean to be a good person?

145
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:38,254
What does it mean to be a person?

146
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:42,054
And so they were consider, concerned
about virtue and character.

147
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:48,754
And I want to reduce that for you for, to
make your job to be ethical really quick.

148
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,814
So you have one question to
ask, can you sleep at night?

149
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:56,264
So when you're faced
with an ethical dilemma.

150
00:10:56,594 --> 00:11:00,874
You might try asking, can I sleep
at night if I make this choice?

151
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:02,014
Okay.

152
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:10,974
The next guy up is Immanuel Kant, a German
philosopher who lived in the 18th century.

153
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:15,064
And he was very concerned
about duties and rights.

154
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:21,394
He had a focus on standards
and the categorical imperative.

155
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,724
And categorical means in all cases.

156
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:25,964
categorically.

157
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:31,174
Declare this to be false, whatever, in
all cases, I declare this to be false,

158
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:36,674
categorical means that, in all cases,
an imperative, something that has to be.

159
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:42,984
So a quick question to ask yourself
when you're considering Kant's

160
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:49,174
offering to the ethical tree
is, what if everybody did this?

161
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:53,884
That's the category, that's the
categorical part, everybody.

162
00:11:54,324 --> 00:11:56,284
What if everybody did this?

163
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:58,664
That's a good question to ask.

164
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:05,644
And then we come to Jeremy Bentham and
John Stuart Mill, late 18th century

165
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:10,774
to early 19th century, and they, and
John, Jeremy Bentham came up with the

166
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:15,994
idea of utilitarianism, and he was all
about happiness, and so he was looking

167
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:23,939
for what was the greatest good for
the greatest number, or Alternatively,

168
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:26,369
what's the least harm to people?

169
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:32,179
So Bentham and Mill really laid
out and defined the ethical

170
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:33,209
concepts of utilitarianism.

171
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,899
now you have three questions to
ask yourself, three approaches when

172
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,029
you're faced with any ethical dilemma.

173
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,109
Can I sleep at night?

174
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,629
What if everybody did this?

175
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,829
And what's the greatest good
for the greatest number?

176
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:47,209
And I.

177
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:51,079
I think these are writer downers,
you should write these down because

178
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:54,819
you can ask yourself or just
take a picture of your screen.

179
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,859
You can ask yourself these
questions whenever you're

180
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,339
faced with an ethical dilemma.

181
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:05,389
And usually at least one of them is
going to work out to be useful to you to

182
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,059
think about which path you should take.

183
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:11,219
So let's look at the Challenger disaster.

184
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,189
Happened in 1986.

185
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:22,119
And this is a picture of the
scaffolding, and that's the gray tubing

186
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:25,889
you can see with ice forming on it.

187
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:30,169
And right behind that is one of the
rocket boosters right behind it.

188
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:36,189
It is a really cold that morning that the
Challenger is getting ready to take off.

189
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,189
So here is the situation.

190
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:45,069
This was the coldest ever launch date.

191
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:48,509
The previous cold temperature
had been 53 degrees Fahrenheit.

192
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:55,014
The forecast temperature for that
day is 38, I'm sorry, 28 degrees

193
00:13:55,304 --> 00:13:57,174
Fahrenheit, which is below freezing.

194
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:04,604
NASA and their supplier, Morton Thiokol,
which I'll call Morton Thiokol Engineers,

195
00:14:06,244 --> 00:14:11,984
get together the, or have a conference
call the night before to discuss

196
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,814
the O rings and cold temperatures.

197
00:14:14,814 --> 00:14:22,054
For And Morton Thiokol engineers know
that they really haven't tested their

198
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:26,894
O rings in these cold temperatures,
but they don't really expect them

199
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:32,354
to seal properly in that cold.

200
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:37,184
They expect them to be, not
pliable enough to seal properly.

201
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:42,864
So the Morton Thiokol engineers
recommend against the launch.

202
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,179
They come to an impasse in their
discussions, so they take a recess.

203
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,489
And after the recess, the Morton
Thiokol group said that their

204
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:59,849
evidence was inconclusive, so go
ahead and proceed with the launch.

205
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:06,849
Now, we all know what happened, This
is an O ring, just to, just to give

206
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:08,469
you a sense of how big they are.

207
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,329
When I first heard about this disaster,
which was the day it happened.

208
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:17,979
I thought O rings were probably something
that were about the size of a bracelet.

209
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:26,719
but that O ring was too cold to seal,
and it allowed hot gases to pass through.

210
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,219
Not good.

211
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:36,849
So after the launch, after 68
seconds, the entire rocket ship was

212
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:41,159
engulfed in flaming hot propellant.

213
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:47,204
And in 71 seconds Once
the Challenger exploded,

214
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:51,104
it was a terrible day.

215
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:59,884
So what would you have done if you
were a Morton Thiokol engineer?

216
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:05,024
And you could ask yourself about what your
recommendations would be, and you can ask

217
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:10,714
yourself, if I make this recommendation,
will I be able to sleep at night?

218
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:17,504
Or, what if everybody made recommendations
like this or took risks like this?

219
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:23,714
Or, you can ask yourself, what's the
greatest good for the greatest number?

220
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:26,534
Yeah.

221
00:16:27,844 --> 00:16:28,844
what happened?

222
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:34,794
they come back from their recess, and
the Martin Thakal engineers say, it's

223
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:38,994
inconclusive, we don't really have
the data because we've never tested

224
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:40,964
the O rings at this temperature.

225
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:48,345
Whoever made the final decision to, to
launch, did they not take the engineer's

226
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:53,395
concerns seriously, or did they want
to take a shortcut so they wouldn't

227
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:55,795
be blamed for holding up the launch?

228
00:16:56,165 --> 00:17:00,535
This was a, a launch that had
been delayed many times already.

229
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:06,065
People were anxious to
get this off the ground.

230
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:07,795
This was the first.

231
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:12,985
Space Shuttle launch that
involved a teacher in space.

232
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:19,225
So every school room in the country
is watching this as it happens.

233
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:23,485
Every parent was watching
this as it happened.

234
00:17:23,485 --> 00:17:27,555
It was something that had a great
deal of publicity and everyone

235
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:29,315
was excited to see it happen.

236
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:33,805
And so everybody's looking
at TVs and then it blows up.

237
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:38,235
what happened to make, to allow
them to make that decision?

238
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:38,299
I don't know.

239
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,430
I think it's important to consider
how to communicate effectively.

240
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,620
Now, you don't want to be Chicken
Little running around yelling, Oh, this

241
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,380
guy is falling, this guy is falling.

242
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,310
Every time you see a risk.

243
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,490
You wouldn't be able to, get
out of the house in the morning

244
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,530
if everything were a risk.

245
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,130
Also, you don't want to be the
old lady who waits till the damage

246
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,440
happens and then says, Injured?

247
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,420
I told you But you didn't listen.

248
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,780
Call 1 800 BOO HOO.

249
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,130
You don't want to be
either of those people.

250
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:23,740
You don't want to lose your credibility
by claiming everything's a disaster

251
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,900
before you know for sure it is.

252
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,760
You don't want to be chicken little
over there and you don't want to

253
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,320
just salt and wait until the disaster
happens and then say, I told them

254
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,600
They should have listened to me.

255
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,420
that's not.

256
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:39,255
Not gonna win you any points.

257
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:43,645
So communicating is everyone's job.

258
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:47,825
It's important for the leaders to
communicate, but it's also important

259
00:18:47,845 --> 00:18:53,075
for the individual contributors to
communicate because the individual

260
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:57,395
contributor is probably the one who
knows best when there is a risk.

261
00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:05,235
When there is a risk of making a
decision, and that is the ethical

262
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:07,185
dilemma, what decision shall we make?

263
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:18,275
when they have to communicate to
their leaders what the risks are

264
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:23,615
so that the leaders understand
them and take them seriously.

265
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:28,945
So in order to do that communication,
you need to understand what

266
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:30,775
your audience cares about.

267
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,485
What is important to them.

268
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,910
Put the communication in their terms.

269
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,490
So here's an example of
a way to communicate.

270
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,440
I know we all want to help this
launch proceed smoothly, and we

271
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,800
all want the Challenger to launch
and return to Earth safely.

272
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,310
In order for us to feel confident
that can happen, we need to wait

273
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,310
until the temperature is warmer.

274
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,279
That would be a way of communicating
it, a way of communicating it.

275
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,100
Communicating that you understand that
the other person wants to get this launch

276
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,930
off but they want to get it off safely.

277
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,970
And so you're not confident that can
happen until the temperature is warmer.

278
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,440
That communicates that.

279
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:27,850
That's not just the leader's job, it's
everybody's job to learn to communicate.

280
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,100
So know what your audience cares about.

281
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,270
In this case, NASA cared about you.

282
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,800
NASA was the audience.

283
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,520
They cared about getting
this launch off the ground.

284
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,170
Of course, everybody was anticipating it.

285
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,880
They'd already been delayed and delayed,
and they didn't want to be delayed again.

286
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,460
So they wanted it to take off.

287
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:53,150
And then, once you understand what
the other person, your audience, cares

288
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,720
about, then you put it in their terms.

289
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,215
I know you care about this.

290
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:03,705
Getting this launch off and helping
people to come back smoothly.

291
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:09,175
So what's your action after I've
just talked about all these things?

292
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:14,835
Your action is to become
a trusted, engaged leader.

293
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:17,895
What does that involve?

294
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:19,555
That involves,

295
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:23,945
first, behaving in an ethical manner.

296
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:27,115
And I told you the three
questions you could ask yourself.

297
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,730
Will I be able to sleep at night?

298
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,090
What's the greatest good
for the greatest number?

299
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,720
And, what if everybody did this?

300
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,860
what if everybody took these shortcuts?

301
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,970
The world would be
pretty crazy pretty soon.

302
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,870
becoming a trusted, engaged
leader takes practice.

303
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,580
You need to practice those
ethical behaviors, making

304
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,360
decisions in an ethical manner.

305
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:03,310
You need to learn to be an engaged
leader, and that means to be present.

306
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,420
Being there, being present, you're
not, when someone's talking to you,

307
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:15,530
you're not looking at your devices,
you're not looking over their

308
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,440
shoulder to see if somebody more
important is coming down the hall.

309
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,175
You're not, checking your watch.

310
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:22,785
You're not saying, I got to run.

311
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:24,135
I've got more meetings.

312
00:22:24,835 --> 00:22:26,085
Of course you have more meetings.

313
00:22:26,285 --> 00:22:31,885
You always have more meetings, but be
present when someone is talking to you.

314
00:22:33,715 --> 00:22:35,225
Be respectful.

315
00:22:35,265 --> 00:22:36,225
That's number two.

316
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:37,555
Be respectful.

317
00:22:38,045 --> 00:22:42,875
When an employee brings you a
problem, you don't, and you think

318
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:48,785
It's not serious and you don't
just say, Oh, you worry too much.

319
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,225
It's not a serious problem.

320
00:22:50,895 --> 00:22:56,845
Instead, be respectful and say,
I see that's a concern to you.

321
00:22:58,405 --> 00:22:59,765
Tell me more about that.

322
00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:00,475
Okay.

323
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:01,775
Now that's easy.

324
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:06,965
So when you're thinking,
this guy must be crazy.

325
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,905
He's worrying about everything.

326
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:12,385
Instead, pull this one
out of your back pocket.

327
00:23:12,815 --> 00:23:14,645
I see that's a concern to you.

328
00:23:15,075 --> 00:23:16,155
Tell me more about that.

329
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:20,825
And the third one is to listen.

330
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:25,295
When an employee brings you an
idea and you think the idea is

331
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:33,215
wacko, say, I see you think that
feature X would improve the product.

332
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:36,045
Tell me more.

333
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:41,355
How can we implement that
without bumping the schedule?

334
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,830
Don't just say, I don't
think we can do that.

335
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,930
It's just not going to
fit in the schedule.

336
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:55,060
Instead, listen and ask
for more information rather

337
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,470
than just dismissing them.

338
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,940
Listen when they bring you ideas.

339
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,510
I see you think that feature
would improve the product.

340
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,890
Tell me more.

341
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,830
And can you figure out how
we could implement that

342
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,070
without bumping the schedule?

343
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,980
This is just something you can say.

344
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:16,340
To not just be dismissive of the
employee, but listening to them.

345
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,320
And then this is the really fun part.

346
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:24,350
Listening gives you
opportunities for creativity.

347
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,420
So somebody may come up with a really
good idea, but you didn't see how it could

348
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,620
be done without bumping the schedule.

349
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,330
And that's what you care.

350
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,320
You care about the schedule.

351
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,550
You want it done on time, right?

352
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,400
no, you just not even going to
entertain ideas for new features.

353
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:42,625
But instead, listen to them.

354
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:46,825
Maybe they have a way of implementing
that without bumping the schedule.

355
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:55,134
Another aspect of being an engaged
leader is to enlist your team.

356
00:24:56,435 --> 00:24:57,914
Enlist your team.

357
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:03,644
You hired them because they were smart.

358
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:07,825
You hired them because they were talented.

359
00:25:08,385 --> 00:25:09,825
You didn't hire a bunch of dummies.

360
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:14,895
Enlist them to help solve some of the
problems, to help define some of the

361
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:20,005
processes that you're going to use, to
help them define some of the products.

362
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:27,034
Instead of you mapping out the
architecture, the chunks of work, the

363
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:33,244
dependencies, the schedule, everything,
and then just saying, okay, here, you do

364
00:25:33,244 --> 00:25:37,254
this chunk and I need it in five days.

365
00:25:37,855 --> 00:25:41,785
You do this chunk, and by the way,
Joe has to finish his chunk of

366
00:25:41,785 --> 00:25:44,095
work before Susie can start hers.

367
00:25:44,555 --> 00:25:49,815
Now, you don't map it out and tell
people just what to do without really

368
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:53,925
helping, without really letting
them help with, that definition.

369
00:25:54,314 --> 00:25:56,195
So instead, you enlist them.

370
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:56,965
They're smart.

371
00:25:57,315 --> 00:25:58,245
They're talented.

372
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:01,445
So ask them to help you.

373
00:26:01,985 --> 00:26:04,995
Say, here, we have an opportunity
to work on this project.

374
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,620
Here are the basic outlines and
constraints, like it has to be done

375
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,190
in time for this big trade show.

376
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:20,190
but you enlist them and you ask
them how they would architect it.

377
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,910
How they would define it.

378
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:25,200
How they would, break down the chunks.

379
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,830
Who the chunks would get assigned to.

380
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,130
Ask the people who wants
these chunks of work.

381
00:26:32,015 --> 00:26:36,145
and then work together to come up with
a reasonable schedule and remember

382
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:41,375
that they're going to count into their
schedule just how long it would take

383
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:46,945
them to do that work without being
interrupted by other people asking

384
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:52,915
them questions, without meetings,
without emails, without all sorts of

385
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:55,045
things that just get in their way.

386
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:58,785
So put buffer in there and then ask them.

387
00:26:59,185 --> 00:26:59,585
Okay.

388
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:01,075
you wanted five days.

389
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:04,585
How about if I give you eight
days, will that work for you?

390
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:05,055
Oh yeah.

391
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:05,855
That'll work for me.

392
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:06,425
That's good.

393
00:27:06,865 --> 00:27:08,775
Now I'm the engineer.

394
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:10,215
I own the product.

395
00:27:10,784 --> 00:27:16,275
I own this because I only thought I needed
five days and my boss gave me eight.

396
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:17,195
So great.

397
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:22,705
I'm all on board with that and
help your team become empowered.

398
00:27:22,745 --> 00:27:24,385
And that takes practice.

399
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:31,470
here are the outcomes when you are an
engaged leader and you empower your team.

400
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,949
You have trust.

401
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,309
You have empowered teams.

402
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:42,200
You've improved retention.

403
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,180
And let's just take a moment
here to talk about retention.

404
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,020
Retention has the opportunity
for huge cost savings.

405
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:59,110
If you have a problem with people
leaving and really bad retention,

406
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,520
then you have a huge expense.

407
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,170
Let me give you an example.

408
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:12,460
Suppose your employees make, on average,
between their salaries and their benefits,

409
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,240
let's just say they make 175, 000 each.

410
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,530
And 10 of them quit in the last
year, so you had to pay them.

411
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,230
Replace 10 employees.

412
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,740
So the formula is, you take
their salary, and you double it.

413
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,920
And that's your cost to replace them.

414
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,810
It does not include their salary.

415
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,720
It's just the cost of the recruiters
working, the cost of the hiring

416
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:47,045
manager, reviewing resumes, interviewing
people, making the offer, negotiating

417
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:51,955
it, it's the cost of the team members
doing the interview, getting, and a

418
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:57,125
huge cost is the team members working
to get the new person up to speed.

419
00:28:57,495 --> 00:28:59,915
That's, it takes weeks, months.

420
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,705
So getting the new person
up to speed is a big cost.

421
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:12,605
if you have 10 employees at 175, 000
each, times 10, that's 1, 750, 000.

422
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:14,405
Times two, because it takes weeks.

423
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,135
That's 2x the salary to, replace them.

424
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:28,035
That's 3, 500, 000, 3, 500, 000 per year.

425
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:32,465
So what if engaged
leaders could do better?

426
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:35,045
They could improve that by half.

427
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:38,465
Say only five people
quit the following year.

428
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:43,895
That saves you 1, 750, 000.

429
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:45,515
That's a lot of money.

430
00:29:46,195 --> 00:29:47,875
So retention.

431
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:54,930
And building an engaged team and
having a productive, happy, empowered

432
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,390
team can save you a lot of money.

433
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,850
So that's a, retention is
a really good outcome here.

434
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,880
And then it's easier for you to recruit.

435
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,840
That's the next outcome, recruiting.

436
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:13,935
So when your employees are burned out
and disengaged, You really don't want

437
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:18,665
them interviewing potential candidates
because they're not really happy

438
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:22,165
about working here, and that's going
to show no matter what they think.

439
00:30:22,775 --> 00:30:28,435
but when you have a trusted team, an
engaged and empowered team, and they,

440
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:33,905
a team that owns its projects and can
hardly wait to work on them, then,

441
00:30:34,385 --> 00:30:37,125
that shows through to the candidates.

442
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:41,395
Also, The team will tell other
people in the community, wow,

443
00:30:41,395 --> 00:30:42,565
this is a great place to work.

444
00:30:42,565 --> 00:30:43,375
I really love it.

445
00:30:43,795 --> 00:30:45,515
My boss is fantastic.

446
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:52,975
So the recruitment becomes so much
easier if you have trust, engaged

447
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:54,775
leaders and empowered teams.

448
00:30:56,935 --> 00:30:59,785
And of course you have
better productivity.

449
00:31:00,415 --> 00:31:06,065
just imagine if you will, a
workplace where everyone felt heard.

450
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,190
That'd be nice.

451
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,650
A workplace where everyone felt seen

452
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,180
and a workplace where everyone
felt like their dias and their

453
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,860
work mattered, like they mattered.

454
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,680
That would be nice.

455
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,170
That's what you get with a
trusted workplace, empowered

456
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,100
teams, and engaged leaders.

457
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,300
It's a great thing.

458
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,090
I've experienced it.

459
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,830
Everyone loves it.

460
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:47,350
Just take some time, practice these
skills and you can have that too.

461
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:54,700
So if there's questions, I'm
always happy to answer questions.

462
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:02,060
I put up my LinkedIn connection and I
put up my email and my mobile phone.

463
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:08,175
So thank you very much for your
attention and Just let me know

464
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:09,385
if you've got some questions.

465
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,905
I hope you have a wonderful day.

466
00:32:10,985 --> 00:32:11,595
Thanks.
