1
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,759
Hello everyone, and welcome to
today's talk on demystifying RQX.

2
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,939
My name is Hari Krishna.

3
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,979
I work as an engineer.

4
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:24,685
Senior enterprise applications engineer
at a med school, and I'll be your

5
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,275
guide through this practical survey.

6
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:31,254
Oracle E Business Suite or EBS, is
a comprehensive enterprise software

7
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:33,855
solution used by organizations worldwide.

8
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:39,695
So as platform engineers, we understand
RISE components is crucial for successful

9
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:40,925
implementation and maintenance.

10
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:44,665
So let's dive in and explore
reports, interfaces, converters,

11
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:46,595
and extensions in Oracle EBS.

12
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:48,815
Before that, what is RISE?

13
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:52,245
RISE stands for Reports, Interfaces,
Conversions, and Extensions.

14
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:57,275
it's a framework, critical for
customization of, Oracle EBS.

15
00:00:57,335 --> 00:01:01,665
the modular approach of RISE helps
platform engineers adapt Oracle EBS

16
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:05,895
to meet evolving business demands,
improving scalability and automation.

17
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:10,455
This allows for smoother integration
into a platform centric architecture.

18
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:13,755
So let's start with reports.

19
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:20,085
So reports are a critical aspect of Oracle
EBS providing insights into business data.

20
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:23,605
So there are three, mainly three
types of reports, which, which

21
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:27,919
are like standard reports, custom
reports and ad hoc reports.

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,690
and the standard reports are pre built,
while you install Oracle or get the

23
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,449
product from Oracle, there are some
standard reports which Oracle gives you,

24
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,770
which is respective of the module, which,
with whatever module you get it, right?

25
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,960
and, while the custom reports are,
tailored for the specific needs,

26
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,510
obviously, every company which gets
it, they have their own requirements.

27
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,130
And Those, that's where the customer
reports come into picture with the

28
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,420
specific business needs and ad hoc
reports provide real time data analysis.

29
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,430
So when designing reports, consider data
sources, formatting and user requirements.

30
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:11,070
So best practices include using, Oracle,
suggested tools, reporting tools like

31
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,760
Oracle has their own report builder.

32
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,760
for to create Oracle reports, and
they have BA publisher and Oracle

33
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,980
BA, Business Intelligence Enterprise,
edition is also available, but it's

34
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,670
very rarely used, but, it's very less
used, but mostly, it's BA publisher.

35
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,945
I recommend BA publisher in Oracle, so.

36
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:32,165
let's get to interfaces now.

37
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:36,775
So interfaces enable communication
between, any system to any system, right?

38
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:42,035
it's a general terminology to use
for across all types of products.

39
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:44,745
if we are talking about EBS,
so it's a communication between

40
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:46,365
EBS and external systems.

41
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:51,745
So we have API based interfaces, file
based interfaces and messaging interfaces.

42
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,760
API based interfaces use web
interfaces, sorry, API uses

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,550
web services and RESTful APIs.

44
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,010
file based interfaces involve
data exchange through files.

45
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,170
And, messaging interfaces
use queues or topics.

46
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,770
When, when designing interfaces,
consider, Data formats for, data

47
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,030
formats, security and error handling.

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,320
these are critical things which you
need to look into for the security

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,940
workers because someone is trying to
get into your system or you are trying

50
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,310
to get into someone else's system.

51
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,270
There could be a lot of security
things in between or the firewalls.

52
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,650
that needs to be taken care of.

53
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,790
so, integrations tools such as Oracle
Integration Clouds, or Oracle SoaSuite.

54
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,160
are being used, very, nowadays, so
platform engineering real relies heavily

55
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,410
on seamless integration across systems.

56
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,160
So a PS and interfaces ensure
fluid communication between

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,070
Oracle EPS and various platforms.

58
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,150
So now let's get on to conversions.

59
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,410
Conversions involve data migration,
transformation, or loading, like type

60
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,930
of conversions include data migration.

61
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,790
Data warehousing and data archiving.

62
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,380
plan carefully considering data
quality, formatting and validation use.

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,600
gen we generally use Oracle, data
loading tools such as Oracle Data

64
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,160
Pump, Oracle SQL Loader, et cetera.

65
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,800
those are commonly used, for when
we do anything like into Oracle.

66
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,400
So if you are migrating something from a
different, interface application and it's

67
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,900
being shut down, you want to move the data
into Oracle, these tools are preferred.

68
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,920
um, for platform engineers here, the
efficient data migration strategies

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,910
are key to ensure a seeming transition
to modernize cloud based platform.

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,530
So conversion efforts directly,
impact a lot in the system because.

71
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,925
the s what, when you say about, when
you talk about a system, it's all data.

72
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:49,305
if there is data, there is a product
type, that's a system which runs around.

73
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:53,505
If there is, if the data was corrupted,
then it's, then, it's a big impact on,

74
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:55,165
on everything, which is running below it.

75
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:58,335
So, conversion plays a
critical role in there.

76
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:01,105
let's, move on to extensions now.

77
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:05,565
Extensions, enhance Oracle EBS
functionality through customizations.

78
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:12,085
Generally, modifications are like adding
new features to the existing one, right?

79
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:15,225
You need to extend the
existing functionality.

80
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:17,195
you can do in some ways.

81
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:22,585
Those things are extensions, like type
of extensions include custom tables,

82
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:24,195
you want to create custom tables.

83
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:26,865
You want to create custom
forms, like create a form.

84
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:31,525
You have standard forms, but you want to
create something which is, which has this

85
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:33,145
form data and some other custom data.

86
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:35,125
You want to load it there
and have something there.

87
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:39,136
You can still create custom
forms and custom work groups

88
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:41,165
like article as workflow window.

89
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:41,335
It's got it.

90
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:46,335
In the, but you can create a custom
workflow of every company has its own,

91
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:49,885
for example, approval workflow, right?

92
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:52,945
There could be three levels of
approvals or there could be 10

93
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:53,975
levels or there could be 15 levels.

94
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:56,425
Oracle allows you to create
custom workflows as well.

95
00:05:57,905 --> 00:06:00,275
So these are, these all
come under, extensions.

96
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:03,685
So type of, Oracle
Customization Guidelines.

97
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:09,255
we, and we, but creating, while creating,
extensions, we strictly need to follow

98
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:13,495
Oracle Customization Guidelines and
use tools like Oracle Application

99
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:15,265
Extension or Oracle JDeveloper.

100
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:18,665
And there are some setups which need
to do, keeping that in mind that

101
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,750
Oracle releases patches, every, twice
a year, if you don't follow the correct

102
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,150
process, aligned by Oracle, all your
changes, the custom changes will be

103
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,300
wiped out and you'll need to install
them again or create them again.

104
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,980
that's one thing you need to keep in mind.

105
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:36,215
So

106
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:41,295
when, so I, so

107
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:48,735
generally the, I did a small survey
and I got some information from

108
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:53,115
like from internet and here and
there, which is that most of the

109
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:58,005
manufacturing companies who are using
Oracle EBS, like using supply chain

110
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:02,855
P2P, O2C have saved almost 75 millions
through improved reporting services.

111
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:06,595
That's creating custom reports, and,
those kind of thing and retail chain

112
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:11,205
save 12 million via optimized supply
chain interfaces, financial institutes

113
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:16,045
changed, like financial institutes have
a lot of data, and it's a different kind

114
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:20,905
of data, which includes awards, grants,
and, all those things, so those in,

115
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:27,095
in those, in those cases, reports play
a lot of, Lot of big role and it has,

116
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:29,436
as per the analytics, it says that 99.

117
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:33,856
9 data accuracy post migration
for financial institutions.

118
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:37,916
So pharmaceutical company like save 15
million through extension customization.

119
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:45,036
yeah, when I said financial institution,
it's not, I just said reports, but it even

120
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:49,656
the data migration, it has a lot of data,
but Oracle is very seamless that you can.

121
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:56,971
You can migrate it, you have best services
given and, loadings after, you, the data

122
00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:01,781
accuracy post migration was considerably
good is what the case study says.

123
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:06,261
So the real world example illustrates
how RISE customizations when

124
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:09,911
applied within platform can yield
substantial savings, so efficiency

125
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:11,631
gains and competency advantages.

126
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:17,581
While working with RISE components,
there are common challenges, which arise.

127
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:20,841
I just want to, highlight it
here so that it will be helpful.

128
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:24,811
there are some common challenges
which may arise to the data quality

129
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:29,411
issues, the integration complexity
issues, integration complexity issues.

130
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:33,401
My slide is stuck.

131
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:38,926
Yeah, integration complexity
issues and performance optimization

132
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:40,836
are just a few to work on these.

133
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:42,966
So leverage Oracle documentation.

134
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:47,866
Engage with the Oracle community
and following the best practices.

135
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:49,966
there is a community with
Oracle, which is support.

136
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:50,516
oracle.

137
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:51,066
com.

138
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:55,096
you can always have your questions
posted or you can reach Oracle

139
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:56,636
for any, anything you wanted.

140
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:59,916
that depends on the agreement
you have with Oracle, like your

141
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:01,766
company or yourself with the Oracle.

142
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:05,686
yeah, it's always recommended to
follow best practices and, don't

143
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:10,006
have a clear strategy and structured
approach for anything you do, with

144
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,636
respect to a father is competent.

145
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:16,831
So so balance customization needs with
system maintainability and future upgrade.

146
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:20,576
So if you do something, if you follow
good processes and create something,

147
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:24,636
which is, which comes, under the Oracle
guidelines, it's easy to maintain the

148
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:27,636
future, and, some and, future upgrades.

149
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:28,846
Oracle Club is said.

150
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:31,861
Oracle Club have the system
twice a year, so it, it's.

151
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:36,841
It will be easy to maintain or
easy to, easy to, look at the

152
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:38,551
applications and, get it down time.

153
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:42,471
So platform engineering practices
thrive to on interactive

154
00:09:42,471 --> 00:09:43,211
iterative development cycles.

155
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:48,881
Leveraging agile methodologies for
wise customizations ensures faster

156
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:52,681
development, minimal downtime,
and adaptive platform solutions.

157
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:55,821
So that's one thing you
need to make it out of.

158
00:09:56,821 --> 00:10:03,387
yeah, I think, I hope you got an overview
of what Oracle RISE components are

159
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:08,711
and how important and critical they
are, for successful implementation

160
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:10,404
of, Enterprise Business Suite.

161
00:10:10,414 --> 00:10:14,924
the Oracle RISE frameworks will offer,
offers a powerful and flexible method

162
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:18,864
of customization e business suite,
allowing organizations to maximize.

163
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:24,324
Value of the ERP systems by leveraging
reports, interfaces, conversions and

164
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:28,884
extensions effectively businesses
can enhance system functionality,

165
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:31,554
optimize operations and reduce costs.
