00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,340
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,419
Thanks for joining me today at
Conf 42 Platform Engineering.

3
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:23,514
I hope you're having a good
time so far and learning a ton.

4
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:27,275
I know, myself, I'm definitely
learning from all the others.

5
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:29,275
Let's try to keep it going.

6
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:33,644
Today I want to share with you a
technique that is called pre martem

7
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:35,894
that can be used to hack the future.

8
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:38,334
But why should we care about that?

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,214
projects fail sometimes.

10
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:43,745
Maybe not yours, maybe you have
been lucky in your career so far

11
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:47,829
and none of the projects you've
worked on failed the project.

12
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:51,339
But it's quite a typical scenario.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,160
Most people have had failure in
the past, and while we don't like

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,220
that, it's something that do happen.

15
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,760
In fact, 74 percent of all IT
projects fail, depending on definition

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,490
of failure, obviously, and they
don't all end up burning in flame.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,370
Sometime it may be just some delays,
sometime could be some feature missing,

18
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:20,600
issues at the launch, and you have to
fix them in the firefighting for a few

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,260
weeks before it can come back to normal.

20
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:26,055
So you can deal with
failure when it happens.

21
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:30,165
Obviously, much better to prevent
the failure from happening in the

22
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:34,785
first place, or reducing the risk
of such failure as much as possible.

23
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:38,935
So the technique I want to share
with you, it's called a premortem.

24
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:40,365
Let's get into that.

25
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:41,465
What's a premortem?

26
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:48,635
It's actually a risk discovery
technique that you do as a group.

27
00:01:48,705 --> 00:01:50,565
So it's similar to a brainstorming.

28
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,580
It's really similar to a parse more temp,
actually, but we use a two step process.

29
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,400
First, we set up a scenario,
which is a hypothetical future,

30
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,900
where the project have failed.

31
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,080
So if your project launched,
for example, on May 4th,

32
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,530
that's how you would set it up.

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,780
You would, as a group, you
would say, we are now May 4th.

34
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,790
The project was launched last week.

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,260
It's a complete failure, whatever.

36
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,130
What should we do now?

37
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,270
How this, how did this happen?

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,320
That's what you asked yourself.

39
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,630
What did go wrong?

40
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,270
So it's really the same as a, post mortem.

41
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,220
You ask what went wrong and
why, but you do that before

42
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,770
the failure actually happening.

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,280
That's why it's also
similar to brainstorming.

44
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,940
You want to get a lot of, ideas out.

45
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:46,340
Using this framing, it's actually
prove, proven to increase the ability

46
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,170
to identify reason for future outcome.

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,820
So there's been studies on that
using this kind of framing.

48
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:58,575
better at that than just asking what could
go wrong without the framing around it.

49
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:03,215
So while it's simple to
do, as I've described, you

50
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,815
already know how to do that.

51
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:10,785
From my experience, there are some ways
that you can get more out of this process,

52
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:14,475
and there are also some things that if
you do, you will pretty much get nothing

53
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:17,435
out of it, or it even could cause harm.

54
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,710
to the project or your
company culture, anything.

55
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,720
So it's important to, do
some stuff correctly and some

56
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,750
stuff to not do it at all.

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,000
Let me share that with you
based on my own experience.

58
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:37,440
First thing is much better to have a small
team doing that, a small group setting.

59
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,300
Like much, pretty much all
brainstorming technique.

60
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,680
The bigger the group, the
less people will share.

61
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,170
also have less time for everybody.

62
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,570
It's time consuming if you
want everybody to talk.

63
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,570
So it's much better to do that
in a small group as possible.

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,160
That said, you want to also
have diversity of thought.

65
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,140
So you don't want to have only
like three DevOps engineer doing

66
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,460
that exercise because they will all
have most likely same perspective.

67
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,000
You will get less idea.

68
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,840
So again, similar to when you do.

69
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,975
brainstorming, you want to
have diversity of thought.

70
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:19,245
So different people, not too many, but
different people, different background,

71
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:23,405
different part of the company, as long
as they are relevant to the project.

72
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:26,375
So you could have a project manager,
you could have a salesperson,

73
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:31,195
potentially, you could have a engineer,
different people in engineering,

74
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:35,295
depending on what you are doing in
the project, try to have a variety.

75
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:38,055
So you get diversity of views.

76
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:41,125
That said, some don't.

77
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:42,485
So don't problem solve.

78
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:47,525
That's something I've seen often
and again, especially with engineer.

79
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:48,985
We like to solve problem.

80
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:50,285
That's basically our job.

81
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:52,035
Just solve problem all the time.

82
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:56,155
So as soon as somebody say
something, often you will have some

83
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:59,385
engineer that will go in and say
how we can prevent that problem.

84
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:01,395
You have to stop them right now.

85
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:05,065
Like you don't want to get into
a situation where you spend all

86
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:08,095
your time solving one problem.

87
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:13,145
what you want to do at this stage
is really just get as much problem

88
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:18,185
as possible, as much possible
risk, as much potential problem,

89
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:19,305
because they may not happen.

90
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:21,005
So you just want to get them out.

91
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:26,245
So you keep note of the problem, but
you prevent people from solving it.

92
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,495
It's not the right time.

93
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:31,315
we'll do that at the later stage
in the project life cycle, but

94
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:33,035
right now don't problem solve.

95
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:36,525
Also, don't reject anything.

96
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:37,485
Don't throw away.

97
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:39,875
That's a big issue.

98
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:43,855
Anytime you are brainstorming,
if you start to tell people their

99
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:48,595
idea is stupid, obviously they
will stay quiet and stop sharing.

100
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:49,885
So you don't want to do that.

101
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,505
You want to keep everything coming in.

102
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:52,835
Encourage.

103
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:54,075
Just list everything.

104
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:58,545
Something I've seen an example of
that at elsewhere, other, place.

105
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:03,045
Somebody said that cause of project
failure could be that the CEO

106
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:05,095
die before the project launch.

107
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:06,995
So that may seem forefetched.

108
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:11,125
Not sure what you can do about it as an
engineer or anybody on the team really.

109
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:15,885
Maybe you don't have to care about that,
but in any case, don't reject that.

110
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:16,475
Just list it.

111
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:18,705
Thank you, we can move on.

112
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:25,105
That said, instead of rejecting
if it's a too wide problem that is

113
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:27,905
raised, you can keep asking why.

114
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:32,575
So try to get deeper into the
problem to get more value out of it.

115
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:36,715
For example, if somebody says
that, maybe the project failed

116
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:39,485
because the server crashed.

117
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:42,515
you can ask more questions like,
what do you mean by server crash?

118
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:44,085
Was it like overloaded?

119
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:46,525
Was it actually a card that had an issue?

120
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:52,765
And, The server application failed,
was it too many users login at first,

121
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:57,915
too much account creation, like try to
get more and list them out, basically,

122
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:03,115
but don't, if you see that it is a
problem that is vague and high level,

123
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:06,735
and you could see that there could be
multiple reasons why this happened.

124
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:13,835
Then keep digging, ask why, so you can
get as many specific problems as possible.

125
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:22,355
Also, all along the journey, when you
do the primordium, at the beginning

126
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:27,285
and during it as well, remind people
what the goal is for this exercise.

127
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:32,695
So the goal is to gather ideas,
not solve them, no stupid

128
00:07:32,695 --> 00:07:34,365
ideas, all ideas are welcome.

129
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,619
The goal is to gather ideas.

130
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,070
a list of potential problems in
advance so we can act on them.

131
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,390
So sometime I've seen that, people
are getting pessimistic because

132
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,760
they just keep hearing about all
the way things can burn down.

133
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,420
so remind them that the purpose of
that is to list everything that could

134
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,069
happen, doesn't mean it will happen.

135
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,685
And hopefully thanks to this activity,
they will not happen because you Raise

136
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:05,555
the problem in advance so you can then
build your project plan or address that

137
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:12,075
anyway Later on but at least you are
better tooled To solve the problem.

138
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:16,025
So it's important to remind people
of that all along and also at the

139
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:20,655
end after everybody Brought all
the point you just remind them.

140
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:21,205
Thanks.

141
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:23,325
Now we have all these issue.

142
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:28,055
We much better suited to solve
the problem and not have a

143
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:30,930
project that failed So then what?

144
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,380
You've done that, you've spent a few
hours listing everything, you have a long

145
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,050
list of words and ideas and everything.

146
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,750
So from that, you need
to adjust your plan.

147
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,360
So the first thing is to group and clean
up all the items you have on that list.

148
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,250
So this possible that people you were
talking and they mentioned, basically

149
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,750
the same problem, different way.

150
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,930
So you could have different
way of saying the same thing.

151
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,470
You group them together.

152
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,430
you can try to like previous
example where you keep asking why.

153
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,830
So you may end up with a bunch
of problem or potential risk that

154
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,110
are different, but could result
in the same, behavior in the end.

155
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,450
So you may still want to group
them together, make it easier

156
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,330
to tackle and think about that.

157
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,274
So you group and clean up item.

158
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:25,295
If there are stuff, that were not clear,
or you don't remember, it's fine to go

159
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:27,015
back to the people that brought the idea.

160
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:31,755
If you remember, you can clarify, but the
goal is to have a clean list of items.

161
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:34,375
Then you assess the risk of each of them.

162
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:39,275
Again, if the risk is CEO could
die, maybe not much you can do

163
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:44,595
about it as an engineer, but also,
maybe that's not the biggest problem

164
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:46,475
that will come if the CEO dies.

165
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:47,565
Maybe it will not be.

166
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:53,925
project launch failed, the whole company
might be in jeopardy, so maybe, not

167
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:56,405
a big risk, for the project itself.

168
00:09:57,235 --> 00:10:01,305
some risks you may ignore, some risks
may be ready for fetch, so you have to

169
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:05,965
use your own judgment, talk with people,
see, like, how likely risks are, because

170
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:08,860
obviously, That's always the trade off.

171
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,590
If you prevent all the possible risks,
it will take forever to build that.

172
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:19,340
So you have to be strategic about
it and only address the most

173
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,660
likely risk that you've listed.

174
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:25,845
And then you share your risk
mitigation plan with everybody.

175
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:29,995
It's important to follow up with people
that did the exercise in the first place.

176
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:33,875
Of course, you can share with
whoever is relevant, but, to close

177
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,225
the loop with them, they were the
one that brought all the issues.

178
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:41,005
So it's good to follow up
with them saying, Hey, thanks

179
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:42,405
for participating in this.

180
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,575
We now have this big list of issues.

181
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,085
We grouped them, we've looked at them.

182
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:50,820
Here is the plan to address
the one that we deem to be most

183
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,160
likely are worth fixing for that.

184
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,530
It's possible to, say that,
this one is really unlikely.

185
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,900
We can solve later on.

186
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:04,190
Things like that, but to have a plan and
share it with people and how to address

187
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:09,370
that, this will well actually prevent the
project from failing from this scenario,

188
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,790
but also give more confidence, everybody
in the team about the chance of success.

189
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,185
So seeing that, Oh, We had
that big list of issues.

190
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:23,615
And yeah, I see that this
plan will address them.

191
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,585
We will have that person
work on this problem.

192
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:32,945
We are taking consideration about scaling
issue as we build the backend services.

193
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:35,105
like all this stuff will be in the plan.

194
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:39,045
So people will be much more
motivated about the project.

195
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,255
the morale will be higher.

196
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:45,815
So even just that in itself is
a benefit and you can prevent

197
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:49,545
failure just because people are
more optimistic about the outcome.

198
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:51,865
And that's pretty much that.

199
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:54,055
So thank you everyone for joining.

200
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:55,005
My name is Laurent.

201
00:11:55,565 --> 00:12:00,725
I'm happy to discuss further during the
conference in the networking, section.

202
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:04,495
And if you want to follow up
with me, stay in touch, happy to

203
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:06,605
chat about this and other stuff.

204
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:09,845
Thanks again and enjoy the
rest of the conference.
