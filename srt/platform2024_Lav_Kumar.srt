1
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,070
Good morning, good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:18,470
Thank you for joining me today.

3
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:22,000
I am excited to discuss how AI
and robotics are changing the

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,530
way we disassemble products,
which is a crucial step in making

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,000
our economy more sustainable.

6
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:34,255
By improving how we take products apart,
we can recover valuable materials, reduce

7
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:37,124
waste, and better protect our environment.

8
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:41,355
Let's start by understanding the
complexity of modern products.

9
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,879
Today's devices, such as smartphones,
laptops, and even cars, are

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,319
made from a mix of materials.

11
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:54,029
These include plastics, metals,
and rare elements, all of which

12
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:55,769
are tightly packed together.

13
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,859
For example, a single smartphone
contains over 60 different elements.

14
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,679
including precious metals like gold and
silver, as well as rare earth enamel.

15
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,869
These are critical for its electronics.

16
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,039
Because these materials are so
tightly integrated, it's hard to

17
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,859
separate them once the product
reaches the end of its life.

18
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:22,720
The complexity often leads to valuable
components being discarded, which not

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,080
only causes economy losses, but also
harms the environment by increasing waste.

20
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:32,535
The challenge we face is how to
effectively assemble these products

21
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:35,285
to recover the materials inside.

22
00:01:36,774 --> 00:01:39,264
This is where AI and robotics come in.

23
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:44,034
By making the assembly process more
efficient, we can recover more materials

24
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:46,694
and reduce the impact on the environment.

25
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:51,695
The approach helps keep valuable
materials in use and minimize

26
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,955
the need of new raw material,
which often require environmental

27
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:57,875
damaging extraction processes.

28
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:57,935
Thank you.

29
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,640
Now let's talk about importance
of efficient assembly.

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,010
Research has shown that up to 80 percent
of a product's environment impact is

31
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,970
determined at the stage of design.

32
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,019
This means that how we design
products plays a huge role in

33
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,489
their overall sustainability.

34
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:23,850
But even with the best design, we will
still need efficient assembly processes to

35
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,360
reclaim and recycle materials effectively.

36
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,240
Consider the example of electronic device.

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,740
batteries.

38
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:36,160
These batteries are made up of
various valuable materials, including

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,830
lithium, cobalt, and nickel.

40
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,870
If we can efficiently disassemble
these batteries, we can recover

41
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:47,470
these materials and reuse them in
new batteries or other products.

42
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:52,819
These, this reduces the need for
mining, which is often associated with

43
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:59,015
significant environmental damage, such as
habitat destruction and water pollution.

44
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:02,154
To achieve this advanced
AI robotics are essential.

45
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:06,625
AI can analyze the structure and material
composition of a material in real

46
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:12,165
time, figuring out the best way to take
it apart from damaging the material.

47
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:18,081
Robotics guided by this AI can
then execute the disassembly with

48
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:22,335
precision, ensuring that each
component is carefully removed.

49
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:26,135
For instance, robots can be equipped
with sensors that detect the type

50
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:30,565
of material they are handling,
allowing them to adjust their grip or

51
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:31,944
cutting techniques to avoid damage.

52
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:33,364
damaging the materials.

53
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:37,605
This combination of AI and robotics
makes it possible to recover

54
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:39,265
more material with less waste.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,090
which is critical for moving toward
a circular economy where products and

56
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,440
material are reused as much as possible.

57
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,519
Now, let's talk about AI
and robotics in disassembly.

58
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,999
Let's explore how, AI and robotics are
transforming the disassembly processes,

59
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:03,810
advanced AI system, particularly those
based GPT are capable of analyzing

60
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,730
complex product design and determining the
most efficient way to disassemble them.

61
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,400
For example, AI can help identify
different types of screws, fasteners,

62
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,320
and adhesives used in electronics, which
are often difficult to remove without

63
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,810
damaging the surrounding components with
the help of machine learning algorithms.

64
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,750
Robots can be trained to recognize
these different elements and use the

65
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,730
appropriate tools to remove them.

66
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:31,639
This capability is crucial in
industries like electronics recycling,

67
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,619
where preserving the integrity of
components such as circuit boards and

68
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:37,279
processors is vital for their use.

69
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:43,890
Industries that have adopted AI driven
assembly have seen a significant increase

70
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,290
in the retrieval of usable components.

71
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,820
For instance, some companies reported
a 30 percent increase in the amount of

72
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,960
valuable materials they can recover.

73
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,620
This aesthetics, it's a has
real world implication for both

74
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,060
economy and the environment.

75
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,929
By recovering more materials, companies
can reduce their reliance on new

76
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,949
raw materials, which often come with
high environment and financial cost.

77
00:05:13,369 --> 00:05:16,710
Another example in cycling of
automotive parts where AI driven

78
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,440
system can disassemble components
like engine and transmission.

79
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,650
with a level of precision that minimizes
waste and maximize the recovery of

80
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,620
metals such as aluminum and steel.

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,440
These materials can then be modified
down and reused in new products,

82
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,720
reducing the need of energy
intensive mining and processing.

83
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:44,680
The impact of integrating AI
and robotics into disassembling

84
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,860
processes is substantial.

85
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,070
These technologies not only reduce the
environmental footprint of products,

86
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:56,534
We use every day, but also support the
broader goals of a circular economy.

87
00:05:56,555 --> 00:06:00,694
For example, companies that have
implemented EINR's disassembly

88
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:04,355
report up to a 50 percent
improvement in metal recovery rates.

89
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:07,834
This improvement has several
important implications.

90
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:12,155
First, it reduces the need for
extracting new raw material,

91
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:16,125
which is often associated with
significant environmental degradation.

92
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:20,174
Mining for materials like copper,
gold, and lithium, for example,

93
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:25,184
can lead to deforestation, soil
erosion, and water pollution.

94
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:29,074
Second, better material recovery
means that more of these materials

95
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:30,684
can be reused in new products.

96
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:34,935
reducing the overall demand
for virgin materials.

97
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:39,395
This is not only conserves natural
resources, but also lowers the

98
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:42,895
carbon footprint associated with
the production of new materials.

99
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:48,835
For instance, recycling aluminum saves
up to 95 percent of the energy required

100
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:52,145
to produce new aluminum from raw bauxite.

101
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:56,645
AI also helps improve the
sorting of materials during

102
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:57,855
the disassembly processes.

103
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,914
ensuring that the cycling
products are higher quality.

104
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:07,784
For example, AI systems can identify and
separate different type of plastic based

105
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:13,184
on their chemical composition, ensuring
that recycled plastics are pure enough to

106
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:18,495
be used in high quality applications such
as automotive or construction industry.

107
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,355
Despite this advancement, we
still face several challenges

108
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:24,895
in current assembly practices.

109
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,030
One major challenge is high
rate of resources wastage with

110
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,670
inefficient recycling methods.

111
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,429
Traditional recycling methods,
such as shredding, often mix

112
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:39,489
materials together, making it
difficult to separate them for use.

113
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,159
This combination can significantly
reduce the value of recycled materials.

114
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,929
For example, when electronics are
shredded, metals and plastic can

115
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:52,349
become mixed together, making it
difficult to separate them later.

116
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:52,357
ha.

117
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:57,847
This not only reduces the efficiency of
recycling processes, but also results in

118
00:07:57,847 --> 00:08:01,217
more materials being sent to landfills.

119
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:05,727
Additionally, many products are not
designed with disassembly in mind, which

120
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,437
make the recycling process even harder.

121
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:12,987
For instance, some products use glue and
adhesive that make it nearly impossible to

122
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:15,447
separate components without damaging them.

123
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:19,147
EIN Robotics offers solutions to
these problems by automatically.

124
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:24,957
processes and using intelligent
separate materials more efficiently.

125
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:30,937
For example, AI can optimize the order
in which components are removed, ensuring

126
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:35,617
that valuable materials are recovered
without being missed or contaminated.

127
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:40,217
In addition, robots can be equipped
with advanced tools that can carefully

128
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:44,957
cut or unscrew components without
damaging the material, further improving

129
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,047
the quality of recovered material.

130
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:54,587
To see how these technologies
work in practice, let's look

131
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:55,807
at some real world examples.

132
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,787
In one case study, it is cycling.

133
00:08:57,932 --> 00:09:06,262
The robots were equipped with additional
vision systems and machine learning

134
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:10,512
algorithms that allowed them to
identify and remove valuable components

135
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:14,992
such as processors, memory chips,
and batteries with great precision.

136
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:19,192
This led to a 40 percent increase in
the recovery of valuable materials,

137
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:23,152
which were then sold back to
manufacturing for use in new products.

138
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:29,017
Another example comes from the
automotive industry, where an AI

139
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:34,657
guided systems are used to disassemble
electric vehicle batteries.

140
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:38,087
The system was able to carefully
separate the different materials,

141
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:42,677
including lithium, cobalt, and
nickel, with minimal contamination.

142
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:47,267
This not only reduced the cost of
recycling, but also ensured that

143
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:51,107
the recovered materials were of
high enough quality to be used.

144
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:52,972
in new batteries.

145
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:57,252
This type of closed loop recycling
system is essential for reducing

146
00:09:57,252 --> 00:10:01,852
the environmental impact of battery
production and supporting the growth

147
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:03,752
of the electric vehicle market.

148
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:09,602
These cases study shows that how AI
and robotics are not just theoretically

149
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:13,062
concept, they are practically
solutions that are already making

150
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:14,462
a difference in the real world.

151
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,112
By adopting these technologies, companies
can improve their sustainability effort,

152
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:23,117
and they can while also benefiting
economically from the recovery

153
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,897
and reuse of valuable materials.

154
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:33,017
Looking to the future, AI enhanced
assembly is set to play an even

155
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:37,167
bigger role in making manufacturing
and recycling more sustainable.

156
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:42,527
As these technologies continue
to advance, they will be able to

157
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:46,227
handle a wide range of products
and materials more efficiently.

158
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:50,987
For example, future AI systems
Could analyze the composition of

159
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,377
material in real time, allowing
even more precise disassembly.

160
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:59,027
This could be particularly useful in
industries like electronics, where

161
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:03,607
the rapid race of technological change
means the new materials and designs

162
00:11:03,657 --> 00:11:05,467
are constantly being introduced.

163
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:11,317
Additionally, advance in robotics could
lead to the development of new tools and

164
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:16,397
technologies for disassembly products
that are currently too complex or

165
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:18,987
labor intensive to recycle efficiently.

166
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:23,562
Ultimately, the goal is to create
a circular economy where methods

167
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:28,902
are continuously used and basis
minimize the vision of sustainable

168
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:30,782
future is within our reach.

169
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:35,772
Thanks to the advancement in AI and
robotics by continuing to innovate

170
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:39,712
and integrate these technologies,
