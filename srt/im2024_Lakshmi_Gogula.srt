00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:00,840
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,550
I am Gurgula, and I specialize
in aligning technology solutions

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,060
with business objectives.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,249
I will be speaking on digitalizing SAP
HR, migrating legacy systems to a secure,

5
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,649
theory based, user centric experience.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,320
If you are looking to modernize
your legacy HR services, this

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,910
talk would be really helpful.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,229
Digitalizing SAP HR services,
migrating legacy systems to a secure

9
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,740
theory based user centric experience.

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,580
Before we proceed with the migration
talk, I have a disclaimer to share.

11
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:44,850
The views and opinions expressed
in this presentation are my own.

12
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,320
and do not represent the views
or official position of my

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,230
current and previous employers.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,579
The content is based on general
industrial knowledge and

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,260
publicly available information.

16
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,450
No confidential information
will be shared during the talk.

17
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:05,710
A little bit about my background.

18
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:12,660
I tailor technology to fit business
needs perfectly with a robust skill set

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:19,524
in SAP advanced capability in SAP ABAP,
WebDN for ABAP, Gateway OData services,

20
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:24,329
SAP UFI, Fiori, SAP BTP development,
as well as comprehensive workflows.

21
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:28,789
I have transformed challenging
IT issues to streamline user

22
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,469
friendly automated solutions.

23
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:38,839
This topic is divided into introduction,
objective, modernizing legacy SAP HR

24
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:46,939
systems, transitioning to Fiori, advanced
security integrations, optimizing SAP HR

25
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:53,849
process for efficiency, enhancing data
integrations, ensuring compatibility

26
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:01,154
with modern web browsers, innovations,
And conclusion introduction, the rapid

27
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:08,554
evolution of technology demands that HR
systems undergo significant transformation

28
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,394
to meet the needs of modern organization.

29
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:19,984
Legacy SAP HR systems often struggle
with outdated interfaces, slow processing

30
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:22,044
times, and a lack of mobile access.

31
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:25,964
which hinder productivity
and user satisfaction.

32
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:33,554
These systems are also prone to security
vulnerabilities, making it difficult to

33
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:36,404
comply with current security standards.

34
00:02:37,844 --> 00:02:44,875
The project is focused on resolving issues
by migrating SAP HR process to a Fiori.

35
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:50,979
based user interface, which will
provide a secure, responsive,

36
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,309
and intuitive user experience.

37
00:02:55,309 --> 00:03:00,739
The digital transformation will modernize
the system, streamline workflows,

38
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:04,519
and enhance overall efficiency.

39
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:11,309
Let's break down what we mean by Some
of the specific issues faced by users

40
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:14,989
outdated user interfaces.

41
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:19,539
The interfaces were often
designed decades ago with a little

42
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,559
consideration for user experience.

43
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:26,119
Navigating these systems can be
confusing, leading to mistakes.

44
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:29,529
Slow system performance.

45
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:34,489
Critical processes like recruitment,
onboarding, and performance

46
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:35,989
evolutions are slowed down.

47
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:42,189
This not only impacts HR teams,
but also has a knock on effect on

48
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,809
employees who rely on the same systems.

49
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,085
Security vulnerabilities.

50
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:55,224
Older systems lack the built in security
measures, That we expect from modern

51
00:03:55,224 --> 00:04:01,964
software as data breaches become
more common and more costly lack of

52
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:04,594
mobile access in an increasingly.

53
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:11,529
The remote and mobile workforce, HR
systems that can be accessed only from an

54
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,469
office desktop are no longer sufficient.

55
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:20,959
Employees and HR teams need to access
these systems from anywhere, whether they

56
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,419
are in office, at home, or traveling.

57
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,279
Business impact.

58
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:29,479
All of these technical
problems have real old history.

59
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,149
Implications for the business.

60
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:38,109
For one, employee engagement can
suffer when people have to deal

61
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,079
with the slow, inefficient systems.

62
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,269
They lose confidence in the company's
operations and it affects morale.

63
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,919
Delay processing like recruitment,
talent acquisition, and performance

64
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:57,709
reviews leads to dissatisfaction
and even push the top talent away.

65
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,099
Then there is an issue of security.

66
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:07,769
Finally, inefficient systems results
in higher operational cost when

67
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:12,829
HR professionals spend more time
managing the system inefficiencies.

68
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:19,069
It increases the manual effort and
resources required to maintain operations.

69
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:27,964
This isn't scalable as business grows
transitioning from legacy systems

70
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:35,254
modernizing These systems is critical
digital transformation is no longer

71
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:41,774
optional It's about staying competitive
improving Efficiencies and positioning

72
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:48,824
hr function to meet future challenges
sap theory That presents a cutting

73
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,764
edge solution to these problems.

74
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:56,654
We are designed to be intuitive, mobile
friendly, and secure, solving many

75
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:57,944
of the issues we have highlighted.

76
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:00,164
Objectives.

77
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:07,299
objective is to migrate SAP HR
services from legacy system to

78
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,779
a Fiori based user interface.

79
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:18,874
The key goals of this migration
includes security, and ensuring

80
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:23,634
compliance with industry standards,
improving user experience through a

81
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:30,014
modern UI, responsive UI, creating self
explanatory forms that can streamline

82
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:31,914
process and reduce training time,

83
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:37,704
enhancements.

84
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:42,424
One of the most pressing
objectives is security.

85
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:48,124
In today's digital transformation or
digital landscape, where data breaches are

86
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:52,294
on the rise, companies are under immense
pressure to safeguard employees data.

87
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:58,004
Legacy systems built in an era when
data security was far less of a

88
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:02,634
concern do not meet the stringent
security protocols needed today.

89
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:07,694
This makes them vulnerable to breaches,
which can result in significant

90
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:09,924
damage to a company's reputation.

91
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:15,994
SAP Fiori, on the other hand,
incorporates advanced security protocols.

92
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:19,184
Let's look at a few.

93
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:25,864
Data Encryption Fiori ensures
the sensitive data is encrypted

94
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:28,314
both in transit and at rest.

95
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:34,574
This means that even if the data were
intercepted, it would be unreadable

96
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,189
without the encryption keys.

97
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,449
Multi factor authentication.

98
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:43,949
This adds an extra layer of security
by requiring users to verify their

99
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:46,939
identity using more than just a password.

100
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,519
It drastically reduces the risk of
unauthorized access to sensitive

101
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,189
role based access controls.

102
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:03,109
Not everyone needs to do the, needs
to do the same level of information.

103
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:06,299
Not everyone needs to access
the same level of information.

104
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:11,219
Theory ensures that only
authorized personnel can access

105
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:14,409
or modify certain types of data.

106
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:19,149
This is critical for ensuring compliance
with data protection laws like GDPR.

107
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:23,849
Compliance with regulations like
GDPR is no longer optional for

108
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:25,359
companies handling personal data.

109
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:29,929
GDPR enforces strict rules
about how personal data is

110
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:31,989
collected, stored, and used.

111
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:35,289
Non compliance can result
in significant penalties.

112
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:40,419
Fiori architecture is designed
with compliance in mind, ensuring

113
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,859
that HR processes automatically
adhere to these regulations,

114
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,569
avoiding the risk of penalties.

115
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:51,859
User Interface Improved User Interface

116
00:08:53,974 --> 00:08:57,644
Another primary objective is
improving the user experience.

117
00:08:57,824 --> 00:09:03,034
Fiori offers a responsive and
user friendly interface that

118
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:06,754
works seamlessly across the
desktop, tablets, mobile devices.

119
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:11,805
This modernization significantly
enhances the user experience

120
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:14,024
for both HR staff and employees.

121
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:20,424
For an example, HR staff can
onboard new employees quickly

122
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:22,274
without needing extensive training.

123
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:27,689
Employees can easily access their
personal HR information, apply for leave,

124
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:31,679
or update their details without having
to navigate through confusing menus.

125
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:38,109
Self explanatory forms theory also
introduces self explanatory forms,

126
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:44,394
which guide users through complex,
Process ensuring that they enter the

127
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,274
right information in the correct format.

128
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:53,844
This reduces the need of for
constant HR support cuts down on

129
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:58,284
errors, minimizing the amount of
time users spend on each task.

130
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:03,854
Think about how a form designed to
process a benefit application might

131
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:08,924
prompt user only the relevant information
based on their previous selections.

132
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,834
This kind of smart interactions
reduce the complexity of data

133
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:16,934
entry, leading to fewer mistakes.

134
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,439
And quicker task completion.

135
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:22,859
User centered design.

136
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:29,209
Another key aspect of Fiori in
its, is its user centered design.

137
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:35,539
In past, many HR systems were designed
with the assumption that users would be

138
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:37,959
willing to deal with complex workforce.

139
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,479
Fiori flipped this.

140
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:46,614
Making the interface simple,
intuitive, and focused on the

141
00:10:46,684 --> 00:10:49,064
tasks that users actually perform.

142
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:54,464
For instance, processes like
employee onboarding are now

143
00:10:54,464 --> 00:11:00,094
streamlined and HR manager can
initiate the onboarding process.

144
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:04,864
And the new employee can complete
the forms, upload the documents,

145
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,124
and even start training directly
from their mobile devices.

146
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:10,124
Use case.

147
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:12,084
Employee onboarding.

148
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:14,304
Let's consider a real world example.

149
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:18,084
Imagine a new hire joining in
your organization using Fiori.

150
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:24,474
The HR teams can initiate onboarding
process with just a few clicks.

151
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:29,519
The new employee, on the other
hand, can receive the welcome

152
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,159
email that directs them to a
mobile friendly platform, Portal.

153
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:38,269
There they can submit the required
documentation, signed forms, complete

154
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,239
training modules, all without ever
needing to step into the office.

155
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:50,074
This approach not only saves time,
but also ensures a smooth, stress free

156
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:52,954
onboarding experience for new employees.

157
00:11:53,794 --> 00:11:55,574
transitioning to SAP Theory.

158
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:57,784
SAP Theory

159
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:06,764
often offers a modern, intuitive
experience, a consistent user

160
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:08,444
experience across all the devices.

161
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:12,414
desktops, tablets, smartphones, Fiori

162
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:21,784
responsive design ensures that user
can access process from any device,

163
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:25,574
increasing flexibility and engagement.

164
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:30,684
Self explanatory forms created with
Fiori reduce the complexity of data

165
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:36,694
entry, improves user satisfaction,
and ensures higher productivity.

166
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:38,164
Fiori

167
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:47,594
Responsive Design One of the standout
features of Fiori is mobile first design.

168
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:52,414
Today, we are moving away from
traditional office based work environment.

169
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:57,324
More employees are working
remotely or in a hybrid model.

170
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:02,284
And they need to be able to access
HR systems no matter where they are.

171
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,194
This is where Fiori shines.

172
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:11,914
Its responsive design ensures
that same user experience is

173
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:13,684
available across all the devices.

174
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:19,694
Whether you are in a desktop computer,
a tablet, or a smartphone, the

175
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:23,424
flexibility is very crucial for HR
professionals who are on the go.

176
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:28,094
For instance, a HR manager who is
attending an out of office meeting can

177
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:33,925
still log in to approve a leave request
or review a performance report directly

178
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:37,674
from their smartphones or tablet.

179
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:43,974

00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:56,564
Think of an employee trying to apply
for a leave while traveling or HR

182
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:59,994
professional who needs to conduct
a performance review from a tablet.

183
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:05,279
Fiori ensures that the experience is
seamless across all the platforms.

184
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:12,749
Employees don't need to wait until
they're back in office to complete tasks.

185
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:19,319
