1
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,040
I am Chris Gallivan.

2
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,060
I work for PlanView as a flow advisor.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,100
I've been looking for flow for
the past three years along with my

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,679
clients, and I've learned a ton.

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,679
And today I want to share with you
some of the learnings we've had

6
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:29,270
along with our clients as we look
for flow in large organizations.

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,940
Before we, we talk about, where to find
flow, where people are looking for flow.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,010
I think we should define flow
because I don't think we all

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,429
have the same definition.

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,059
It's not even obvious to me sometimes.

11
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:44,749
So since it's 2024, I figured
we would ask you at GPT.

12
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:48,769
The first time I asked you at GPT what
flow is, it came back with the answer

13
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:54,969
that was the industry definition of
flow in terms of a state of being.

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:01,940
So this is that idea that a person could
be in flow Where they're performing

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,880
their best, where they can do no wrong.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Anyone who's ever been an athlete
or a musician hopefully has

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,680
felt this at some point in time.

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,530
You have good days and you have bad days.

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,430
Sometimes you have this really
good day where you can do no wrong.

20
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:18,055
That is what we mean by flow
in the first definition.

21
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:24,565
However, when I work with my clients,
generally a different definition of flow.

22
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:30,114
What I generally mean is this
idea that we could bring valuable

23
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:32,215
software to users faster.

24
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,374
And how do we do that?

25
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:35,925
And that's the second
definition on the right.

26
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:37,345
So which one is it?

27
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:40,755
Is it the first definition or
is it the second definition?

28
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:44,275
From my perspective,
the answer is it's both.

29
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:45,864
If you think about it.

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,400
You can't actually be in
flow as an individual and not

31
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,700
produce something of value.

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,889
If you can do no wrong, that means
that your instincts are right,

33
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,320
you're thinking very clearly,
you're thinking about your customer.

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,720
That's, I think that's always going to
produce faster value for your customer.

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,590
And on the other hand, if you, in order to
get your organization truly bringing value

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,980
sooner to customers across the board,
you have to enable flow for your people.

37
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,170
If your people don't feel it,
they're not going to do it.

38
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:19,525
So you need both.

39
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:21,145
I think the answer is both.

40
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:23,725
So now that we've defined
it why do people want flow?

41
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:28,344
What is it about flow that,
that is attractive to people?

42
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:32,295
Why is everyone talking about
this for the past few years?

43
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:36,505
There's a lot of reasons why pretty
obvious, but the reason that I think

44
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:40,415
we're really interested in it is that I
think as humans we're fixated on time.

45
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:43,264
From the moment we're born
we're always chasing time.

46
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,150
We never have enough time.

47
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,060
We always want to do more
with the time we have.

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,880
So I think there's something about us
that, that's always looking for flow.

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,829
And that's why I think it, it's something
that resonates with so many people.

50
00:02:57,029 --> 00:03:01,529
The thing about time that's
interesting is a lot of times we try

51
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,409
to think of time as counting time.

52
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:07,739
So we count the amount of time we spent on
something and we want to shrink that time.

53
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:12,329
But when you really look at time,
not all time has equal value.

54
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:17,514
So in this example, the first picture
is a picture I love, that's my youngest

55
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:21,094
daughter and I was making pizza with
her and I was so caught up in the

56
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:25,454
moment that I didn't realize the way
that she was experiencing that moment

57
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,014
and the picture kind of captures it.

58
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:30,324
It was priceless and it was
about 10 minutes of my life.

59
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:35,414
The second picture is a picture of my
pizza oven that my wife and I built

60
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:40,124
together and it took three summers, so it
took a significant larger amount of time.

61
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:42,734
They both mean a lot to me.

62
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:46,339
But I think you would understand
clearly the first one means more.

63
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:50,219
So just because something takes more
time doesn't mean that it means more.

64
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,259
Not all time has equal value.

65
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,309
There's a book called
Saving Time by Jenny O'Dell.

66
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:59,509
And in it Jenny says, Time has felt the
most expansive and I have felt the most

67
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:03,409
alive when I was in an encounter with
something or someone that was surprising.

68
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:06,059
Something that I didn't
necessarily expect.

69
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,959
And this is similar to the last slide.

70
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,399
This is basically this idea
that time has a quality to it.

71
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:14,219
There's good time, there's bad time.

72
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,849
And what makes something a good time?

73
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:18,379
Often it's something that
happened that you didn't expect.

74
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:19,749
Something surprising.

75
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:21,269
Something where you learn something.

76
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:26,699
It turns out that you feel the most
energized when you create your best

77
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,289
work in the shortest amount of time.

78
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:33,989
So that's the idea behind Flow
and why I think Flow is exciting.

79
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:40,349
A lot of our thoughts today are influenced
by things that happened before us.

80
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:43,989
So if we're going to talk about
where people look for Flow,

81
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,819
And where do they find flow?

82
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,519
I thought we would take it
back to the industrial age.

83
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:52,249
Cause I think some of the way we think
today came from the industrial age.

84
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:57,719
So back in 1909, Frederick Taylor, most
of you have probably heard of Frederick.

85
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:02,799
He published the principles of scientific
management, and these are four of his

86
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:06,569
principles that he published at that
time, discover the most efficient way

87
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:09,279
to perform tasks that makes sense.

88
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,929
Everyone wants to be efficient.

89
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,879
I'm sure they still want
to be efficient today.

90
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:15,844
Clearly defied responsibilities.

91
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:20,794
Not quite sure what he meant by that, but
on the surface, it seems to make sense.

92
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,024
Pay according to performance.

93
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:26,934
I think we all work in companies
where we're paid according to our

94
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:30,014
performance, we would all want to be
paid according to our performance.

95
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:34,184
I think rigid hierarchy and
strict surveillance of employees.

96
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:35,554
That one kind of stands out.

97
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:36,854
I don't think many people.

98
00:05:37,544 --> 00:05:40,224
Would want to work somewhere where
there was a rigid hierarchy and

99
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:41,904
strict surveillance of their work.

100
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:46,214
If you read a little bit more about
Taylor, my take on Taylor is he's the

101
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:48,184
guy who invented the manager role.

102
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,774
The actual role of managers.

103
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:55,504
I think it came from Taylor and he also
invented, it seems, the consultant role.

104
00:05:55,674 --> 00:06:00,374
I think that also comes from Taylor's
thinking and also racy charts.

105
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,104
And I'm sure there's many other
things that came from Taylor.

106
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:08,399
My take on him is that he had a tremendous
influence on the way people work

107
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,369
over the past hundred years or more.

108
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,559
I want to drill in a little bit to one
of his principles and it's this idea of

109
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,720
dividing the work from the responsibility.

110
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:21,600
This is a quote from Taylor,
which I found shocking.

111
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,900
In most cases, one type of man is
needed to plan ahead and an entirely

112
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,700
different type to execute the work.

113
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,830
The fact that he uses the word man is
a little bit offensive to many people.

114
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,770
But even the concept is a little offensive
because it suggests that only certain

115
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,640
type of people are fit for planning
and the rest are fit for working.

116
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,160
And I think, now that I think
about it, my career, I've been

117
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,650
working now for over 30 years.

118
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,310
A lot of the thoughts of the people
that I've come across, I think,

119
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,910
have been influenced by some of
these ways of thinking, and I

120
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,310
challenge these ways of thinking.

121
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,240
Out of Taylor's work, a simplistic view
of an organization has emerged, and it

122
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,860
still remains in many parts of the world.

123
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,010
This idea that we have this tower, and in
the tower sit the management, and then in

124
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,800
the rest of the company sit the workers.

125
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,400
In this sort of two step company.

126
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,080
I challenge this concept.

127
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:24,325
So that's that's the industrial
age, but I think it would make sense

128
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:28,765
that we also spin forward to the
digital age and evaluate, how do we

129
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:30,535
think about flow in the digital age?

130
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,574
You can see that many of our thoughts
have been influenced by the past.

131
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:34,995
If I think if you're like me,

132
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:40,395
so we're a hundred years past Taylor,
actually more than a hundred years.

133
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:43,785
And I've asked some managers
that are clients of mine, why

134
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:45,075
do you think work is delayed?

135
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:46,445
So you want to improve flow.

136
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,744
Why do you think flow is getting held up?

137
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,540
And here's some of the
answers that came back to me.

138
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,920
Inefficient processes, so we
have processes that aren't

139
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,990
as good as they could be.

140
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,719
We have unproductive people.

141
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:00,120
That's interesting.

142
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,509
I think they mean unproductive
workers when they say that.

143
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,080
We have people not following the process.

144
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,340
Okay, so that's a case where the process
isn't bad, but people aren't following it.

145
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,350
And then we have this one,
which is one of my favorites.

146
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,740
People taking on too much whip.

147
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,340
Suggesting that people actually are
doing it to themselves, and they just

148
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,500
need to lay off taking on too much work.

149
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,530
I think you can see from these four, four,
these are the four primary answers I got

150
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,390
when I asked this question to managers.

151
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:37,430
These are almost directly attributable to
Taylor's scientific management principles.

152
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,970
It's amazing how closely they match.

153
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,700
If you're looking for these things, if
it's not evident, I don't think this

154
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,780
is where you're going to find flow.

155
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:50,205
So there's this thing called the
spotlight, the streetlight effect, or the

156
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:54,205
spotlight effect and the picture shows
it here, and I think a lot of managers

157
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:56,645
and many of us fall into this trap.

158
00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:00,635
The picture shows a police officer
asking someone who's on the

159
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:03,025
ground, did you lose your keys?

160
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,585
And it's under this big streetlight.

161
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:09,515
And the person says, yeah, I lost them
over there, but the light's better here.

162
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:15,005
So the way I take this, it's the idea
that we measure what's easy to measure.

163
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,325
We don't always measure what we need
to measure or what we should measure.

164
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:20,155
We measure what's easy to measure.

165
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:23,645
And as a result we often wind
up getting false signals.

166
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:24,824
We measure the wrong thing.

167
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:31,005
So if you take that idea and you think
about the last 30 years and where

168
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:34,645
we've tried to shine the light and
make improvements we had the agile

169
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,755
revolution started over 30 years ago.

170
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,380
And then we had the DevOps revolution.

171
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,370
Maybe that started 10 years ago or so.

172
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,390
And basically what that did is it shined
a light on a piece of the value stream.

173
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,970
An important piece, but a piece.

174
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:53,070
As a result, we have lots of ways of
measuring this piece of the value stream.

175
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,270
We've made a lot of
improvements to this area.

176
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,000
But the natural question is, what
about the rest of the process?

177
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,900
When you look at where time actually
goes, if you were thinking like a

178
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,780
customer, You make a request, and
then it comes in 120 days, 100 Plus

179
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,750
20 plus 50 under 90 days later.

180
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,530
You get your request fulfilled.

181
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,750
So yeah, good job IT You sped
up the last 70, but what about

182
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,900
the first hundred and twenty?

183
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,959
What's going on there?

184
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:26,639
In order for us to really go after
that and understand it We need to put a

185
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,740
streetlight there and we need to start
measuring there and try to understand What

186
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,380
can we do to speed up that part of the
process after all that is the longest?

187
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,310
Amount of time that's
elapsed in this example.

188
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,360
So just like I asked the managers,
why do they think work is delayed?

189
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,090
I asked the same question to the workers.

190
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,300
Sometimes these are
developers and Skrull masters.

191
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,000
Why do you think work gets delayed?

192
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,879
And the top answers are on the board.

193
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:54,399
These are some of the answers
that came back from those folks

194
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:57,789
were working on the wrong things.

195
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:00,139
So we're not even working
on the important things.

196
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:03,259
We've got too many disparate
demands coming at us from different

197
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:04,519
parts of the organization.

198
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:04,559
in.

199
00:11:05,924 --> 00:11:09,684
We've got scope creep, so we ask,
they ask for one thing, we implement

200
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:13,884
it, then they ask for something else,
and it's slightly different, and

201
00:11:13,884 --> 00:11:15,374
then we have too many number ones.

202
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:22,444
I think you can see, if I ask a role in
that two, two role simplistic view of

203
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:24,614
an organization, where's the problem?

204
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:28,134
The problem's never in
the person I'm asking.

205
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:30,564
The problem's always
someone else's problem.

206
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:32,414
Someone else is doing a bad job.

207
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:35,474
I came from both sides
of this in my career.

208
00:11:36,064 --> 00:11:41,334
And in my, certainly from the worker
side or the development side, my response

209
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:43,594
to their answers here is poor babies.

210
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:46,804
I think that's an immature thing
to do, point to leadership.

211
00:11:48,544 --> 00:11:53,954
See, the thing is essentially what IT
or what the workers are saying is I

212
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:58,494
can't keep up and it needs you to dial
back the demand so that I can keep up.

213
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:01,944
And while there might be some
truth in that, I think there

214
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:03,304
is actually some truth in that.

215
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:07,144
I've never met one business
person that I could say that to.

216
00:12:07,164 --> 00:12:08,904
And they said, sure,
I'll dial back to work.

217
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:13,894
Actually I might've met one, but in
general, that's not a good approach.

218
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:16,434
If we need to dial back to work,
we got to figure out a better

219
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:18,014
way, a better message to send.

220
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:23,884
I think in general, those of us who have
been involved in the Agile and DevOps

221
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:27,284
revolution, we've allowed ourselves
to become task focused over the past.

222
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:32,314
15, 20 years instead of value focused,
I think agile started off focused on

223
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:37,014
value, focused on customers and what
our customers need and how can we make

224
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:42,714
customers lives better, but somewhere
along the line, we became much more

225
00:12:42,714 --> 00:12:45,704
focused on the work itself and the
tasks that we're doing instead of

226
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:47,395
the value that we bring to the world.

227
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:52,755
And when we go far enough
in this state, we eventually

228
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:55,114
become comfortably numb in red.

229
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:57,759
This is a quote from Domenico de Grandis.

230
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,500
It's basically that type of person, and
I know you've met people like this, I've

231
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,140
met people like this, I've even been
like this, I think, at points in my life,

232
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:10,749
where someone comes to me with some new
change that's going to make things better,

233
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:15,129
and my response is pessimism, apathy.

234
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:18,809
I've tried all these things before,
none of them work, this will

235
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:22,379
never work, is the response that
you get from this type of person.

236
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:26,969
And a lot of these people are
people that we work with every day.

237
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:31,354
The question I always have for
someone like that is, Are you

238
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:32,804
sure you tried the right things?

239
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:35,654
I know you tried some things,
but were they the right things?

240
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:39,214
Often times when I ask that question,
I find that there was something a

241
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:41,214
little bit wrong with what they tried.

242
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:48,044
So now that we've talked a
little bit about, How do we think

243
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,615
the way we think about flow?

244
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:51,465
And how did we get here?

245
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:56,055
Let's just examine quickly some places
that I find people looking for flow.

246
00:13:56,525 --> 00:14:00,414
So some corporations focus
extensively on features.

247
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:02,885
They move from one feature
to the next, and they have a

248
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,685
huge backlog full of features.

249
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:08,225
And when you try to talk to them about
the other types of work and the other

250
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:13,365
things that it takes to have a healthy
product, they just brush it off, and

251
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:14,945
they want to talk more about features.

252
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:20,385
If it isn't obvious, This
is not where you find flow.

253
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:22,325
This is not how you find flow.

254
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:28,235
So you have a company that's obsessed
with new features, but when you

255
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:36,034
really look at the work, 90 percent
of the work they're doing, And

256
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:42,135
the more you build features,
the 90 percent goes up to 95%.

257
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:44,535
It actually keeps getting
worse and worse and worse.

258
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:50,805
The question arises, what are the
hidden costs of adding more features?

259
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:56,605
So to illustrate this, I want
to do a quick demonstration of

260
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,455
something we call the debt spiral.

261
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:03,085
So there's companies like this, as
we know, that push out feature work.

262
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,710
As their primary mode of operation
over and over year after year.

263
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,610
As you do that, debt and risk and
toil pile up in your software.

264
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,000
It's just a fact.

265
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,910
You write code intending it
to do something and something

266
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,470
else happens in the background.

267
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,360
Toil as well as quality going down
because defects are piling up.

268
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,760
We've known this for over 50 years
and we still haven't solved it.

269
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,800
You can do this for a while and
you can keep your head above water,

270
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,380
but eventually get to the point.

271
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,810
Where there's so much defect work and
there's so much debt and risk built

272
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,650
up into your system that it's very
hard to build any new features and

273
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,720
your feature work slows to a crawl.

274
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,730
This actually happened to Nokia and
they actually went out of business.

275
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,290
This is actually what killed Nokia.

276
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,970
How do you get out of this?

277
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,560
How do you actually get out of
this debt spiral and pull out?

278
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,670
What you have to do is you have to put
your feature work on hold for a while.

279
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,950
And this is a difficult move to make.

280
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,470
Because most people that, that feed the
feature work into the system at top down

281
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:18,790
companies, they get incented and promoted
based on pushing out feature work.

282
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,150
So when you're asking them to pause
feature work, there's a personal

283
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,800
reason why they don't want to do it.

284
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,750
But those companies that are
forward leaning and strategic,

285
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,660
they do find ways to do this,
including our company at PlanView.

286
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,270
When you do this and focus on
debt work for a period of time,

287
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,430
You can make a big difference.

288
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,950
And when I say a period, I don't
mean like a week or a month.

289
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,660
Sometimes this could be six
months or a year of focus.

290
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,060
I have one client that it
seemed to focus on debt work and

291
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,960
modernization for two or three years.

292
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,350
And it was their strategic area
of focus for two or three years.

293
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,750
That was their strategy.

294
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,180
The idea is if you do that for the
long enough time, you can actually

295
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,780
get to the point where your defects
go down almost to zero and your debt,

296
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,400
your risk and your toil go down.

297
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,020
And Which, of course, gets you the
results you were after in the beginning,

298
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,060
which is your quality goes up and your
feature work goes up and everyone's happy.

299
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,470
This sounds too simple.

300
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,940
Many people haven't done it.

301
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,520
Those that have are
doing quite well with it.

302
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:30,560
A lot of other people tend to look for
flow in developer productivity dashboards.

303
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,880
The word productivity has been all over
the market for the last several years.

304
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,600
And I hate to say it, but I don't think
this is where you find flow either.

305
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,350
As I said before, 90 percent of
software costs are maintenance.

306
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,890
So if 90 percent of software costs are
maintenance, and 70 percent of your

307
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,770
coding effort is understanding the
code, most of the time we're spending

308
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,270
is just trying to understand what to do.

309
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,260
So if we really want to make a
difference, if we really want to make

310
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,890
people productive, wouldn't we just
make the code easier to understand,

311
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,870
which could be a tech debt initiative?

312
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,310
Makes sense to me.

313
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,050
Another thing about productivity,
and this is going back to the very

314
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,220
beginning, humans feel the most
energized when they feel some sense

315
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,150
of agency over the work they're doing.

316
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,300
They'll run through a wall for you if
they have a say in the work they do.

317
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,330
If 90 percent of the work at your company
is dictated by the management, how much

318
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,084
do those people feel they have a say?

319
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:33,355
So if you really want a
productive workforce, give them

320
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:34,595
a say over the work they do.

321
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,325
Stop telling them what to do.

322
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,135
Give them some say.

323
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:40,715
Let them come up with the way they're
going to solve these problems.

324
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:42,225
And what problems are they going to solve?

325
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:46,925
If you're really after productivity
and you refuse to give them a say as we

326
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,635
all know, 70 percent of what we build
our users probably won't even use.

327
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:55,375
So my prediction is 70 percent of your
software won't be used by your users.

328
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,790
But of course, that's not the kind of
predictability you're probably after.

329
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,770
Another place I see people looking
for flow is in scrum dashboards.

330
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,550
30 years later, we're still
trying to get scrum perfected.

331
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,260
Still not a good place to look for flow.

332
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,410
I find a lot of companies that are
really trying to adopt rigid scrum,

333
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,070
and they pride themselves on delivering
stories to an artificial cadence.

334
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,940
But when I ask their customer how
long does it take you to get value,

335
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,220
I find a lot of dissatisfaction.

336
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,470
One of the customers actually
said our delivery of value looks

337
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,100
the same as it did 20 years ago.

338
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:36,825
And from my experience, that's
really not that far off.

339
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:41,665
I wouldn't go through all these
different, detours if I didn't

340
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:42,665
think there was a better way.

341
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:45,015
And I'm happy to say that I
think there is a better way.

342
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:48,735
But it's quite a bit different where most
people think they need to look for flow.

343
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:53,305
I actually think flow and the way
companies should be organized looks

344
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:57,625
more like this picture than the original
picture with the two separate circles.

345
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:02,645
Demand generation and
demand fulfillment Demand.

346
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:04,275
Can't be separated.

347
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:08,745
Strategy and execution,
they need to work together.

348
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:10,585
There is an overlap between the two.

349
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:15,555
And the more that you figure that overlap
out, the better off you're going to be.

350
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:18,765
If you don't figure it out,
flow eventually gets lost in

351
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:20,695
the seams between the people.

352
00:20:23,195 --> 00:20:25,445
While this is a simple way of
looking at it, it's far more

353
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:27,265
complex than this, obviously.

354
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,820
So if you look at a typical software
development process that takes ideas

355
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,970
and takes them to impact with customers,
you'll see that there's a lot of

356
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:42,210
different people and stakeholders and
groups involved from sales, marketing,

357
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:49,160
business owners, product managers, product
owners, designers, front end engineers,

358
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,630
backend engineers, different teams.

359
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,500
We even have engagement managers
managing the developers and product

360
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,180
owners giving the developers work.

361
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,660
So this is.

362
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,300
These are a lot of different
people involved in this.

363
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,810
We have release engineers.

364
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,120
We have support engineers.

365
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,500
Everywhere you see a bubble on
this chart, you have a seam.

366
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,230
There are seams everywhere.

367
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,310
And if you don't manage the seams,
that's where flow goes to die.

368
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:21,630
So the real reasons The reason why
flow is impacted, the reasons that

369
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,550
actually cost us the most money are
the things that happen on the seams.

370
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,080
These are things we can't
figure out by ourselves.

371
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,800
The first one is we haven't
figured out how to schedule our

372
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,780
work in a way that delivers value
the fastest to the customers.

373
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,430
Engineering can't schedule
work on their own.

374
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,500
Product can't schedule work on their own.

375
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,120
This is something we have to do together.

376
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,720
And we don't do things together very well.

377
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,530
We have poor handoffs from
product to engineering.

378
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,560
We make bad choices, both
on the technology side, as

379
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,690
well as the product side.

380
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,130
We have unplanned work that comes up.

381
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,470
That unplanned work comes from both sides.

382
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,250
And we're not very good
at figuring that out.

383
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,600
And we have quality issues.

384
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,520
Quality is everyone's problem.

385
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,610
It's not just engineering's problem.

386
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,480
So we need to figure out how to, how do
we work together to solve these things.

387
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,170
A long time ago, 2001, a paper was
written called Nobody Ever Gets Credit

388
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,160
for Fixing Problems That Never Happened.

389
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:20,290
In the paper, the authors
described two loops.

390
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,890
The first one on the left is called the
Working Harder Loop, and the one on the

391
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,780
right is called the Working Smarter Loop.

392
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,260
Every company has a gap
with their competitors.

393
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,520
Every company wants to close that gap.

394
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,040
The problem is, gaps never stay
closed, because everything that comes

395
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,830
together eventually falls apart.

396
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,460
This is the second law of thermodynamics.

397
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,830
It's just the way the world is.

398
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,220
So you're constantly trying to
close gaps with your competitors.

399
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,440
The working harder loop closes
the gap by working harder.

400
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,520
Trying to get people to work
weekends, and work extra hours

401
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,440
and do the right thing, you know.

402
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,970
That can work, and it does work.

403
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,750
The problem is, it doesn't work for long.

404
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,860
The second side is the
working smarter loop.

405
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,720
So instead of trying to close your
gaps with your competitors by working

406
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,565
harder, You're trying to close it
by investing in new capabilities, by

407
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:14,905
improving your processes, by doing
debt work, and improving your software.

408
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:21,235
The problem is, when you work smarter,
there is a longer time to feedback.

409
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:23,195
Much longer time to feedback.

410
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:24,975
You can see the loop
is a little bit longer.

411
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:26,395
And you have to be patient.

412
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,605
If you're not patient, and you
can't wait for that feedback, you

413
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:33,295
short circuit the loop and you go
back to the working harder loop.

414
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,600
There's a lot to this paper.

415
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:41,670
It's available on the internet, but I
think they knew in 2001 why continuous

416
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,740
improvement isn't sticking in companies.

417
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,410
It's pretty much outlined here.

418
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,980
It's mainly because humans
don't do well when feedback

419
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,650
is distant in time and space.

420
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,500
We need to find ways to encourage
people to be more patient.

421
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,230
Now, it's easy to say it's hard to do.

422
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,500
I understand.

423
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,230
I used to be a musician.

424
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,080
I played in a band for a number of
years that was going to be my career.

425
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,610
And then I got a real job working
in it and the rest was history.

426
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,010
Miles Davis, Chopin, others
spoke about this concept of

427
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,600
the space between the notes.

428
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,340
So everyone wants to divide things up.

429
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:19,865
You do your part, I do my part.

430
00:24:19,865 --> 00:24:22,145
The racy says I do this, you do this.

431
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:26,875
The problem with that is that there's real
things of value that happen between us,

432
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,055
or at least that could happen between us.

433
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:31,295
Musicians know this.

434
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:36,985
If you look at a jazz band, you take a
jazz band in first grade and you watch

435
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:38,615
how they're playing their instruments.

436
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:41,625
Each person is focused so
much on their instrument.

437
00:24:41,925 --> 00:24:43,145
They want to do their part.

438
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:44,715
That's the only thing they're focused on.

439
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:48,245
They're not listening to how can
I interact with the person next

440
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:49,755
to me and make something better.

441
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:54,835
If you go to a club and you find a really
good jazz band, let's say in Detroit where

442
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:57,945
I'm from, they're doing the opposite.

443
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,275
Those guys are more listening
to each other and interacting

444
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,825
with each other, and they're not
trying to stay in their own lane.

445
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:06,315
They're trying to create something
that's never existed before.

446
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,395
That sounds a lot like software to me.

447
00:25:08,995 --> 00:25:11,625
That sounds a lot like what
we're really trying to do.

448
00:25:12,235 --> 00:25:13,085
The surprises.

449
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:16,175
Remember from the beginning of the
talk, that's where the real value is.

450
00:25:16,985 --> 00:25:21,945
So my advice is resist the urge to
break everything down into pieces

451
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:24,085
and lose your focus on the whole.

452
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:28,435
It's okay to break things down,
but you still got to find a way to

453
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:32,265
keep the focus on the whole because
that's where the real value is.

454
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:34,515
That's where the real surprises are.

455
00:25:34,905 --> 00:25:35,975
Focus on the customer.

456
00:25:36,775 --> 00:25:39,575
I've got a few tips to leave
you with here at the end.

457
00:25:39,645 --> 00:25:41,095
I just have a rolling list of tips.

458
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:42,935
These are some things that
I'll provide you with.

459
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:46,755
I think value measurement and
measurement of work is really important.

460
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:51,725
And if you look at the way we measure
value, it's changed a lot over the years.

461
00:25:52,145 --> 00:25:56,625
So back in the waterfall days, we had
these big bulky projects and we had

462
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:59,725
these statements of work and we knew
what we were delivering to customers.

463
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,045
We were pretty clear eyed on that.

464
00:26:01,085 --> 00:26:04,195
Everyone on the project knew what it
was cause it was big and it was bulky.

465
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:08,155
And then we swung the pendulum way
over to the left and we started

466
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:12,085
measuring stories with Dora and
other measurement approaches.

467
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:16,610
And people lost sight of what it is
we're trying to bring to the customer.

468
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,110
We're so focused on our
cadences and our iterations.

469
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,300
I think the pendulum needs to swing
back a little bit to the middle.

470
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:27,360
Like a happy medium, where we have
features that we deliver to customers.

471
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,380
We know why we're delivering
them to customers.

472
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,800
And that's really where our
focus of measurement is.

473
00:26:32,345 --> 00:26:37,615
This idiom can be thought of in a lot of
different ways, measure twice, cut once.

474
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:41,525
Most of the time we spend doing
software development is thinking

475
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:44,945
about what to do, and a small
amount of time is actually doing it.

476
00:26:45,465 --> 00:26:47,745
The same is true of design of software.

477
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,215
Make sure you put your best
people on the thinking.

478
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:53,955
Don't have someone else doing the thinking
and someone else doing the development.

479
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:55,886
Put your best engineers on the thinking.

480
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:59,054
That's where you're going to get
the most benefit out of design work.

481
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:00,028
Identify and track dependencies.

482
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:01,490
We've never been good at this.

00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:08,685
It's going to be required
for us to improve our flow.

489
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:11,735
Focus less on prioritization,
more on sequencing.

490
00:27:12,035 --> 00:27:15,265
If you've started something, try to
finish it before you start something new.

491
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:17,925
We call this fastest value first.

492
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,635
Pay attention to unplanned work.

493
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:21,135
Find ways to signal it.

494
00:27:21,585 --> 00:27:24,045
Once you have signaled it,
find ways to remove it.

495
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:27,855
This is one of the biggest drains on
flow that we see with our clients.

496
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,305
Understand your variability.

497
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:36,090
Average numbers, like average flow time,
Averages of any sort can be misleading.

498
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,210
Look behind the variability to see
the lanes in your traffic and try to

499
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,740
understand what's really happening.

500
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,140
And last but not least,
you make choices every day.

501
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,810
Are you going to work your people harder?

502
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,990
Are you going to point
your finger at them?

503
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,050
Or are you going to work smarter?

504
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,220
If you're going to work smarter, you need
to encourage people to be patient and

505
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,565
wait, because the benefits of investment
in the right thing are worth the time.

506
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:04,605
Thank you very much for
listening to me today.

507
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:06,235
Have a great conference.
