00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,420
Hello everyone and welcome to Conf42
Incident Management 2024 conference.

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,299
Imagine your organization
facing a major security issue.

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,040
Time is running out, things are
chaotic, and everyone is scrambling

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,250
to fix the problem to fix the problem.

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,640
And to make the situation more
interesting, communications

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,550
are falling apart.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,900
Does it sound familiar?

8
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:34,255
As a cybersecurity analyst, we
spend a whole lot of our time

9
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:38,555
building security controls that
we hope will prevent an incident

10
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:40,025
from happening in the first place.

11
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:46,815
But the reality is that the
incident happens or will happen.

12
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:53,145
What if you have had a clear
step by step guide to tackle any

13
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:55,395
incident quickly and efficiently?

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:03,950
Which is why a cyber security team or an
organization is expected to have a strong

15
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:11,919
understanding of what to do or how to
do or what to do when things go wrong.

16
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:18,300
In today's talk, I'll be exploring
what an incident response playbook

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,470
is and how we can implement one.

18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:21,614
for listening.

19
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:24,499
My name is Chinye Chinekizi.

20
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:27,714
I'm an SUL security analyst
with Saifal Technologies.

21
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:32,905
And on today's talk, I'll be
looking at master incident response,

22
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:36,084
elevate efficiency with playbook.

23
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:38,024
Let's dive into it.

24
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:43,984
So in order to, drive this talk,
I'll be looking at some outline.

25
00:01:45,254 --> 00:01:48,004
One of them is understanding
what incident response is.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,249
We also be considering the challenges
that in incident management.

27
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:58,789
What is incident response playbook is,
we also be considering the benefits

28
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,710
of using incident response playbook.

29
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,149
Then the guide to creating one.

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,610
We also consider looking at the elements
of an effective incident playbook.

31
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,180
And then we look at an example, the tools
and technology, and then we conclude.

32
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:19,350
Understanding incident response.

33
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,700
According to NIST, NIST actually defined
incident response as a systematic process

34
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,260
for handling cyber security incidents.

35
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,909
Incidents like data breaches or
malware infection or any form

36
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:36,599
of cyber security incidents.

37
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:41,310
Why do we actually need incident response?

38
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,099
One of the reasons why we need it.

39
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:50,774
It's because it actually helps
to reduce damage and downtime.

40
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:57,935
It also ensures business continuity
and protects sensitive data from

41
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:02,875
being exploited by the tracked
actors when there is an incident.

42
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:11,214
And in order to do this, or to be
able to effectively protect our data

43
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:16,635
from being exploited, NIST actually
provided us with four guides.

44
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:20,474
These four guides are preparations.

45
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,745
We have the detection and analysis.

46
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:26,875
We have the curtailment and
eradication and recovery.

47
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:29,484
We also have the post incident activities.

48
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:37,284
We also have the sound incident response,
which actually also states or outline

49
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:41,234
the steps that could be taken in order
to detect and prepare for an incident.

50
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,570
Now we're looking at the
challenges in incident management.

51
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:51,309
One of the challenges in incident
management is lack of clear procedures.

52
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:57,539
Without a clear process, there is a
risk of confusion and delay in response,

53
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,609
especially when something goes wrong.

54
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,219
And also, there is bound to be an error
in the incident management process,

55
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,810
because at that point, The team
might end up working on an assumption

56
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,899
without a clear path to follow.

57
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,839
We also have inadequate incident
categorization and prioritization.

58
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,610
This is a major issue.

59
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,409
Where incidents are not properly
categorized, it can lead to

60
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,330
the team giving top priority to
the least expected, incidents.

61
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:31,480
Thanks.

62
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,510
Lack of tools and resources, where there
is no tools and resources, it becomes

63
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,190
a challenge to effectively manage
or, quickly respond to the incident.

64
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,210
We have the inadequate training, where
there is no training, it makes it

65
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,675
difficult for the team to effectively,
jump at the incident when it happens.

66
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:55,850
We have lack of communication
and collaborations.

67
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,100
And now we're looking at what
incident response playbook is.

68
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,960
An incident response playbook
is a detailed, structured set of

69
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,350
procedures that actually outlines
what an organization should do

70
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,630
in an event an incident happens.

71
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,380
It tells them how to detect it, how
to respond to it, and how to recover

72
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,890
from the cybersecurity incident.

73
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,030
One primary goal of incident response
is to help organization minimize

74
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,819
the impact of breaches and to
ensure they restore back to normal.

75
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,440
Or they return back to business
as quickly as possible.

76
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,620
So there are different types of
playbooks that an organization

77
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,490
can actually decide to develop.

78
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,476
And this is based on the potential
threat identified in the environment.

79
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,970
As well as the kind of
operation they are into.

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,460
And as well as their sizes.

81
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,740
So there are different playbooks
that they could choose from.

82
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,420
This is a list of some playbooks.

83
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,959
There are more playbooks that
could be exploited, but this

84
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,560
one listed here are just few.

85
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,910
One is the Ransom playbook.

86
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,860
We also have the DataBridge.

87
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,249
We have the Marwell playbook.

88
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,355
We have up to the Zero
Day Variability playbook.

89
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:19,210
This list are just few.

90
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,610
There are many other playbooks
that could be developed by an

91
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,450
organization based on their identified
traits within their business

92
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,600
operations as well as their sizes.

93
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:34,725
Then we look at the benefits
of incident response playbook.

94
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:39,345
One of the benefits of incident
playbook is improved efficiencies.

95
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:44,665
Because there's already streamlined
process, it helps the team to

96
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:49,765
quickly respond to the incident
and then reduce the downtime or

97
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:52,285
the impact of those incidents.

98
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:54,765
You have the enhanced effectiveness.

99
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,470
Because of the clear procedures that
are already outlined what they to do

100
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,740
and how they are to go about it, it
helps the decision making very fast.

101
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:13,489
And then they end up making an impactful
action or taking a more impactful action.

102
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,640
It also increase collaboration
where there is a well defined role.

103
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,620
It helps them to be able to know who
to escalate to because they already

104
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:30,020
have The role metrics that spells
out what school they are to escalate

105
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,100
to in an event something goes wrong.

106
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,930
So it shows the chain of
escalation, making the coordination

107
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,320
of the incident very smooth.

108
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,370
And then we have guides to
creating incidents playbook.

109
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:49,450
One important thing to note is that
before an organization can go ahead

110
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,320
in, Developing an instant playbook,
there's need for them to actually

111
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,540
understand their security posture.

112
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:04,690
And this is actually done by, identifying
the potential variability and threats

113
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,400
that are specific to the operations.

114
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,280
And by so doing, they are able
to come up with the strategy to

115
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,600
curtail those identified weaknesses.

116
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,310
And this is done by performing
penetration testing.

117
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,315
Or, We're really assessment.

118
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:26,365
These two testing actually gives them
an overview of how that environment is

119
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:33,064
as well as the witnesses and possible
remediation of what they can do to

120
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:39,374
ensuring a stronger security posture
and you have creates reporting.

121
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:40,124
Checklist.

122
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:48,854
would like to also mention before I go
to create a reporting checklist that This

123
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:58,474
test actually helps them to determine the
severity as well as also be able to define

124
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:03,644
the priorities because identifying those
vulnerabilities within the environment

125
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:08,814
will help them to be able to have a proper
categorization as well as prioritizing

126
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:13,134
those incidents based on their severity
and impact on their businesses.

127
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:16,824
I move on to the CREATE
REPORTING CHECKLIST.

128
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:22,714
So this checklist is like a template
that helps the team to be able to

129
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:27,204
document their findings during the
investigation and be able to enter

130
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:31,544
the activities that are executed in
order to, curtail those incidents.

131
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,244
They will have defined a clear procedures.

132
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:37,484
Like we rightly mentioned, there
are different types of playbooks.

133
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:43,604
And these playbooks should have a clear
process for detecting, investigating

134
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:47,794
and also identifying the potential
security and then prioritizing them

135
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,654
based on their severity and impact.

136
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:53,984
This can only be achieved where
the organization already have a

137
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:58,054
clear understanding of what poses
a threat in their environment.

138
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,163
They have established
roles and responsibilities.

139
00:10:01,163 --> 00:10:07,920
This is very key because it
helps in the escalation point.

140
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,780
Also have developed communication plans.

141
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,660
Then you have tests.

142
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,780
After developing those processes,
there is a need to actually test

143
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,340
to know the effectiveness of those
processes, of those tools that have

144
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:28,540
been implemented, to detect and actually
help this, the organization's security.

145
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,950
This can be done by performing
a tabletop exercise.

146
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:36,515
This tabletop exercise helps to
determine the readiness of the

147
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:38,945
team in fighting against incidents.

148
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:42,155
And then we have the reform, the refined.

149
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:48,135
The refined actually helps in
identifying the gaps and possible

150
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:49,885
improvements of the processes.

151
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:55,975
When an exercise is done, the tabletop
exercise is done, then you're able to

152
00:10:55,975 --> 00:11:01,145
identify what is not properly taken
care of and you're able to improve on it

153
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:02,985
by refining those processes as needed.

154
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:08,315
And taking into account the new
identifying gaps is and how they could

155
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:11,295
build a stronger security posture.

156
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:15,495
And then we have the next
four phase explained.

157
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:21,745
These four steps actually gives
a better understanding to the

158
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:27,135
organization or the security team on
how they could know be incident ready.

159
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:33,205
Firstly, I would like to highlight that
for any organization to be able to have

160
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:38,215
And if effective playbook there is need
for them to have a better understanding

161
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:43,945
of what needs guideline incident guideline
is, which has a clear understanding

162
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:48,975
of what needs guideline is, it's very
difficult for them to be able to, take

163
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:55,365
into account these four phases and be able
to get ready for any form of incident.

164
00:11:55,805 --> 00:12:01,065
So in order to have this incident
properly outlined, and, in

165
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:02,485
line with the best practices.

166
00:12:03,335 --> 00:12:07,665
It is important the organization
understand this framework and

167
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:11,455
by so doing, they are able to
build it into this process and

168
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:13,965
then have an effective playbook.

169
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:18,875
Now we'll be looking at the key elements
of an effective incident playbook.

170
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:22,145
So the key elements are four.

171
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:24,515
One is the initiating condition.

172
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:28,290
This particular one defines
What the trigger is,

173
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,600
then you have the process steps.

174
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,230
This actually spelled out the
step by step instruction on

175
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,670
how to execute the playbook.

176
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,530
Like I said, there are different
types of playbook and each

177
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,740
playbooks has its unique processes.

178
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,780
The way phishing playbook is actually
different from how the malware

179
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,770
playbook is, because the flow of
the two are actually different.

180
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,050
And so the steps to
curtailing them also differs.

181
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,160
So the playbook actually spelled
out how this can be executed.

182
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,610
Then you have the roles
and responsibilities.

183
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,900
This actually tells you which of the
team is responsible for what, which

184
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,520
must be in line with the best practices.

185
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,610
And then we have the communication.

186
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,520
Here describes the internal and
external communication procedures.

187
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,470
With the communication metrics,
you are able to identify the

188
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,120
escalation points for the escalation.

189
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:34,675
Line or chain, which helps to the team
to be able to coordinate properly.

190
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:43,225
Now we're looking at a typical example
of efficient attack response playbook.

191
00:13:43,895 --> 00:13:46,765
This is not the best of it, but this
is just for the purpose of learning.

192
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:50,505
So I'll be assuming it.

193
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:57,725
A large organization, a financial
organization, faced a suffocated

194
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:00,955
phishing attack targeting its employees.

195
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:05,755
The attacker aimed to steal sensitive
information and gain unauthorized

196
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:07,585
access to the complaint system.

197
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:12,555
Remember the first thing we said, trigger,
which is the initiating condition.

198
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:18,055
The employer, the employee
reports a suspicious email or the

199
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:21,995
security team detected the unusual
logging attempt and flagged them

200
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:23,355
as potential phishing attempts.

201
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,330
So this is a trigger.

202
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,610
The employee reports it
as a suspicious email.

203
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,970
Or, the security team are able to detect
it using any of the automated tools.

204
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:45,140
Now, we'll go to how this can be built
into the NIST Incident Response Plan.

205
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,350
One, we have the detection state.

206
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,145
Or, Remember we said
it's a phishing email.

207
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:57,155
So the first thing is to verify
that it's a phishing attempt because

208
00:14:57,175 --> 00:15:00,945
the trigger said it's a phishing
attempt to steal information.

209
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:05,085
in verifying the phishing
attempt, we're going to be

210
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,055
considering looking at the IOCs.

211
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:10,985
We're talking about the malicious
link, the attachments, and the

212
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:15,375
impersonated domains using some
threat intelligent platforms.

213
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:24,845
let's such as Recorded Future or
SODAN or Abuse IDP, IDPX, sorry.

214
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:30,995
So in such situation, the team
goes in there to check and see

215
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:35,175
if there have been any reported
abuse on the identified hiruses.

216
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:37,455
And then we move to containment.

217
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:39,725
Containment has to do with
stopping this freight.

218
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:46,095
And stopping this thread is stated that
you block the sender's email address.

219
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:48,595
You quarantine the affected email.

220
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:53,155
You also revoke any access that is
granted by the compromise credentials.

221
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:55,625
So I'll move to the eradication.

222
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:59,665
So you have scanned the affected endpoint.

223
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:04,915
You also review the logs to ensure
that there is no other employee who

224
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:08,975
must have clicked on the, compromised
or interacted with the emails.

225
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,380
If there is any, you reset
their passwords just to ensure

226
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,280
that there is no more spread.

227
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,370
Then we go to the recovery.

228
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,670
Here you are ensuring that
all the compromised accounts

229
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,240
on the system are secured.

230
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,320
You can test by also stimulating
the potential phishing exploits to

231
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,240
be sure that there is no residue
remaining within the environment.

232
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,040
Then you post incident activity.

233
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,020
There you are reviewing
the attack details.

234
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:44,320
The response efforts and the results,
you're looking at what you've done and

235
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,520
you're trying to identify the gaps as well
as what you can do better to improve on

236
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:55,810
the pull on the security posture and here
you can determine or begin to consider

237
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,180
looking at strengthening the email filters
and possible also providing possible

238
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:06,040
trainings to the employee to ensure
that they are actually phishing aware,

239
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,750
especially when they see any of those
emails being sent by the threat actors.

240
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:19,000
So this is a sample of possible phishing
response playbook that could be developed

241
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,990
to, prevent a spread of phishing attack.

242
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,470
This is not the best of it, but
just to give us an idea of how

243
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,310
efficient response playbook look like.

244
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,310
And then we look at the tools.

245
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,780
These tools are actually used
to automate the playbooks.

246
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:45,000
One of them is the security information
and events management, which is the same.

247
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,540
And under this team, there are
different, SIM tools that could be used.

248
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,350
One of them is Plum, and
you have the list of orders.

249
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,530
You also have the endpoints
detection and response, tools.

250
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,510
An example, you have the Carbon Black,
you have the Microsoft Defender,

251
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,830
and we have the SOAR, which is
also the Security Orchestration,

252
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,530
Automation, and Response tools.

253
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,510
One of the examples is Microsoft Sentinel.

254
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,930
So there are different tools that
could be used in that regards.

255
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,530
We also have the Incident
Management tools.

256
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,130
So we have different tools within
that square that could be used.

257
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,450
We also have the Threat
Intelligence Platform.

258
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,480
One of them is Recorded Future,
and you have all the rest of

259
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,710
others that could be used.

260
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,650
In using this tool, we cannot rule
out the woman factor or the woman

261
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,910
intelligence, because the woman
intelligence helps to analyze some of

262
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:49,660
the, identified, threat indicators, and
they are able to, speak to those issues.

263
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:55,855
Actually, when In especially when
in identifying the incidents, in,

264
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,690
in identifying those incidents,
you either be true or false.

265
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,990
Sometimes you have some incidents
that are false positive.

266
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,320
So with the women intelligence,
you're able to identify and look

267
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,650
at the behavior as well as their
normalities and be able to determine

268
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,690
if they're true or they're false.

269
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,200
This is also the role of
woman intelligence in deter

270
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,935
in playbooks and also in.

271
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:20,535
Ensuring the security of incidents.

272
00:19:23,585 --> 00:19:25,535
then we have common pitfalls to avoid.

273
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:26,975
One is outdated playbook.

274
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:34,215
Due to the evolving nature of
technology, the cyber actors or the

275
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:39,595
threat actors also keep improving
their tactics on how to get into our

276
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,755
system and steal valuable information.

277
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:47,925
So organizations need to ensure that
their playbooks are updated and updated.

278
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:54,455
And they are also up to the
current security, trend.

279
00:19:55,325 --> 00:20:01,095
They have lack of testing where processes
or tools are not tested to validate

280
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:04,405
their effectiveness in detecting
those abnormalities, those incidents.

281
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:08,485
It can be an issue and
that should be avoided.

282
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:12,925
And then we have poor communication
where there is no proper definition

283
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:14,155
of communication metrics.

284
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:20,080
It becomes a challenge because You
wouldn't know who to escalate to.

285
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,540
So the chain of communication becomes a
challenge, so that need to be avoided.

286
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:32,020
And then in conclusion, I will say
that by using a well designed incident

287
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:38,170
response playbook, organizations are
able to enhance efficiency and reduce

288
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,690
downtime, and also improve on their role.

289
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:44,385
overall security posture.

290
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:46,235
Thank you for listening.
