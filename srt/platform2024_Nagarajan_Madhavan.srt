00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,860
I work for Intuit as a senior staff
engineer, and I work on delivering AI

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,250
driven interactions in my long career.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,380
I've looked far.

8
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:37,380
In front teams and contributed to
developer platforms, shipping tools,

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,320
SDKs, and established self-serving kiosks.

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,720
I always wondered if there is
some intelligent assistant who can

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,490
help me become more productive and
efficient, wide, repetitive tasks.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,840
in this sta in this talk, I'm
excited to talk about an intelligent

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,004
assistant in the form of AI chat
bots in platform engineering.

14
00:00:58,245 --> 00:00:59,994
AI powered

15
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,694
chatbots are intelligent
systems that can interact with

16
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:06,674
users using natural language.

17
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:12,624
They have the potential to significantly
impact platform engineering, a critical

18
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:16,434
area in modern software development
that deals with infrastructure,

19
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:18,694
automation, and DevOps practices.

20
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:23,134
Today, we will dive into how
these chatbots can revolutionize

21
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:26,754
platform engineering by automating
tasks, enhancing collaboration,

22
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,634
and improving overall efficiency.

23
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:36,214
AI powered chatbots are tools that use
natural language, machine learning, and,

24
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:41,504
generative AI to understand and respond to
user commands in a conversational manner.

25
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:47,474
These chatbots integrate with various
backend systems, which again is enhanced

26
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:52,674
by the machine learning or generative
AI to perform complex tasks, making them

27
00:01:52,674 --> 00:01:54,464
powerful tools for platform engineering.

28
00:01:55,774 --> 00:01:57,864
An example is like chatbots.

29
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:03,134
We already have chatbots, for, from
Slack and from Microsoft Teams, which

30
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:07,054
are, already being used for DevOps
environments to streamline workflows

31
00:02:07,414 --> 00:02:08,854
and facilitate communications.

32
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:11,494
And chatbots can be proactive.

33
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:14,924
It can start the conversation
based on a triggering event

34
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:17,434
and is available 24 seven.

35
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:19,504
what is the gaps?

36
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:20,944
What are the gaps?

37
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:25,804
the platform engineering, what are the
gaps, that the chatbot can address?

38
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,044
first, they simplify complexity.

39
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:34,424
Managing complex infrastructural systems
can be overwhelming, but chatbots provide

40
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:37,894
an intuitive natural language interface
that makes this task more accessible.

41
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,594
Second, they automate repetitive tasks.

42
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:45,164
Chatbots can handle routine operations
like deployments, monitoring, and

43
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:50,834
scaling, significantly reducing the
manual workload for the engineers.

44
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:55,054
And third, they enhance
real time collaboration by

45
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:59,166
integrating with communication
platforms like Slack or Teams.

46
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:04,574
AI chatbots enable teams to have actual
real time conversations, which speeds up

47
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,444
decision making and problem resolution.

48
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,814
Last, they empower users.

49
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:15,874
Chatterbots allow developers and
engineers to perform tasks independently

50
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:21,204
without needing specialized knowledge
or waiting for central teams to step in.

51
00:03:21,914 --> 00:03:26,814
This self service capability speeds up
workflows and enhances productivity.

52
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:30,354
Transformative benefits of AI Chatterbots.

53
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:32,044
Efficiency.

54
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:37,779
By automating repetitive tasks,
chatbots significantly speed up

55
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:41,939
operations, leading to quicker
deployments, faster issue resolution,

56
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,209
and overall improved productivity.

57
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,049
Scalability.

58
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:52,349
AI chatbots can handle increasing
workloads without performance bottlenecks,

59
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:58,979
allowing platforms operations to
scale efficiently as demand grows.

60
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,339
Proactive operations.

61
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:05,499
Chatbots can monitor systems in real time.

62
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:10,459
automatically triggering responses to
potential issues before they escalate,

63
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,849
which helps in maintaining the
health and stability of the platform.

64
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,129
Consistency.

65
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,649
Chatbots can ensure standardized
execution of tasks, reducing

66
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:23,889
variability and the risk of human error.

67
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:27,049
This consistency is crucial
in maintaining reliable and

68
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,579
predictable platform performance.

69
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:32,129
User empowered helps.

70
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:38,069
One of the most impactful benefits
is how chat bots empower engineers

71
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:41,699
by providing them with the tools
to manage tasks independently.

72
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:47,369
This helps help reduces the bot link
speeds up development cycles, and

73
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:51,544
free out the security team to focus on
more strategic initiatives rather than

74
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:57,974
repeating, the same, work with different
teams they support and, getting exhausted.

75
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:04,104
Some of the, practical use cases,
infrastructure provisioning, chatbots can

76
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,194
automate the setup of new environments.

77
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:12,764
For example, a developer can, instruct
the chatbot to create a testing

78
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:16,844
environment for two EC2 instances.

79
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:21,774
And the chatbot will
handle the entire process.

80
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:25,394
the CNCD pipeline management chatbots.

81
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,549
Can allow the developers to trigger
paints, deployments, and even rollback,

82
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:36,729
rollbacks via simple chat commands,
making continuous integration and delivery

83
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:39,389
processes more accessible and efficient.

84
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:41,549
Monitoring alerts.

85
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,179
Chatbots can integrate with monitoring
tools to send real time alerts

86
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,314
about system performance issues
directly within the chat interface.

87
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:56,984
Developers can respond immediately,
running diagnostic commands or triggering

88
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,034
recovery procedures right from the chat.

89
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:01,774
Incident management.

90
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:05,934
During outages or incidents,
chatbots streamline response

91
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:07,694
efforts by automating workflows.

92
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:12,264
They can escalate issues, provide
real time updates, and coordinate the

93
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:14,704
actions needed to resolve quickly.

94
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,084
Finally, knowledge access.

95
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,379
AI chatbots can instantly retrieve
documentation, facts, or troubleshooting

96
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,689
steps, providing teams with the
information they need to resolve issues

97
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:32,779
quickly without having to search through
the extensive manuals or databases,

98
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:36,109
leveraging the power of GDT AI.

99
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:40,909
An overview of the typical
chatbot architecture.

100
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:45,449
It has a user interaction layer.

101
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:49,469
Chatbot interacts with the
users via platforms like Slack,

102
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,349
Teams, or other chat interfaces.

103
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:52,959
It can also be in the build phase.

104
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:57,249
Layers include a natural
language processing engine that

105
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:59,039
interprets the user commands.

106
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,479
The core logic layer is essential.

107
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:04,869
The, essentially, the
brain of the chatbot.

108
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:07,919
Here, the dialogue manage,
dialogue management.

109
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:12,349
task orchestration takes place,
determining the appropriate

110
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,039
action space around users input.

111
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:18,729
The integration layer connects the
chatbot to various tools and platforms

112
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:23,589
such as, Jenkins, Kubernetes,
or cloud management systems.

113
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:29,659
this allows the chatbot to perform complex
tasks like deployment or monitoring

114
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,729
directly through these integrations.

115
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:37,329
Security layer is essential, To ensure
that all interactions are secure with,

116
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:42,419
identity and access management controlling
who can execute specific commands,

117
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,039
ensuring only secure, only authorized
users can perform critical operations.

118
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:51,989
And finally, continuous learning layer
is where the chatbot, AI models are

119
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,769
maintained and improved over time.

120
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:58,189
This layer allows the chatbot to learn
from past interactions, improving its

121
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:00,619
accuracy and functionality with each use.

122
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:04,909
Here is a high level architecture diagram.

123
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:10,959
There is a natural language, the chat,
we see the chat interface, and then a

124
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:13,519
natural language understanding component.

125
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,029
And that component extracts the
entities and then there is a

126
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:21,289
dialogue management component.

127
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:27,549
And the dialogue management component can
be integrated with the backend systems.

128
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,209
And then there is a, the response
is passed to the general message

129
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:36,629
generator and message generator sends
the response to the chat thread.

130
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:41,559
Here's a little more
detailed architecture.

131
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:47,169
You have a layer, we already saw that,
the messaging layer, and then the NLB.

132
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:51,539
The NLB receives internet
recognition and entity recognition.

133
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:56,029
Intent is the intent of the user,
exactly extracting the actual intent.

134
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,329
What is the work that needs to be done?

135
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,319
What is the request coming from the user?

136
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,749
Entity is what is that the work
is going to, or is that, what

137
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:05,829
is that going to get updated?

138
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,889
Thank you.

139
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:08,249
And then we have a Co AI layer.

140
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,959
there's a dialogue management,
which is actually retaining

141
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,429
the previous conversations.

142
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:15,766
And, the context and the memory.

143
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:21,179
And, the knowledge based integration, the
all the exhaustive stuff, documentations,

144
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,599
the, which really I can scan through
and then give a, give a response.

145
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:29,269
And integration with a
large language model.

146
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,859
Okay.

147
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:34,074
And we have the core layer,
the response generation layer.

148
00:09:34,104 --> 00:09:36,444
The response generation
layer can be template based.

149
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:41,014
It can provide dynamic responses,
or it can also provide a multimedia

150
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:44,034
response, like it can generate a
report and share it on the chat thread.

151
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:48,184
Of course, we have a backend
services, which stores the data.

152
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:50,924
Analytics and monitoring
can be built on top of it.

153
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:53,284
And, then there's a security.

154
00:09:53,784 --> 00:09:58,044
And throughout all these layers, we want
to ensure that there is compliance to all

155
00:09:58,054 --> 00:10:02,864
the, to all the regulations, regulatory
bodies, and we ensure the privacy

156
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:06,014
of the end user is also maintained.

157
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:10,174
Challenges this, there are challenges
that we need to be aware of.

158
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:15,684
We need to be aware of while
implementing a chat interaction.

159
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:21,894
the managing the complex commands with
the natural language understanding, it

160
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:28,314
can be a task that needs to be done to
Avoid any, ambiguous misinterpretation

161
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:31,004
of the commands coming from the user.

162
00:10:33,574 --> 00:10:37,824
Security is another major concern
since, chatbots can access uncontrolled

163
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:41,814
sensitive systems, robust security
measures like role based access control

164
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:45,514
and multi factor authentication are
essential to prevent unauthorized access.

165
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:50,224
Integration can be challenging,
especially in complex IT environments,

166
00:10:50,444 --> 00:10:53,074
which a chatbot needs to connect
with various tools and systems.

167
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:56,814
Ensuring compatibility and
a seamless data flow between

168
00:10:56,814 --> 00:10:58,644
these integrations is crucial.

169
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:03,914
User adoption is another key
success factor for the chatbot.

170
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:08,344
If it's not user friendly or
trustworthy, it may be, or

171
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:09,724
it may not be adopted widely.

172
00:11:10,314 --> 00:11:13,604
Intervening its effectiveness,
ensuring the chatbot is intuitive

173
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:16,614
and providing adequate training
are essential steps to encourage.

174
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:17,484
Adoption.

175
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:22,014
Some of the emerging trends in
the, trends in the AI driven

176
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,484
chat bots is multimodality.

177
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,324
So the input may not be
always in the form of text.

178
00:11:27,324 --> 00:11:33,564
It can be a voice based command or it
can be a document, or can be a gesture.

179
00:11:33,564 --> 00:11:37,374
So there are multiple ways base
to encrypt data into the feed,

180
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:38,664
the data to the h and bot.

181
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,804
And you can also preserve.

182
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:42,934
in the format expected by the user.

183
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:49,154
And, deeply integrated integrations
enables users to navigate out

184
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:51,647
and into the chatbot seamlessly.

185
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:55,694
For example, chatbot gets the context
of the activities user has done

186
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:59,514
outside of the chatbot, selection of
a certain component in that selection

187
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:03,344
of the converted interface, which
is totally outside of the chatbot.

188
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:08,524
the context about the user activity is
passed to the chatbot and it readily

189
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:11,964
gets the context and works seamlessly.

190
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:16,904
In conclusion, AI powered chatbots are
transforming platform engineering by

191
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:20,824
automating tasks, enhancing efficiency,
and improving overall user experience.

192
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:25,214
This chatbots bridge critical gaps
in complexity, automation, and real

193
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:28,904
time responsiveness, making platform
engineering more accessible and effective.

194
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:33,674
As we move forward, it is worth
considering how AI chatbots can

195
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:37,574
be integrated into the platform
engineering practices to drive

196
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,514
innovation and operational excellence.

197
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:42,524
Thank you.

198
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:44,704
Thanks for your time.

199
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:50,344
I would like to open the floor
to any questions you might have.
