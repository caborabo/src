1
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:15,070
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,529
How you doing?

3
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:17,860
My name is Victor.

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,819
And today in this particular
course today, I'll be teaching

5
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:25,480
you about, a course, a topic.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,519
I'm talking about a topic called
beyond the code, building cyber

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,720
security awareness in your
platform development team.

8
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:37,510
So if you are looking to inculcate
the best practices into your platform

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,650
development teams, this particular
talk, you would actually find useful.

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,340
By the end of this talk, you should
be able to understand some modern

11
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,090
threats that your team actually
faces as a platform development

12
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,740
team and how to elevate your
security mindset in your team.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,770
So it's important for us to
understand that, the cybersecurity

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,860
landscape is evolving just to where.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,400
We with more, improvement in technology,
there's also going to be improvements

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,570
in security threats, so there's a
rise of sophisticated threats and

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,420
the attack vectors, improving attack
vectors here simply means, the

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,130
means through the channels through
which you can actually be attacked.

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,355
So for instance, things like IOT systems,
for instance, You can actually be hacked

20
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:25,985
through your cameras or maybe your fridge
because fridge freezers and fridges today

21
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:29,035
have I have like I like IoT devices too.

22
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:30,185
They can actually be.

23
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,170
Connected to via the Internet,
and there's also an increasing

24
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,480
reliance on technology today.

25
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:42,270
Lots of organizations, almost
everybody in the world CrowdStrike

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,822
event where because of there was a
downtime with the CrowdStrike system,

27
00:01:46,822 --> 00:01:52,020
airports were shut, airports could
not, their operations were affected.

28
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,500
In the world today, technology
is like the backbone of most

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,580
of the business processes.

30
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,730
yeah, so the first thing to actually
look at when you're talking about

31
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,800
integration security into your
platform development lifecycle is

32
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,030
to have a secure by design mindset.

33
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,225
What it means here for the shift approach
means the fact that, you Make sure that

34
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:15,045
whatever you do when you arrive with
your designs, maybe you are designing

35
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:17,815
a cloud application or a software.

36
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:20,755
For instance, you want to make sure
that it is secure by design, meaning

37
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,305
that you consider security first.

38
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:24,825
It doesn't matter how fancy
whatever your building is.

39
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:27,985
If it's not secure, it can actually
be an attack vector through which

40
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:29,255
your system is going to be attacked.

41
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:33,375
There should also be a secure
testing and analysis piece.

42
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,430
What this means is that you should have
a very good quality assurance process in

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,000
place in your platform development team.

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,570
you shouldn't be in a hurry to
move a product into a, an app or a

45
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,200
software into the production system.

46
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,130
Without adequately testing it, you
should have a very good quality

47
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,240
assurance system or methodology.

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,750
And there are also automated
security tools you can

49
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,010
actually use to achieve this.

50
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,600
And there are also
different methodologies.

51
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,040
You can actually also make sure
you do penetration testing.

52
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,270
Penetration testing means that you
actually get maybe a hacker to, you

53
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,220
get a hacker to actually target your
system to see how, where and where

54
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,530
your system could be vulnerable.

55
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,350
I could also.

56
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:21,125
Do things around statistics, code and
statistics, static code analysis where

57
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,995
you can actually review the source code
or what you do to actually see whether

58
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:28,605
there are any bugs where, for instance,
if there are any bugs that could actually

59
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:34,075
make you prone to being attacked via SQL
injection attack, for instance, those will

60
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:36,515
be identified with a static code analysis.

61
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,600
Process.

62
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,210
it's also very important to you.

63
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,690
That's what you're looking to
have a security conscious culture.

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,640
They should be regular awareness
trainings held in your organization, and

65
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,630
they should openness and transparency.

66
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,240
What this actually means is the
fact that your team should be people

67
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,810
should be encouraged to, speak up
when they feel something is wrong.

68
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,810
Okay, you should encourage an
atmosphere of people speaking up,

69
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,130
people not keeping to themselves
when they feel something is wrong.

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,060
It could be the difference
between you being cyber safe

71
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,210
and you being cyber attacked.

72
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,780
Okay, so it's very important to
encourage a community and ambience of.

73
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,590
Open transparency is very important
for you to maintain security

74
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,370
conscious culture within your team.

75
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,490
incentives could also be provided to
members of your team when a member of

76
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,570
your team, actually does an achievement
or is actually like a cyberspace champion

77
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,669
in the sense that he or she encourages,
The team needs to be more cyber a lot.

78
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:36,519
you could actually sign our words for
those kind of people and give them

79
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:40,249
our words or maybe monetary gift of
our chance to encourage them so that

80
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:43,579
all the members of the team see that
good behavior is actually encouraged.

81
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:45,609
Going back to the secrecy
awareness training.

82
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,569
This is a lot actually been
found that most companies are

83
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:50,979
not doing a lot to, train.

84
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,729
They're not doing a lot to actually train,
their staffs regularly around, Cyber

85
00:04:55,729 --> 00:05:00,039
security trainings and cyber security
trains, so it's not just enough for you

86
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,769
to organize a cyber security training.

87
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,219
When you're onboarding your
staff, you should also make sure

88
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:06,469
that it's a question of process.

89
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:11,619
They should understand the importance of
things around not having a cladex policy.

90
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,909
they should have a cladex policy, things
around changing their passwords regularly,

91
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:18,159
things around not sharing, things
Sensitive, office things when they're

92
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,889
personal social media, things like that.

93
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:24,319
Those are reminders, nudging your staffs
to make sure that they don't become

94
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,679
like an attack vector themselves with
moving towards social engineering.

95
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:32,619
And so in social engineering concepts,
your staffs may actually be an attack

96
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:34,659
vector that you could be hacked from.

97
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,629
So you have to be very careful, You
should also look at implementing secure

98
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,329
coding practice on the technical area.

99
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:42,909
We talk about things
around form validation.

100
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,109
For instance, I spoke about
password for the previous slide.

101
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:51,539
when it comes to things around input
validation, you should say, if you have

102
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:55,984
some sensitive files, For instance, you
could also secure it to the way that

103
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:59,894
the password to access those files would
have certain rules and requirements.

104
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:03,884
For instance, it could be that the
password must be maybe 15 characters long.

105
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:07,339
where you must have a capital letter,
small letter symbols and all that.

106
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,899
So there must be, good input
validation built into your system.

107
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:14,399
There should also be secure authentication
and authorization systems, things

108
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,879
around MFA, multi factor authentication,
to make sure that the person who

109
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,509
is logging in or having access to
sensitive documents, Is supposed to

110
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:22,909
be the person having access to them.

111
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,539
Okay.

112
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,119
So this is very important to know.

113
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:29,669
Then also encryption, it goes without
saying, it cannot be overemphasized

114
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:33,309
and it cannot be understated that
you need to encrypt sensitive files.

115
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,079
Oh, look at the CIA triad.

116
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,559
Things around your confidentiality, your
integrity of your files is so important.

117
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,999
So sensitive details like passwords
or, system like systems in your,

118
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:49,399
In your disposals, you should make
sure that you also inculcate things

119
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,879
around the least privileged access
methodologies where anyone who shouldn't

120
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,709
have any business having access to a
system should not have access to it.

121
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,069
It should be encrypted from them.

122
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:03,829
It's only individuals who would have,
who, who, Authorized to have access

123
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:07,319
to the information who, you can use,
you can say something like around a

124
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:11,319
need to know basis, something around
a need to know basis where it is only

125
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,069
when they have to know that it would
actually have access to actually decrypt

126
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,049
that file and have access to the file.

127
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:17,589
So encryption is very important.

128
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,824
The number four would be
secure logging and monitoring.

129
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,894
This is so important, very important.

130
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:28,684
You need to have a secure logging
system that shows who actually logged,

131
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,384
who actually accessed the resource.

132
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:32,254
And when did they access the resource?

133
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:33,784
It cannot be overemphasized.

134
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:38,074
When you have a cyber attack and you
are doing a post incident recovery, you

135
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:41,619
want to go back and check, actually,
let's be cyber attack who accesses

136
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,429
file who was killing through this file.

137
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:44,629
It will help you investigate.

138
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,969
So there's a need to have a secure logging
system that shows that tracks the time

139
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,319
and whatever anybody did in a system.

140
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:54,479
Some organizational systems around
them use different softwares

141
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,239
to actually track this down.

142
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,859
So you need to check for a software
that actually works for you to project.

143
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:05,244
Then if your physical security of
your platforms, things around your,

144
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:10,194
network security and segmentation,
implementing a firewall is non negotiable.

145
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:16,864
You will need to have interaction systems,
your QALYs, QBM IRADAR, QALYs, DACTRACE.

146
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:20,444
Different options for you to
use from Microsoft Defender.

147
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:23,634
you should also implement
firewalls outside and inside

148
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:24,864
your network if need be.

149
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:28,854
You can also, for some
organizations, I know some , your

150
00:08:28,854 --> 00:08:30,734
staff probably work remote.

151
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:37,574
You probably want get a VAN establish
a site end to in v you secure v and VPN

152
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:41,314
system to ensure that there's enough,
there's a very good segmentation.

153
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:46,079
That helps your remote workers
connect securely to your network,

154
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,589
in such a way that it does not
affect your main usnc files.

155
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:49,929
Okay.

156
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,029
So that is what's network security
and segmentation will help you do.

157
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:55,309
Then best practices.

158
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:56,959
You need to have best practices.

159
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,669
I've spoken about that
in the previous slide.

160
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,869
You even must have a good access,
I didn't say an access management

161
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:06,869
system that talks about your
authorization, access and authorization.

162
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:11,599
people who are logging into
your systems must have the right

163
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,829
login credentials to do Okay.

164
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:17,649
If you log in, if your login process
is broken, you might as well know

165
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,069
that your systems are not safe.

166
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:19,729
Okay.

167
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:23,439
And you should also have to do
regular scanning so that where

168
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,689
and where you are actually weak.

169
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:28,179
It's a good practice to have penetration
testers come to test your systems

170
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,009
regularly to know where you are weak.

171
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:34,859
So you can do that maybe every three
months to check, okay, get a penetration

172
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:36,499
test that will actually test your system.

173
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:41,609
Physical security measures since around
Creating barriers to your systems.

174
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:45,739
you should have guts
in your data sentence.

175
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,489
if you have data centers, if you're
filed on August 10 on the cloud and

176
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:53,869
you have some offline files stored in
data centers, you should have fiscal

177
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:58,349
gaps, fiscal barriers, surveillance
systems, cameras, to protect access

178
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:00,629
to your, your critical infrastructure.

179
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,119
Very important to have all those in
place, and of course you should have an

180
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:08,669
adequate backup, adequate backup measure
in place just in case maybe there's a

181
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,639
fire, so that your systems are not lost.

182
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,849
Make sure you back up
your systems properly.

183
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:17,229
Incident response planning
cannot be overemphasized.

184
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:21,334
you should have In your security
policy organization, there should

185
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:26,924
be, a comprehensive incidents
response plan as regards, the

186
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:31,204
procedures for containing any security
incidents you might actually have.

187
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:35,244
You should have a dedicated team, maybe
outsource dedicated team that would be,

188
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:38,994
Taxed with the responsibility of handling
any incident you might probably encounter

189
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:41,294
in the course of your day to day work.

190
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:41,914
Okay.

191
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:44,564
And of course, there are software
that could actually help you with

192
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:45,844
threat intelligence and analysis.

193
00:10:46,124 --> 00:10:50,864
I've mentioned some like
DuckTrace and IBM Curator.

194
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:53,914
There are lots of them, but you need to
work with what works for your budget.

195
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:54,694
Okay.

196
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:57,644
So incident resource plan, you
should have an incident resource

197
00:10:57,644 --> 00:10:59,564
plan in your security policy.

198
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,389
that shows the appropriate response,
how you are going to actually deal

199
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:07,879
with the incident, how you are going
to do it during the incident and

200
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,289
after the incident, what steps will
be taken so that you don't fall to

201
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:13,059
that same server attack next time.

202
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,089
Very important.

203
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:15,789
yes.

204
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:19,204
So There's a need for continuous
monitoring, you have to continuously

205
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:23,494
monitor your systems, you have to
continue to monitor them because the

206
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:27,514
cyber attackers are not actually sleeping,
so you have to continuously check.

207
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,534
Though some systems will give you
false positives, some softwares

208
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:34,454
like, I know Qualys and some other
systems, sometimes they may throw

209
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:35,614
what they call false positives.

210
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:37,714
which might not actually
be a cyber threat.

211
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:41,264
you want to make sure that you check very
well, you investigate for that, you check

212
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:45,074
the logs and check that, okay, this system
is actually, this is actually not actually

213
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:50,594
a false policy, but if you see anything
unusual in your monitoring and your

214
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:55,534
vulnerability assessment, you raise it
up to your line manager to let them know

215
00:11:55,534 --> 00:11:59,354
what to do so that they can take it up
and actually neutralize any cyber threat.

216
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:05,959
lastly, I would, I want to talk
about Empowering your team.

217
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,569
It's so important for you to take
security awareness training seriously.

218
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:13,719
it is very important to work
on a mindset of your team.

219
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:17,599
They need to understand that cyber
security is everybody's business, not

220
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,019
just the security team's business.

221
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:22,019
Everybody should be cyber aware.

222
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:22,959
Very important.

223
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:25,829
That's why I mentioned
you need to train them.

224
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,529
You need to train your staff.

225
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:31,964
Regularly around security because
he has different security threats

226
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:36,484
coming up every day and your system,
your staffs need to be aware.

227
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:37,554
They should also be.

228
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:40,464
you can also have things
around threat modeling in the

229
00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:42,304
interactive security simulations.

230
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:46,964
You can actually do security simulation
where you check You know, you mimic real

231
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:48,444
world scenarios to help people at it.

232
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,044
So that would help you identify how
you're going to respond to a threat.

233
00:12:52,474 --> 00:12:55,764
You can also, when it comes to security
awareness and training, you can also

234
00:12:55,844 --> 00:13:00,044
conduct fun games, security games,
that can actually, you can give me

235
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:05,274
five security scenarios, true quizzes,
interactive games, challenges, and

236
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:06,624
why your staffs are having fun.

237
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:08,084
They'll be learning things about security.

238
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:08,494
Okay.

239
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:11,884
Just to make them have fun and they will
have that mindset, within them that.

240
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:12,114
Okay.

241
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:16,119
We have actually, we need to be actually
be cyber secure and we need to have

242
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,779
informed, actually learning something.

243
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,719
And with that, you are improving, you
are empowering, the security mindset.

244
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,119
And in conclusion, I just want to say that
it is very possible for you to actually

245
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:30,539
cultivate a security conscious culture
within your platform development team and

246
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:34,469
protect your platform development team
from modern threats so that you can have a

247
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:36,909
resilient cyber posture in your platform.

248
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,169
in your organization.

249
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:39,699
So you need to take this seriously.

250
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,449
And if you aren't doing any of the
things listed in this presentation

251
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:44,999
before, please take out time.

252
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:47,539
You can speak to a cybersecurity
consultant about it.

253
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,859
And I actually hope and believe
that, you will find you have

254
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:52,339
found this presentation useful.

255
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:57,729
And, yes, so it is very, I find I,
I counted the privilege to actually

256
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:01,119
present in conf platform and the conf.

257
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,244
42 plus from engineering 2024 program.

258
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:08,944
And I'm sure that you would, you've
actually found this pretty useful and yes.

259
00:14:09,094 --> 00:14:13,674
So I guess I'll catch up with you another
time and wherever you are in the world,

260
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:15,764
I want to say, have an amazing time.

261
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,504
Thank you very much for listening.
