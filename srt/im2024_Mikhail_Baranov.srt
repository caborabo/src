1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,530
Hi all, my name is Baran Mikhail,
I'm Cybersecurity Team Lead and

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,899
today I'm going to talk about how
we reduce costs by millions with

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,860
strategic security initiatives.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,360
I'd like to start with a
short introduction of myself.

5
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:17,849
I'm Cybersecurity Team Lead with extensive
engineering background and experience.

6
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:21,324
I have over decade, of
experience cybersecurity.

7
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:24,955
I've led the design and implementation
of global security infrastructures.

8
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:30,205
I have extensive experience with risk
management in building up a solid and

9
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:36,115
resilient security teams, establishing
a security operation center, reducing,

10
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:38,350
cybersecurity risks, and, um.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,990
consistently enhancing security
and the patient efficiency

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,710
across international enterprises.

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,109
today's agenda today, I'm
going to speak, about my.

14
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:55,209
experience and how we've managed to
build a solid and resilient cybersecurity

15
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:59,849
framework and infrastructure within the
corporate investment business, one of

16
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:03,969
the biggest corporate investment business
in Europe at the times I'm speaking.

17
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:10,329
And the, All started with the
transformative initiative, that, the

18
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:15,779
main goal, was to fortify defenses
and, As a result, it also, created

19
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:21,799
the, revenue, savings for our
management in terms of, risk reduction

20
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,089
and, buffing against the breaches
and, other cyber criminal activity.

21
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:31,179
today I would like to share, with you
the journey when the took the challenges

22
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:35,089
we faced, the strategies we implemented
and the insights we gained along the way.

23
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,199
let's start from the
beginning, if it should.

24
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:42,459
when I first joined the company,
it was clear that the organization

25
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:46,999
was an, an important turning point
regarding cyber security posture.

26
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:52,619
at the time when I joined, it was a,
solid and global financial institution

27
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:57,519
and a billion of dollars in transactions
annually with billion dollars of revenues.

28
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,939
and, though it was only the
question when the cyber criminals

29
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,989
would start to attack it.

30
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,083
by creating a, security, roadmap.

31
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:13,729
And as we know, cybercriminals were
no longer lone hackers, but organized

32
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:19,159
groups employing advanced persistent
threats, zero day exploits, and some of

33
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,089
them were even state sponsored attacks.

34
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:27,314
Existing cyber security framework
wasn't consistent enough and some

35
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,824
of the aspects were overdue to
counter modern security threats.

36
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:37,104
That was the first critical point we
found out when I joined the company.

37
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:42,774
The lack of consistent unified approach,
not only created the operational

38
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,694
efficiencies, but also left us
vulnerable to a sophisticated attack

39
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:48,684
that could exploit this, disparities.

40
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:53,454
The amount of risks that we found,
during the project and during

41
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:55,634
the transformation was enormous.

42
00:02:55,724 --> 00:03:00,374
while we were counting the potential
losses, we found out that, it could

43
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:03,364
be exceeding 500 million annually.

44
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,559
Due to various data breaches, system
downtime, and non compliance penalties.

45
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:12,289
Moreover, the threat of losing client
trust and market share loomed large.

46
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:16,689
As you probably know, the larger
organization, the, the more

47
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:18,969
painful is, such cases are.

48
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,929
I'm speaking about mostly about the
trust and, relationship with the

49
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:27,969
customers, in terms of, security
breaches and in terms of security.

50
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:32,704
measurements that we took to protect
their assets and, basically money.

51
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:33,204
Right.

52
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:38,564
the United insurgency, we embarked on
a comprehensive project to overhaul

53
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:40,274
our cybersecurity infrastructure.

54
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:42,204
we formed out the goal.

55
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:43,334
The goal was pretty clear.

56
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:46,764
we need to design and implement a
unified resilient security framework

57
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:52,619
that would safeguard our global financial
ops and ensure strict compliance to.

58
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:56,449
internal, international, security
standards such as VFM, PCI,

59
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:02,499
DSS, as a global, again, as a
global financial institution,

60
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,619
adhering to those international
security standards is a must.

61
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:11,874
And none of the, companies, operating
globally could not, adhere to them.

62
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:14,394
the main focus and the goal was that.

63
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:18,184
then we started to identify
vulnerabilities and the risks.

64
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:23,544
The first step, as I said, was it, we
conducted a thorough risk assessment,

65
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:25,039
which involved several key activities.

66
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:28,112
We involved, A lot of people from
the business side, management,

67
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:31,082
infrastructure, compliance.

68
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:37,042
So all the departments were there to help
us, to start our security transformation.

69
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:43,482
so where to start from, our risk
assessment, was divided by five steps.

70
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:48,372
Five critical steps, we've identified
those as network vulnerability

71
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,212
scanning, penetration testing,
security configuration audits,

72
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:56,222
application security testing, and
employee security awareness evaluation.

73
00:04:56,872 --> 00:04:59,492
we started from the network
vulnerability scanning.

74
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:00,102
Why?

75
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:03,112
the answer is Pretty simple.

76
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:09,232
since the, organization is, global,
it should be available from any

77
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:12,072
point of the global or the globe.

78
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:17,572
That means everyone could try
to attack us, scan us, whatever.

79
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:22,212
So we have to be prepared and, secure our
external perimeter as much as possible.

80
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:26,402
we use the advanced vulnerability scanning
tools like wallets or kinetics to perform

81
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:28,322
extensive scans of our infrastructure.

82
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:28,362
Okay.

83
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:33,322
We've identified over 1, 000
vulnerabilities, some of them

84
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,192
were pretty severe and critical.

85
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:40,702
I don't want to share those, due
to, ethics and, NDAs and contracts.

86
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,872
but trust me, those was really, severe.

87
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:47,632
yeah, for instance, we found
system running outdated

88
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:49,882
versions of operating systems.

89
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:53,122
the problem was that, those
systems were externally phased.

90
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:58,702
Which means that, each and every
person out there with malicious intent

91
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:00,822
could easily start to hack them.

92
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:05,672
And that means that would result
in a significant damage to the

93
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:08,162
organization due to breach.

94
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:11,212
The second step was penetration testing.

95
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:14,432
Once again, it was conducted
both in external and internal

96
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:16,092
infrastructure and applications.

97
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:19,982
First of all, we started with
validation of, discovered and,

98
00:06:20,002 --> 00:06:21,052
identified vulnerabilities.

99
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:28,362
We conducted a penetration testing
using tools like Metasploit, Blurb, Kali

100
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:31,292
Linux, and many other testing techniques.

101
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:34,972
We focused on confirming
the most critical one.

102
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:39,817
Additionally, our application
security team simulated attacks

103
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,377
to exploit vulnerabilities.

104
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:49,637
That allowed us to track the
events that occur once the external

105
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:52,067
attacker would like to penetrate us.

106
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:56,612
So that also enhanced our security
operation center and security

107
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:58,597
operation center playbooks.

108
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:02,297
So we were ready to act if
something like that happens.

109
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:09,952
Further, we are now prepared, this
exercise highlighted the potential for

110
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:15,882
a malicious actor to cause significant
damage and, that allowed us to, have

111
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:22,502
the, management attention as much as
possible to, to close off those risk

112
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:25,152
or at least to, start remediation.

113
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:31,082
Then we began with security configuration
audits of our infrastructure.

114
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:35,052
We performed detailed audits of our
security configurations, including

115
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:38,682
firewalls, servers, endpoints, pretty
much everything that we had inside.

116
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:45,572
we even, assessed our Bluetooth mouse
and keyboards and headphones, in the

117
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,932
offices, because those could be also.

118
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:55,302
A part of, security, security attack
surface, we found several critical

119
00:07:55,302 --> 00:08:01,082
misconfigurations is the low, any
to the, external, destinations.

120
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:03,645
And this configuration is good.

121
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:04,452
Have a load attackers.

122
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:08,122
Concentrate our network and
exfiltrate data without the detection.

123
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:12,222
It also highlighted us a area
where it should be focused.

124
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:16,182
On further, to harden our infrastructure.

125
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:18,982
We've used, advanced tools for that.

126
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:20,372
I'll speak about them later.

127
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:21,892
All right.

128
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:27,352
the first one application security
testing, we had the in house development

129
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:33,152
team, as part of the development, they,
created the web applications, mobile

130
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:37,592
applications, and the rest, of course,
external interface, of course, APIs.

131
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:42,057
facing our customers
and, not only customers.

132
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:47,387
we started to analyze and test
those in terms of security.

133
00:08:47,787 --> 00:08:52,747
We used, both static and dynamic
application, security tools, Avast ZAP.

134
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:55,997
We've uncovered several critical
vulnerabilities, like cross site

135
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,267
scripting and secure API endpoints.

136
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:03,817
I'm speaking mostly about the, Improper
authentication the requests, especially

137
00:09:04,097 --> 00:09:08,647
inside of the, authorized area, right
after the client logins, after the client

138
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:11,427
enters his credentials and all the stuff.

139
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:16,717
So inside, mostly those vulnerabilities
were found there, as well as,

140
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:23,667
improper input validation on several
fields within the registration

141
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:24,787
form in spite of onboarding.

142
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:26,997
All right, so the tips.

143
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:33,917
And the last one, companies consider
people as similar asset as the server,

144
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:36,927
as the cash on the balance and the rest.

145
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:43,267
the last point here, but probably the
last point in the risk assessment part,

146
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:45,747
but the first in terms of defense.

147
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:52,097
because, as we know, 95 percent of
successful attacks started with social

148
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:57,207
engineering, which means that, the,
humans are the weakest part in terms of

149
00:09:57,357 --> 00:10:00,007
security posture within the organization.

150
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:04,832
We started with, basic phishing
tests, and phishing simulations.

151
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,242
the results were concerning.

152
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:11,082
Most of the employees, 35 percent
of the employees clicked on phishing

153
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:15,472
links and then provided their login
credentials and fake, login pages.

154
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:19,817
Which is very bad in terms of,
security, gate, the first security

155
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,367
gate of the defense, right?

156
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:22,457
Of the defense in depth.

157
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:27,337
that also underscored the need of
security, advanced training and

158
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,567
security, security awareness management.

159
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:36,337
After we've performed all those risk
assessments, we needed to present

160
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:39,397
these findings in a way that would
resonate with the executive leadership.

161
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:44,792
By quantifying the risks in financial
terms, we've illustrated the potential

162
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,842
impact, and you'd be surprised.

163
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:52,674
the financial exposure, the potential
losses exceeding 500 million annually

164
00:10:52,674 --> 00:10:55,440
due to breaches, fraud, and downtime.

165
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,172
Regulatory penalties, non compliance
with standards like SWIFT and PCI DSS

166
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:03,672
could result in fines up to 50 million.

167
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:09,737
and of course, reputational damage,
loss of client trust could lead to

168
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:14,917
a 15, decrease in market share and
that's an equity up to hundreds

169
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,407
of millions and loss of revenue.

170
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:21,347
The question was, how are
we going to mitigate those?

171
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:26,807
The answer was pretty simple, we had
a strategic cybersecurity initiatives.

172
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:31,187
Armed with those information, we
developed a comprehensive cybersecurity

173
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:34,137
strategy focusing on several key areas.

174
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:38,567
The first one, related to
network, was related to network

175
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:41,117
segmentation and micro segmentation.

176
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:45,197
We divided the network into separate
segments based on function and

177
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:46,667
sensitivity using reliance, subnets.

178
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:51,802
using additional compliance checks
on the device before they enter

179
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,352
the network perimeter office.

180
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:59,852
office when the person comes in
person in the office, not the,

181
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:02,122
working from home, kind of thing.

182
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:05,632
The second was micro segmentation.

183
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:09,202
We used software defined networking
technologies like Illumio.

184
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:12,512
We enforced granular the workload level.

185
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:16,892
Each application and service was isolated,
and communication was strictly controlled.

186
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:23,082
This strategy appeared to be a zero trust
model, where no network traffic is trusted

187
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,052
by default, and every communication
is authenticated and authorized.

188
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:32,842
That was the first break in our
cybersecurity framework and strategy

189
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:39,592
that allowed to reduce lateral movement
and other risks that were related

190
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:44,072
to insecure communications within
the network and potential breaches.

191
00:12:44,082 --> 00:12:46,912
So that was more a proactive measure.

192
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,177
Rather than the, detective

193
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:55,967
then, using the cutting edge technologies,
AI and machine learning, we started

194
00:12:56,227 --> 00:13:00,337
to move forward using the S I M.

195
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:05,607
we deployed advanced the same
solutions like a, LK with dark trace.

196
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:09,787
And we integrated them both,
enhance them with machine learning.

197
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:09,857
Thank you.

198
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:14,781
And, started using AI, which
was provided by ALK mostly.

199
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,312
We started to analyze the
log data in real time.

200
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:21,942
This allowed us to detect anomalies
and potential threats that

201
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,262
traditional systems might miss.

202
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:32,442
And, spoiler alert, several incidents,
haven't happened exactly because of that.

203
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:39,532
again, since the people, the most, the
biggest asset within the organization

204
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:44,582
in terms of security, we started to
integrate with the user and entity

205
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:49,012
behavior analytics, by establishing
baseline behavior patterns for users and

206
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:51,032
device, we could identify deviations.

207
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:52,626
Indicating of malicious activity.

208
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:56,624
For example, if an employee account
suddenly started accessing large volumes

209
00:13:56,624 --> 00:14:00,986
of data at unusual hours, the system
would flag this for investigation.

210
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:04,258
We started to harden our
endpoints, by implementing endpoint

211
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:09,028
detection and response, recognizing that
endpoints are common entry points for

212
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:11,253
attackers with deployed DDR solutions.

213
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:16,693
And they were installed on all endpoints
without any exception, together without

214
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:21,283
our CIM providing real time monitoring
and automated response for the threats.

215
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:28,533
That also allowed us to perform an
automated isolation, again, in conjunction

216
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:33,983
with, Cutting edge technologies like
ML and AI, if an endpoint exhibited

217
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:38,853
suspicious behavior, it could be
automatically isolated from the network

218
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:40,063
to prevent the spread of malware.

219
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,523
identity and access management.

220
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:48,693
Additional brick in our cyber
security framework and our resilient

221
00:14:50,763 --> 00:14:54,553
To strengthen our access controls, we
implemented multi factor authentication

222
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:59,243
implemented across all critical
systems to add an extra layer of

223
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:03,253
protection beyond classic passwords.

224
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,823
Additionally, we've implemented it
with Microsoft SSO and Azure SSO, which

225
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,553
allowed us to control the access at
one point without any problems in terms

226
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:18,523
of revoking access, providing access,

227
00:15:19,523 --> 00:15:21,003
Role based access control.

228
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:25,603
Another thing that is pretty much basic.

229
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,743
Ensuring that employers have
access only to the resources

230
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:30,993
necessary for their roles.

231
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:35,013
Minimizing the risk of unauthorized
access and privilege creep.

232
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:38,123
Security orchestration
automation and response.

233
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:42,813
Another tool that allowed
us to enhance and embrace

234
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,683
automation to enhance efficiency.

235
00:15:45,463 --> 00:15:49,983
Automated incident response using
SOAR platform with automated responses

236
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,653
to commonly security incidents.

237
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:55,693
As an example, we've created several
scripts for containment after

238
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,433
triggers on endpoints and servers.

239
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:00,803
Playbooks, that's a common thing.

240
00:16:01,313 --> 00:16:04,943
But when we started, we understood
that we have to dive deep, each,

241
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:10,553
case to develop a sophisticated
playbook to respond to incidents.

242
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:15,553
Develop standardized procedures for
handling different types of incidents,

243
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:19,343
ensuring a consistent and swift
response based on metering matrix.

244
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:26,793
And especially for our, we've done that
mostly for our SLC operation center.

245
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:29,503
Compliance and standardization.

246
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:32,523
To address inconsistencies across regions.

247
00:16:32,673 --> 00:16:39,453
we have to perform, another audit,
but more focused on, compliance side.

248
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:47,213
policy standardization, that's the thing
we started from because that's the, soil

249
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:49,333
ground for each and every organization.

250
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:55,598
to have basic procedures and
policies and standards unified and

251
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,978
aligned within the organization.

252
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:01,568
We created a centralized security
policy management system.

253
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:05,798
All regions are required to adhere
to the same security standards,

254
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:07,618
reducing gaps in our defenses.

255
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,088
And of course, international
standards compliance.

256
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:19,818
Aligned our control with frameworks
like ISO 27001 SWIFT, customer security

257
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:23,078
program, and the others like, NIST,

258
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:28,558
that also improved, security,
but also simplified.

259
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:35,228
Compliance reporting, those are
worldwide known standards and, those

260
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:39,998
who are created, by best practices
and, based on security experience

261
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:44,068
for the past 20 plus years, right?

262
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:48,258
That's quite a solid, term in
terms of, experience again.

263
00:17:49,948 --> 00:17:50,798
Employee training and awareness.

264
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:55,678
the first thing it's understanding
the importance of the human element,

265
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,388
mandatory training programs.

266
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:59,228
So of course, no one likes them, right?

267
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:00,748
But still there should be some.

268
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:05,268
We launched a comprehensive cyber
security training for all employees.

269
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:06,078
We gamified.

270
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:07,318
our.

271
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:15,153
Users won't be just staring on the
presentation on pictures, but they

272
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:17,583
were like games, so they enjoyed it.

273
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:24,203
At the end, they would receive a badge
and achievement, so they successfully

274
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:29,023
passed and they could be proud of it.

275
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:33,203
Then we started to perform regular
simulation just to train our users.

276
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:39,268
Because even if we, if we see that the
user was, successfully phished and,

277
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:44,868
entered his credentials to a malicious
website, we still could train him.

278
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:52,698
So that's like the, a chance for
both of us, for us to change our.

279
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:58,308
Training system in case it wasn't
successful enough and sufficient

280
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:04,648
enough, so the user was over the
time, the, we reduced the click rate

281
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:06,238
and fishing numbers from 35 to 5%.

282
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:13,308
And you can imagine how happy we
were once we tracked this five

283
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:15,868
person for more than three months.

284
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:22,358
So trust me, that's quite an achievement
for any security professional out there.

285
00:19:24,823 --> 00:19:31,613
I'd like to share some cases and successes
within, Our boss to stable and resilient

286
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:33,843
security within the organization.

287
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:38,153
So the first one was a part in
an advanced resistant threat.

288
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:45,663
As I said earlier, that was only a
question of time when, APT will target us.

289
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:51,653
And try to breach, we found that one
APT group targeted our organization,

290
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:56,263
attempted to infiltrate our infrastructure
through spear phishing emails,

291
00:19:56,313 --> 00:19:59,523
containing malicious attachments,
exploiting zero day vulnerabilities.

292
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:04,073
That was, our, one of
our C level employees.

293
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:10,423
For, some period of time, he
received several phishing emails.

294
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:13,653
And accidentally clicked on it.

295
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:19,870
we use detection tools, as I
mentioned, AI and ML powered SIM,

296
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:24,893
ELK, detected unusual email patterns
and flagged them for investigation.

297
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:30,543
additionally, we found in our
threat intelligence that, compute

298
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:37,163
PC of, our employee tried to
reach, IP with a bad reputation.

299
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:42,093
Our automated SOR playbooks,
for untied the suspicious emails

300
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:44,503
and alerted the security team.

301
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:50,803
but only after the email was clicked,
unfortunately, but by neutralizing

302
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:55,023
the threat before any damage to
cure, we prevented potential losses.

303
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:56,973
between the.

304
00:20:57,698 --> 00:21:05,058
Email was still open, but after it
was open, it was quarantine and the.

305
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:10,678
The device was isolated for further
investigation as soon as possible.

306
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:13,908
So there were no damage.

307
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:21,398
yeah, that was one of the cases where
all of our bricks, except again,

308
00:21:22,168 --> 00:21:24,398
first one, the people, succeeded.

309
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:30,243
The second case I would like
to share, it's also related to,

310
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:34,596
cutting edge technologies, and,
how they, Increasing efficiency

311
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:37,736
in terms of responding to threats.

312
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:42,116
an employee inadvertently
downloaded ransomware that

313
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:43,796
attempted to encrypt network shares.

314
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:47,076
that was a, I remember it as today.

315
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,776
That was a late evening.

316
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:54,776
I received the email and, alert
that our EDR system, identified

317
00:21:54,886 --> 00:21:58,016
that no file encryption activities
on one of our, network shares.

318
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:03,186
devices and, network shares,
try to access network shares,

319
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:05,126
with, elevation, pre reached.

320
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:09,256
the infected endpoint was automatically
isolated and files were restored

321
00:22:09,306 --> 00:22:11,376
from, secure backups, storage.

322
00:22:12,756 --> 00:22:17,846
Again, that's the, an example
when the threat entered our

323
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:23,586
infrastructure by phishing,
phishing, social engineering, right?

324
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:30,351
later on we've identified that was a
fake, adverts, advertisement about one

325
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:32,691
of the popular messengers out there.

326
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:39,211
So yeah, this is again an
example of how ML and advanced AI

327
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:43,591
technologies could help you with
identifying and react proactively.

328
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:48,241
to, to issues and to threats that
could reach your infrastructure.

329
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,571
Outcome was pretty simple.

330
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,071
It was pretty straightforward, right?

331
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:57,561
Zero data loss and no runs on
failed, saving approximately

332
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,461
5 million on potential costs.

333
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:06,056
Later on in the news, we found out
that several companies in our, industry

334
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:11,816
faced those issues and, some of them
paid, some of them, faced, significant

335
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:17,726
disruption of, services provided
to the customers and therefore lost

336
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:20,946
revenue and customer trust as well.

337
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,096
Through this experience, we
gained valuable insights.

338
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:29,361
First of all, proactive risk
management is essential.

339
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:31,211
Automation enhances efficiency.

340
00:23:31,731 --> 00:23:33,011
Standardization reduces vulnerabilities.

341
00:23:33,951 --> 00:23:35,511
Aligning security with business goals.

342
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:38,671
I'll start with the
proactive risk management.

343
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:42,541
It's an essential thing
within any organization.

344
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:47,461
Regular risk assessments and
continuous monitoring are critical.

345
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:53,381
Being proactive can help you to
identify and address vulnerabilities

346
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:54,481
before they are exploited.

347
00:23:57,071 --> 00:24:02,551
But what if any vulnerability is
still there and is being exploited?

348
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,761
Like zero day, right?

349
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:11,001
Automation doesn't replace human expertise
and such, but by automating routine

350
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:18,091
tasks, responses, basic security tasks,
our security team could focus on more

351
00:24:18,151 --> 00:24:20,211
complex threats and strategic initiatives.

352
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:27,421
Standardization within the infrastructure,
within the assets, within the

353
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:28,891
everything inside the organization.

354
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:33,001
Consistent security practices
across all regions eliminate gaps

355
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:34,321
that attackers could exploit.

356
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:37,471
It also simplifies compliance
efforts and audits.

357
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:44,546
Once again, plenty of the standards
would simplify cybersecurity team life

358
00:24:44,756 --> 00:24:47,456
within the organization quite much.

359
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:53,636
I'm speaking about ISO, NIST,
and other regulations that are

360
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:56,756
worldwide known and could be used
in each and every organization.

361
00:24:57,086 --> 00:24:59,766
Those could be tuned based on your needs.

362
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:05,806
Your organization could start benefit
from those right from the beginning, right

363
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:07,606
from the start of the implementation.

364
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:12,621
The fourth one, it's aligning
security with business goals.

365
00:25:13,031 --> 00:25:18,431
Again, security is more a support
department, I would say, right?

366
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:22,161
Security should not
interfere with the business.

367
00:25:22,351 --> 00:25:27,011
Security initiatives should support
business objectives, not the otherwise.

368
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:31,028
By demonstrating how security
enhances customer trust and

369
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:35,486
protective revenue, we gain support
from leadership and stakeholders.

370
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:41,356
Which means they have, we are able
to prove management that security

371
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:44,146
really works and saves money.

372
00:25:45,906 --> 00:25:49,226
Saving money is one of the
point in increasing revenue.

373
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:53,566
So for business, it was
quite straightforward.

374
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:56,206
We save money, we increase our revenue.

375
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:01,866
We increase customer
trust, we increase revenue.

376
00:26:02,746 --> 00:26:03,151
If you fail.

377
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,111
That means our revenue goes down.

378
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:07,031
So the security is quite important.

379
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:14,141
so by analyzing those, we analyzed
and came to a point where we should

380
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:21,771
present the financial impact that
was created by security initiatives.

381
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,631
we avoided losses.

382
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:29,701
Operational savings, downtime
reductions, and return on investments.

383
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:36,201
The, what it was, this
were over 90 millions.

384
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:44,821
That was quite impressive, but financial
impact is not the only thing that was

385
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:50,841
increased and improved after we performed
all those and completed all those.

386
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:52,501
security initiatives.

387
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:56,211
Our efforts also bolstered our reputation.

388
00:26:56,371 --> 00:27:03,291
We achieved compliance, we obtained ISO
27001 and completed SWIFT, enhancing

389
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:08,081
our credibility with our customers and
within the business industry as well.

390
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:15,241
So we really made one step up in terms
of our maturity as an organization.

391
00:27:16,091 --> 00:27:22,151
Customer retention, client confidence
led to 7 percent increase in customer

392
00:27:22,736 --> 00:27:28,306
retention, contributing to revenue
growth that's related not only to,

393
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:34,846
business customers, I mean like financial
organization, but regular clients as well.

394
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:36,486
It's all I've said.

395
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:41,716
I would like to share the recommendations
for implementation of the sharing

396
00:27:41,716 --> 00:27:45,726
all this journey and all these
obstacles and problems I've mentioned.

397
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:51,166
So the first and most important
thing is to invest in.

398
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:55,071
Security and investing
in advanced technology.

399
00:27:55,461 --> 00:27:59,101
These technologies can process
vast amounts of data and identify

400
00:27:59,531 --> 00:28:01,031
patterns that humans might miss.

401
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:04,371
That's one more important topic here.

402
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:08,041
I'd like to mention, we
are all people, right?

403
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:13,656
all people have, a maximum
amount of energy they can spend

404
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:15,255
during the working day, right?

405
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:21,846
People can't work 100 percent
efficient, throughout, 8, 9, 10 hours.

406
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:26,356
This is where technology and
advanced technology like AI and

407
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:27,776
machine learning comes in handy.

408
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:31,606
The second one is implement
layered security, of course.

409
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:34,526
It's adopted in defense
and death strategy.

410
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:40,266
Zero trust, using multiple, security
measures and, different layers to

411
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:42,666
protect against various types of threats.

412
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:50,756
That's That will become basic in, I
would say in one year that will become

413
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:55,306
base, a basic thing for each and
every organization, even in startups.

414
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:59,256
The third thing, there
should be a standardization.

415
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:03,206
You have to standardize security
protocols, ensure that security

416
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:07,656
policies and procedures are consistent
across all regions and departments.

417
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:11,058
Of course, there could be deviations
based on, local government,

418
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:15,397
local government rules, policies,
internal policies, and the rest.

419
00:29:16,347 --> 00:29:20,197
But still those should be
standardized, standardized, this reduce

420
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:21,987
vulnerabilities and simplify compliance.

421
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:26,987
The fourth point, foster a
security conscious culture.

422
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:31,827
again, people is the main asset within
the organization, similar to cash

423
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:39,497
on the balance, and, as confirmed
by two cases, that's the weakest

424
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:45,407
part in every security within the
organization, within any organization.

425
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:48,627
Each company should invest in regular
training and awareness programs,

426
00:29:48,757 --> 00:29:52,937
empowering employees to be the first
line of defense against cyber threats.

427
00:29:54,547 --> 00:29:56,547
And the fifth point, alignment.

428
00:29:57,157 --> 00:30:02,677
Alignment of security strategy
with business strategy.

429
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:06,737
Strategy and, value of cyber security
should be communicated in business terms.

430
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:13,027
None of the business representatives
within any department except

431
00:30:13,027 --> 00:30:19,767
technology do understand the risk
of, for example, lateral movement.

432
00:30:20,037 --> 00:30:23,267
my advice here is to demonstrate
how security initiatives protect

433
00:30:23,537 --> 00:30:28,247
revenue, enhance customer trust,
and support growth by quantifying

434
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:31,132
the risk of lateral movement.

435
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:38,432
and quantifying the measures that
were, developed and how they support

436
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:44,782
the business strategy within the
one, two, or maybe three years.

437
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:47,022
It depends on each and
every organization again.

438
00:30:49,252 --> 00:30:52,942
So I would like to conclude
here, in today's interconnected

439
00:30:53,172 --> 00:30:56,972
world, vast and rapidly growing.

440
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:01,942
Each and every industry, especially
financial industry, cybersecurity

441
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:04,582
is not just a technical issue
for the business no more.

442
00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:06,632
It's a fundamental business concern.

443
00:31:07,052 --> 00:31:11,062
Our journey demonstrates that with
a strategic approach, it's possible

444
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:15,182
to significantly reduce risks and
achieve substantial financial savings.

445
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:19,797
By identifying vulnerabilities,
implementing advanced security measures,

446
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:23,837
and fostering a culture of security
awareness, we protected our assets

447
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:25,397
and supported our company growth.

448
00:31:26,137 --> 00:31:29,427
I hope our expertise provides
valuable insight that you can

449
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,077
apply within your own organization.

450
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:36,467
Cybersecurity is a continuous journey, and
staying ahead of evolving threats requires

451
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:38,547
commitment, innovation, and collaboration.

452
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:42,387
What are your thoughts
about the conference today?

453
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:44,527
I am happy to answer any
questions you might have.

454
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:46,357
And thank you for your attention.

455
00:31:46,577 --> 00:31:47,537
It was lovely to have you.

456
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:48,237
Thank you.
