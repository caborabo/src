1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,399
Today I would be talking about
ethical considerations in AI

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,170
enhanced marketing automation.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,799
How to balance personalization
and responsibility.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,990
Today there are a bunch of topics
that we're going to talk about.

5
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:19,890
To start with, the AI
revolution in marketing.

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,809
AI tools like machine learning, natural
language processing, and predictive

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,949
analytics allow marketers to deliver
personalized experiences at scale.

8
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:36,425
84 percent of marketing leaders
believe AI will revolutionize

9
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:38,695
marketing within the next five years.

10
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:40,425
And this is from a source.

11
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:45,635
AI driven marketing enhances customer
targeting, improves engagement,

12
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:47,425
and provides deep insights.

13
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,474
into customer behavior.

14
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:55,754
And there has been a case study that's
done for a, from a retail company.

15
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,904
A retail company used AI powered
recommendations resulting in a

16
00:00:59,915 --> 00:01:04,084
40 percent increase in conversion
rates and 30 percent reduction

17
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:06,114
in customer acquisition costs.

18
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:11,114
We're also going to talk about ethical
dynamics in AI driven marketing.

19
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:14,894
Key ethical issues in
AI enhanced marketing.

20
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:18,114
Consumer behavior manipulation.

21
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:25,554
AI personalizes ads and content based
on individual preferences, but there

22
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:30,224
are concerns that this could manipulate
consumer decisions without them realizing.

23
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:35,514
For example, AI driven algorithms
exploit psychological vulnerabilities

24
00:01:35,714 --> 00:01:39,404
to nudge users into making
purchases or engaging with content.

25
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,124
And the massive data collection
that's happening today required for

26
00:01:44,134 --> 00:01:47,364
AI to function effectively raises
concerns about privacy and potential

27
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,814
misuse of personal information.

28
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:55,444
78 percent of the consumers worry about
AI marketing's aspect on their privacy.

29
00:01:56,144 --> 00:01:59,234
AI can accurately predict sensitive
information like political

30
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:00,654
views or personal preferences.

31
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:05,984
Dissemination of disinformation.

32
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:11,914
AI algorithms, especially on social media
platforms, may amplify fake news and

33
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:14,504
misleading content to drive engagement.

34
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:20,114
For example, AI generated content
today is more, is more often shared

35
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:25,754
across the social media, more
than the verified content leading

36
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,154
to widespread misinformation.

37
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:33,644
AI personalizes recommendations
and ads based on consumer behavior

38
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,814
preferences and online activity
leading to higher engagement.

39
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:41,654
Today, personalized AI recommendations
can increase click through rates by

40
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:44,994
35 percent and conversions by 18%.

41
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:51,544
And a study suggests that 91 percent
of the consumer are most more likely

42
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:55,224
to shop with brands that offer
personalized offers and recommendations.

43
00:02:56,214 --> 00:03:00,624
However, the use of AI to influence
consumer behavior raises ethical concerns.

44
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,659
Some argue that AI can exploit consumer
emotions, biases, effectively manipulating

45
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:06,999
their decision making process.

46
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:09,949
The need for ethical concern.

47
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:15,229
AI's ability to nudge consumers into
actions, such as purchases, sign ups,

48
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:19,134
without them fully understanding the
influence on their decisions, challenges,

49
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,194
the principle of consumer autonomy.

50
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:27,704
There are, and today we're
talking about privacy breaches.

51
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:29,354
Data collection consent.

52
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:33,464
AI marketing relies heavily on
collecting vast amounts of consumer data,

53
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:37,724
including browsing behavior, purchasing
patterns, and personal preferences.

54
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:43,964
Statistics say that 78 percent of
consumers express concerns about how AI

55
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:45,944
powered marketing affects their privacy.

56
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:50,544
For example, AI algorithms have been
able to accurately predict personal

57
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:55,374
information such as political affiliations
with 87 percent accuracy, just by

58
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:57,294
analyzing social media activity.

59
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:02,414
Privacy breaches such as unauthorized
use of personal data and large scale

60
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:07,034
data leaks have become more frequent
as AI systems grow more sophisticated.

61
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:13,414
In 2023, there's a major social
media platform experienced a data

62
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:18,344
breach that exposed the biometric
data of over 150 million users.

63
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:26,604
The spread of disinformation, AI's role in
amplifying misinformation, AI algorithms

64
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:31,514
prioritize engaging content, sometimes
leading to unintentional amplification

65
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,304
of false or misleading information.

66
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:38,404
For example, AI generated fake news is 70
percent more likely to be shared on social

67
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:40,264
media than the accurate news stories.

68
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:47,724
In 2024 US presidential election,
38 percent of Americans encountered

69
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,634
AI generated political content with
62 percent believing it to be real.

70
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:57,864
In a real world consequence, in
2023, a corporate smear campaign

71
00:04:57,874 --> 00:05:01,884
using AI generated deepfakes led
to a 15 percent drop in the stock

72
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,374
price of a targeted company.

73
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:09,414
Fact checking AI tools are being
developed to counteract this issue, but

74
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:13,814
the speed and the scale at which the
disinformation spreads remain a challenge.

75
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,874
Facebook's AI driven fact checking
system identifies and labels 85

76
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:22,919
percent of false and false content
within 24 hours of posting.

77
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:27,519
Let's talk about responsible AI practices.

78
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:31,549
One of the most important
thing is transparency.

79
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:36,209
82 percent of consumers want companies
to be open about how AI is using

80
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:40,179
marketing decisions, especially
around personalized pricing, product

81
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:42,219
recommendations, and targeted ads.

82
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:49,219
And marketers also must clearly explain
how AI systems make decisions enabling

83
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:51,439
consumers to make informed choices.

84
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,419
How to mitigate biasing?

85
00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:00,169
AI models can introduce or perpetuate
biases, especially in ad targeting,

86
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,789
pricing and personalization.

87
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,919
Proactive bias reduction
techniques are essential.

88
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,239
And there's a case study
on bias mitigation.

89
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:14,359
Bias mitigation can be reduced
targeting disparities by 45 percent

90
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:15,629
in a major advertising platform.

91
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:24,459
And human oversight is definitely needed
until an AI system is mature enough.

92
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:29,329
Automated AI systems can make decisions
rapidly, but human oversight ensures

93
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,069
accountability and ethical alignment.

94
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:34,269
Impact of AI on social media.

95
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:41,289
AI's influence on social media are
echo chambers and filter bubbles.

96
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,209
AI algorithms isolate users
in one sided content bubbles.

97
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:50,174
and personalized content filters
limit exposures to diverse viewpoints.

98
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:55,074
And the solution to these echo
chambers and filter bubbles is to

99
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:59,764
introduce algorithmic diversity and
user controlled content curation.

100
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:00,164
I

101
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:05,299
think going forward there has to be a way
to balance innovation with innovation.

102
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,819
and ethics together.

103
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:13,519
Finding the balance between
personalization and responsibility.

104
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:19,159
Companies need AI frameworks that promote
transparency, fairness, and oversight.

105
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:24,099
Responsible AI practices
ensure personalization without

106
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,009
compromising consumer rights.

107
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,399
Balancing innovation with
ethical marketing is essential

108
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,749
for long term sustainability.

109
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:37,674
Today, to conclude the rapid
Advancement of AI has revolutionized

110
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:41,544
marketing by offering unprecedented
personalization and efficiency.

111
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:45,924
However, as AI systems become more
integrated into marketing strategies,

112
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:51,444
businesses must acknowledge the ethical
dilemmas that accompany this technology.

113
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,299
Issues such as consumer manipulation,
privacy breaches, and spread of

114
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,609
disinformation highlight the importance
of developing responsible AI practices.

115
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:06,059
It is critical for companies to strike a
balance between the benefits of AI driven

116
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:11,239
personalization and the need to protect
consumer rights, autonomy, and trust.

117
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:16,439
Responsible AI in marketing
requires a comprehensive approach,

118
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:19,539
emphasizing transparency,
accountability, and humor oversight.

119
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:25,159
Marketers must ensure that AI
algorithms are free from bias

120
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:31,389
data collection practices respect
privacy and disinformation is

121
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:33,449
not unintentionally amplified.

122
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:35,889
Thank you
