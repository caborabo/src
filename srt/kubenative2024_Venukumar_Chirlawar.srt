00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:33,479
security and modern enterprises.

39
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,800
As I mentioned, the cloud computing
market is projected to reach 1.

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,180
3 trillion by 2025.

41
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,200
Underscoring the critical need
for robust security measures.

42
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,319
As organizations continue to

43
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:54,469
infrastructure to the cloud, new
security challenges arise that require

44
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,130
specialized strategies and tools.

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,720
This rapid growth of cloud adoption
has made cloud security a top

46
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,500
priority for businesses of all sizes.

47
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:08,325
Securing sensitive information,
ensuring compliance with data protection

48
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:12,075
regulations, and preventing unauthorized
access to cloud resources have become

49
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:16,845
essential to maintaining business
continuity and safeguarding reputations.

50
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:21,595
To effectively address these
challenges, organizations must move

51
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:26,295
beyond traditional security approaches
and embrace a more comprehensive

52
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:27,695
multi layer protection strategy.

53
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:31,785
This is the focus of this
presentation today as we explore

54
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:33,125
the various levels of security.

55
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,920
that are crucial for securing the cloud.

56
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,600
Now let's dive into the specific
security challenges that organizations

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,359
face in cloud computing environments.

58
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:47,929
The transition to the cloud introduces
a range of security challenges

59
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,670
that organizations must navigate.

60
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,709
Some of the key challenges include
data breaches, which can result

61
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,709
from improper access controls or
vulnerabilities in cloud based

62
00:03:58,709 --> 00:03:59,860
applications and infrastructure.

63
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:05,474
Insecure APIs, which can expose cloud
resources to potential exploitation

64
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:09,534
by attackers, insider threats,
where malicious actors bypass

65
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:12,964
traditional security measures to
access sensitive data and systems.

66
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:18,954
Additionally, organizations must
ensure compliance with data protection

67
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:23,804
regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA,
which can be particularly complex

68
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:25,224
in the dynamic cloud environment.

69
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:29,135
Understanding these challenges is
crucial for developing effective

70
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:32,215
security strategies and safeguarding
your cloud based operations.

71
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:36,455
With this context in mind, let's now
explore the multilayered protection

72
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:39,905
approach, which is designed to address
these diverse threats and vulnerabilities.

73
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:40,374
The

74
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:48,674
multilayered protection approach in
cloud computing involves implementing

75
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:52,235
security measures at various levels
within the cloud environment.

76
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:57,115
This holistic strategy ensures that if one
layer of security is compromised, others

77
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,625
remain intact to protect the system.

78
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:03,934
The importance of a multilayered
security approach lies in its ability

79
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,999
to address a wide range of threats.

80
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,040
from data breaches and API
vulnerabilities which ensure against

81
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,420
vulnerabilities like insider threats,
complex challenges, et cetera.

82
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,820
By combining multiple layers of
protection, organizations create a

83
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,710
comprehensive security framework that
is difficult for attackers to penetrate.

84
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,736
The key layers of protection we'll
be discussing include network

85
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:30,830
security, application security,
data encryption, identity and access

86
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,260
management, and inbound protection.

87
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:36,095
Each layer serves a specific
purpose working together to

88
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:38,985
provide robust and resilient
security for cloud based resources.

89
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:44,125
To better visualize how these layers
work together, let's take a look at

90
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,955
the flowchart that illustrates the
flow of data through various security

91
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:49,295
layers in a cloud environment.

92
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:52,955
This flowchart demonstrates how data
moves through the different security

93
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:54,145
layers in a cloud environment.

94
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,470
As data enters the cloud, it first
encounters the network security

95
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,360
layer, which controls and filters
inbound outbound traffic based

96
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,100
on predefined security tools.

97
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,150
The data then passes through
the application security layer,

98
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,410
where secure coding practices and
vulnerability management measures

99
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,150
are implemented to protect cloud
based applications from attacks.

100
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,530
Next, the data encryption layer
ensures the confidentiality and

101
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,900
integrity of the information.

102
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,340
Both at rest and in transit as well
through the use of encryption standards

103
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,190
and robust key management practices.

104
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,590
Also the identity and access management.

105
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,430
Is responsible for controlling
who can access cloud resources and

106
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,330
under what conditions, helping to
prevent unauthorized access and

107
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,050
ensures which ensures accountability.

108
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,100
Finally, the endpoint protection
layer safeguards to devices such

109
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,890
as laptops, mobile phones, and
desktops that connect to the cloud.

110
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,760
As did, can, these can
be common attack factors.

111
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,680
Each of these layers play a critical
role in providing comprehensive

112
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,830
protection for data as it moves
through the cloud infrastructure.

113
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,840
Ensuring a resilient
and secure environment.

114
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,440
Let's now dive deeper into the network
security layer, which forms the

115
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,950
foundation of this multi layered approach.

116
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,110
The network security layer is the
foundation of any multi layered

117
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,530
security strategy in the cloud.

118
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:21,395
This layer focuses on protecting the
perimeter of the cloud environment

119
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:24,325
preventing unauthorized access
and safeguarding sensitive data

120
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,425
as it moves across the network.

121
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:31,365
Key components of the network safety layer
include firewalls, intrusion detection

122
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:35,435
systems, intrusion prevention systems,
and distribution, distributed denial of

123
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:38,075
access, uh, denial of service protection.

124
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:43,495
These tools work together to monitor
network traffic, detect and block

125
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:46,695
suspicious activity, and ensure the
availability of cloud based services.

126
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,000
We'll start by discussing firewalls
and their role in network security.

127
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,090
Firewalls are a crucial component
of the network security layer,

128
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,210
acting as a barrier between
trusted and untrusted networks.

129
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,410
These security devices control inbound
and outbound network traffic based

130
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,610
on predefined rules, allowing only
authorized traffic to pass through.

131
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,200
In the context of cloud computing,
firewalls can be configured to

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,610
protect virtual networks and
control access to cloud resources.

133
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:21,335
For By carefully defining and implementing
firewall rules, organizations can

134
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,775
prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
data and cloud based infrastructure.

135
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:30,805
Firewalls play a vital role in
creating a secure perimeter around

136
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:34,055
the cloud environment, ensuring
that only legitimate traffic is

137
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,635
able to enter or exit the system.

138
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,595
This helps to mitigate a wide
range of threats, from network

139
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,105
based attacks to data breaches.

140
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:46,065
Next, let's see how next
generation firewalls enhance

141
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,855
traditional firewall capabilities.

142
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,365
Next generation firewalls take
the capabilities of traditional

143
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,439
firewalls to the next level.

144
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,570
They provide deep packet inspection,
application awareness, advanced

145
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,250
threat detection features, offering
more granular control, and enhanced

146
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,870
protection against evolving threats.

147
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,620
The effective implementation of firewalls,
whether traditional or next generation,

148
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,390
is a critical foundation for any
multi layered cloud security strategy.

149
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:19,745
Let's now turn our attention to the
in detection and prevention systems

150
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:21,535
that complement the firewall layer.

151
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:25,575
In inte detection systems and iru
prevention systems are essentially

152
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:29,345
component essential components of the
network security layer in cloud, and

153
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:34,275
manage these systems work together to
continuously monitor network traffic for

154
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:37,515
signs of suspicious activity and take
immediate actions to mitigate threats.

155
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:44,195
IDS solutions analyze network traffic
patterns that detect deviation from

156
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:48,705
normal behavior, which could indicate
the presence of malicious activity.

157
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:54,945
When an IDS identifies a potential
threat, it generates an alert,

158
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:58,070
allowing security teams to
investigate and respond accordingly.

159
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,180
IPS systems take the next step
by actively intervening to block

160
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,030
or prevent detected threats.

161
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,990
These systems can automatically
take actions such as dropping or

162
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,510
rerouting malicious traffic to stop
the attack from causing further damage.

163
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,870
The combination of IDS and IPS
provides a robust defense against

164
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,670
a wide range of network based
threats, including unauthorized

165
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,770
access attempts, malware propagation,
and denial of service attacks.

166
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:33,907
By continuously monitoring and
responding to threats in real time,

167
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:38,355
these systems play a crucial role
in protecting the cloud environment.

168
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:44,085
Alongside firewalls and other network
security measures, IDS and IPS

169
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:48,155
solutions form a layered defense that
helps organizations detect, prevent,

170
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:52,465
and mitigate security incidents,
ensuring the overall resilience

171

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,270
and stay ahead of evolving threats
in the dynamic cloud environments.

342
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,910
To illustrate the practical
applications of these concepts,

343
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:29,010
let's examine a few case studies that
showcase how leading organizations

344
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:29,950
have approached cloud security.

345
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,600
Let's talk about Netflix.

346
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,600
Netflix uses a multilayered
security strategy like employing

347
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,430
custom tools like Security Monkey.

348
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,100
They do that to monitor
cloud environments.

349
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,200
This product approach of theirs, um, like
ensures proper security measures are used.

350
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,130
They use regular security testing
and continuous monitoring, so

351
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,400
that they are always up to date.

352
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:58,705
Automation plays a key role in Netflix's

353
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:00,785
detect and respond to threats faster.

354
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:01,475
Taking

355
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:03,985
Look at another example.

356
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:11,105
So in 2019, Capital One had a data breach,
which resulted in the exposure of personal

357
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:12,715
information of 400 million people.

358
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:17,085
The breach was primarily caused by
a misconfigured firewall and weak

359
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:21,415
access controls, which allowed an
attacker to access sensitive data.

360
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,370
This case highlights the critical
importance of proper configuration

361
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,380
and robust access controls in
cloud security environments.

362
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,130
It underscores the vulnerability
that can arise from seemingly minor

363
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,300
oversights and the catastrophic
consequence they can have.

364
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,820
Now let's transition to discussing
the importance of ongoing security

365
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,050
measures and best practices that can
be derived from these case studies.

366
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:49,215
