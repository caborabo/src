00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:35,944
that enable NLP to work.

25
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:41,464
To function effectively, explore some
core techniques that make NLP work.

26
00:01:42,024 --> 00:01:47,224
The first is sentiment analysis, which
involves detecting the emotional tone

27
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:51,894
behind a piece of text to classify
it as positive, negative, or neutral.

Next, we have language generation.

31
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:05,124
This technique enables computers
to produce human like text.

32
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:12,164
Advanced models such as GPT 3, GPT 4 are
capable of generating responses that are

33
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:16,454
contextually relevant and making them
useful for applications like chatbots.

34
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:19,924
content creation, and
even creative writing.

35
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:26,964
Lastly, name entity recognition,
or NER, identifies and categorizes

36
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:32,014
specific entities such as names,
locations, and dates within a text.

37
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:36,884
This technique is essential for
tasks like information extraction and

40
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:43,534
with the sentiment analysis.

41
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:49,519
Sentiment analysis is also known
as opinion mining, determines the

42
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,499
emotional tone behind a piece of text.

43
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,389
The process typically starts with
text preprocessing where the data

44
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,399
is cleaned and then standardized.

45
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,779
Next, features are extracted to identify
the key linguistic traits following by

46
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:08,919
classification using machine learning
or deep learning models such as BERT.

47
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,259
This method helps companies understand
customer sentiment in previews,

48
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,129
social media posts, and surveys.

49
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,409
It's a valuable tool for businesses

Named entity recognition or NER focuses on
identifying entities within a text such as

64
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,179
people, places, organizations, and dates.

65
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,999
NER can be implemented using
rule based approaches, machine

66
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:29,459
learning models, or deep learning
techniques linked by LSTM networks.

67
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:35,299
It's a powerful tool for automating
the task, such as extracting relevant

68
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:39,689
information from large data sets or
