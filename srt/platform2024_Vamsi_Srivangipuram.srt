1
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:14,840
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,729
before I begin, I want to thank
Mark and the con 42 team for

3
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:19,899
providing this opportunity.

4
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,180
More importantly, thank you everyone
watching the conference live.

5
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,995
Or the recording time is valuable,
and you have so many options

6
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:27,885
what to do with your time.

7
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:30,625
But you choose this
opportunity to learn with me.

8
00:00:30,955 --> 00:00:31,585
So thank you.

9
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:32,995
And let's start the presentation.

10
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:37,714
Okay, the topic of my presentation
is optimizing offer management

11
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:41,564
through enterprise application
integration, also known as E.

12
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:41,674
A.

13
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:41,875
I.

14
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:45,985
But before we dive into the topic,
I just want to introduce myself.

15
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:50,324
Want you guys to know my,
what my background is.

16
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:55,154
My name is Vamsi and I have about 18
years of experience in solution design,

17
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:57,525
business analysis, and product management.

18
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:01,364
I do have a postgraduate
degree in business management,

19
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:03,574
specializing in IT and marketing.

20
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:07,025
Interestingly, I also have a
bachelor's degree in technology and

21
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:10,385
electrical engineering, and it's from
one of the top colleges in India.

22
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:14,664
The last 10 years of my experience
though has been at DirecTV.

23
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:16,905
It's a satellite and
streaming services provider.

24
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:22,615
At DirecTV, I drive solutioning in
the offers and decisioning space.

25
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:26,770
I should say I'm fortunate that
at DirecTV, I had the opportunity

26
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,700
to live through the change and,
maybe we can even call it paradigm

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,109
shift off how customers viewed
content on their televisions, right?

28
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:37,050
So earlier, where it was beamed
in via satellite through the dish

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,289
to now, customers view content
on streaming over the top.

30
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:43,989
So that's another area of great
interest for me, but perhaps

31
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:45,049
a topic for another day.

32
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,359
Now to wrap up, I've also previously
worked as a software developer

33
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,109
building order management software.

34
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:55,564
And I've also done sales for cloud
solutions, including infrastructure as

35
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,214
a service and software as a service.

36
00:01:57,774 --> 00:01:59,414
So let's jump in now.

37
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,674
So here's how we're going to go today.

38
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:04,204
The agenda.

39
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:08,954
First, we will look at when do businesses
need to focus on offer management and

40
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:10,264
what do they have to do to get there?

41
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:14,054
And then what's the need or what's the
business imperative for integration?

42
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:17,634
Then I'll introduce what
enterprise application

43
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,194
integration is, also known as EAI.

44
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:24,234
We'll talk about some types
of application integration.

45
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:27,904
And then I'm going to cover some
best practices and methodologies

46
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,394
that can be used to implement E.

47
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:29,504
A.

48
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,424
I and my favorite part
of the presentation.

49
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:33,114
The case studies.

50
00:02:33,394 --> 00:02:36,764
I wanted to share some case studies
that I came across of companies

51
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:38,834
that have successfully implemented.

52
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:40,724
So we'll talk about those.

53
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:44,714
And then, if businesses do want to
go down the road of implementing,

54
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:49,104
I want to highlight what the
implementation road map will look like.

55
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:53,044
And, we'll talk about what the
benefits that businesses can reap

56
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:54,864
out of doing such an implementation.

57
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:58,624
Finally, we'll tie everything
together with, offer management

58
00:02:58,634 --> 00:02:59,574
and then we'll conclude.

59
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:02,024
So let's jump in.

60
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:06,754
Okay, so when do businesses need
to optimize offer management?

61
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:09,994
so imagine this scenario, imagine
a new business that just started.

62
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:13,614
in the initial stages, it needs
only a few internal software,

63
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:16,694
say an accounting program, a CRM
and an email automation tool.

64
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,564
Now, let's say the marketing team comes
to the sales team and says, Hey, we want

65
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:22,334
to launch this email marketing campaign.

66
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:24,254
Can we get a list of prospects, right?

67
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:28,274
So the smaller business will have
these smaller systems and maybe

68
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,254
they're from different vendors.

69
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:31,084
And so there is no integration
between each other.

70
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:34,664
So someone from the marketing team
will have to go in person and, talk

71
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:38,264
to someone from the sales team and ask
them to pull this list of prospects.

72
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:42,024
That person will then have to go
into the CRM and pull this list and

73
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:43,284
send it to the request and so on.

74
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:46,694
So It takes a lot of transactions
or iterations for the marketing

75
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,794
team to be able to get the data.

76
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:50,774
And then generate the email campaign.

77
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:53,474
So that's how they run their businesses.

78
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:57,294
And perhaps it's okay at a smaller scale,
but what happens when these businesses

79
00:03:57,324 --> 00:04:02,624
grow, and customers increasingly have
high expectations of personalized offers.

80
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,929
And there is a need for customers
to relate to the brand and they want

81
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,209
to have this consistent, seamless
experience across different channels

82
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,219
through which they interact with,
with the business, whether they're

83
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,559
going on to the website or to the app
or, they're walking into the storage.

84
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:19,789
that business has a retail store, so they
want to drive this interconnected business

85
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:21,589
experience across various channels.

86
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,379
the businesses, they want to make
sure these customers come back.

87
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:25,749
They want them to be loyal.

88
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,899
They want them to make repeat purchases.

89
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:28,039
Okay.

90
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:30,894
And they want to increase
the overall customer value.

91
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,774
And this has been proven by studies.

92
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:36,164
There are research papers that
have proved that, 91 percent

93
00:04:36,164 --> 00:04:40,134
of consumers prefer brands that
recognize and provide relevant offers.

94
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:43,844
this, ties into the desire of
customers wanting, personalized offers.

95
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:46,584
Now, how do companies scale, right?

96
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:50,114
So in order for companies to scale, they
must start implementing more systems.

97
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:52,814
they add HR software, a
content management system.

98
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:56,344
Maybe some billing and payment
solutions and, some marketing automation

99
00:04:56,364 --> 00:05:00,394
tool, data analytics, supply chain
inventory, instant messaging, and

100
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:02,994
the list can, it can go on now.

101
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:07,704
All of these systems grow within a
business as it scales and any business

102
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:12,484
that experience this level of scaling
needs a way to connect and rearrange

103
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:18,054
applications so that the data is shared
and businesses can provide value out of

104
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:19,854
connecting all of these applications.

105
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,469
And on, customer loyalty, customer
loyalty isn't just granted.

106
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:24,589
It must be earned.

107
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:28,049
And that is where enterprise
application integration comes in.

108
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:32,489
It helps provide that
integration between these apps.

109
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,059
Now, why does it matter?

110
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,389
Why is integration needed?

111
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:39,769
What is the business imperative
for integration again?

112
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:42,299
Imagine the situation where
the marketing team wants to

113
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,789
launch a campaign based on it.

114
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,839
previous purchase history for customers.

115
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,289
So imagine marketing team having access
to that kind of purchase history.

116
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,679
Or let's say they want to launch
an email giveaway of a product

117
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:55,679
and they have real time access
to the inventory of the product.

118
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:59,969
all of this helps having that kind
of consistent view of whether it's

119
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,769
customer data or company product data,
supply chain data, having that kind

120
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:07,479
of view for marketeers, it really
helps in making their decisions.

121
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,009
making their campaigns alive and
then, the ideas flow through, instead

122
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:15,629
if there is no such integration,
all of these systems are siloed.

123
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:19,929
So there are specific individuals or
teams that have access to a specific

124
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:24,159
system, but all of that is leading
to a fragmented experience because

125
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:28,049
the customer data, where the orders
where the customer orders are placed,

126
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:29,299
they're in the order management system.

127
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,019
The payments are in the payment
and invoices and the leads are

128
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:34,989
in this year and the customer
interactions are elsewhere.

129
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:39,089
And so if there are these are siloed,
then there is no value driven out of it.

130
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:42,259
And then the marketing team or the
sales team or the customer service

131
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:46,679
team, they struggle to make sense
with outdated or conflicting data.

132
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:49,039
So that's where you know,
integration would help.

133
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:54,189
Now again, imagine a campaign
has been created, they want

134
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:54,939
to get through approvals.

135
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,219
So typical way would be to go up the chain
and have executives approve the campaign

136
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:04,679
and typically that would require someone
to log into the campaign management system

137
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:08,219
and approve the campaign or, maybe send
them an email and have them respond.

138
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:11,949
Do an email with approval, but how
would, if the integration is built

139
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,349
straight into the instant messaging?

140
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:20,399
So as soon as campaign is created,
the, the messages go into, the, to,

141
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,429
to instant messaging, and then it
goes out to the executives, Through

142
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,139
I am at seeking their approval.

143
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,459
So for them, it's a one click experience
for the executives, and it makes it much

144
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:36,089
faster to go through the bottom line
again, being that, process of integration.

145
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:38,969
It helps remove these bottlenecks
and in several of these

146
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,899
business processes as well.

147
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:45,834
Now we know a marketeers rely
heavily on analytics, right?

148
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:49,824
So business gather information from
customers at every interactions.

149
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:54,804
Each interaction is a data point and
having that kind of view of data in a

150
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:59,774
single place real time makes the job
of marketeers or analysts that much

151
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:02,024
more easier and much more efficient.

152
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:06,144
So I'll talk more when we discuss
the case study, but each interaction,

153
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:07,274
it doesn't have to be limited.

154
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:09,184
All of these interactions
can be connected.

155
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:13,444
Integrated together into a
single view of all analytics and,

156
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:17,904
integration can make that happen
now from a sales perspective, right?

157
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:19,384
I've told you I've done sales before.

158
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:23,064
So I know how hard it is
for me as a salesperson.

159
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:25,724
When we call it the prospect to
realize that they've already made a

160
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:28,694
purchase, And that happened probably
because the lead didn't flow through

161
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:30,754
to me in time, as a salesperson.

162
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:35,664
So having, again, that kind of interaction
from the CRM to the sales team, it helps

163
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:38,144
nurture leads quickly in a timely manner.

164
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:42,094
And if leads, they're not
nurtured on time, then we know

165
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:43,734
conversion rates take a hit.

166
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:49,804
Now, I also want to talk more about
personalization for marketeers

167
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:51,334
to be able to do personalization.

168
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,569
If there is no integration, they have
to rely on manual segmentation and

169
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:59,879
often what happens is that manual
segmentation, it's not real time.

170
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,779
So data gets outdated fast.

171
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:05,579
So by the time the campaign is
launched, the segmentation has changed,

172
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:08,999
or the customer has moved and so
on, So again, having that kind of

173
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:13,909
real time access to data will help
marketeers react to changes real time.

174
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:17,259
And, provide effective personalized
offers to the customer.

175
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:21,589
So there are studies again, that say
if there is poor integration, there's a

176
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:24,689
loss of about 20 to 30 percent revenue.

177
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,139
And, so all of this is where,
enterprise application integration,

178
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,169
comes into picture and it helps.

179
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:35,759
So now, let's talk a bit about that.

180
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,709
what is EAI?

181
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:40,179
what's the definition of
enterprise application integration?

182
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:44,539
the definition is that it refers to the
seamless connection and coordination

183
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:46,069
of various software applications.

184
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:50,249
But the way I see it is, it
addresses lack of communication.

185
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:53,749
So if you look at the diagram here,
there are several applications, right?

186
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:58,449
There's a CRM, there's a supply
chain management, there is a ERP, the

187
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:59,719
catalog, there is several applications.

188
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:04,229
So how do all of these tie together
and how does the data flow through

189
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:05,419
for business to make sense?

190
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:07,724
And that's where EAI comes in.

191
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:11,834
What it does is it enables real time
data exchange between these systems.

192
00:10:12,374 --> 00:10:14,004
And breaking down the silos.

193
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:16,254
So they're no longer
individual systems alone.

194
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:21,044
You know that the data in a meaningful
way is transferred and translated across

195
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:25,074
all these different systems and available
for business users to make decisions.

196
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:28,544
So again, the data is being
replicated, but it's not really.

197
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:30,989
Duplicate it in that
it resides everywhere.

198
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:34,719
the data flow is real time and
more importantly, though, it

199
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:38,559
facilitates that kind of agility
in responding to market changes.

200
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,129
So the moment business needs to react to
market change, the data is already there

201
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:46,719
and they're able to make reactive decision
instead of having to fetch data from

202
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:49,689
a different system and then go through
an analysis and then make that change.

203
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:54,779
okay, now there are a couple of different
types of integration that can happen.

204
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,119
I just want to briefly touch on that.

205
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:04,489
I listed them, here, so there is a
presentation integration that primarily

206
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:06,839
deals with, having a UI level integration.

207
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:13,299
So it merges, one or more applications,
but it's more at the UI level, right?

208
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,359
So it, so it's also referred to as
screen scraping in some context.

209
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:20,654
while this method is still employed in
some places, it's considered outdated.

210
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:24,974
The advantage obviously is that
there is a unified user interface.

211
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:27,494
So all of the information
is available in one place.

212
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:30,624
So perhaps, it is appropriate for
smaller applications, but then it

213
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,104
definitely is outdated and there
is not a lot of sophistication.

214
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:38,244
So it cannot be a comprehensive
integration and a lot of customization

215
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:44,259
might have to be, built in, the second
type of application integration It's

216
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,419
called the business process integration.

217
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:47,549
Now, let's take an example.

218
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,449
The CRM system, right?

219
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:51,269
It has the information about invoices.

220
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:55,109
And if it is integrated directly with
the order management system, as soon

221
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:58,469
as the order is placed in the order
management, the order data flows through

222
00:11:58,469 --> 00:11:59,809
and the invoice is generated, right?

223
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:00,849
or think of another scenario.

224
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,729
Think of, let's say, as soon
as an order is placed, it's

225
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:04,989
connected to the scheduling system.

226
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:09,684
So if, something requires a technician to
go and install something, Then that data

227
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:12,814
that flows through scheduling system and
the scheduling also happens seamlessly

228
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:14,734
at the same time, an order is placed.

229
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:19,444
So the advantage clearly with business
process integration is that it enhances,

230
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:21,364
and improves efficiency, right?

231
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:23,624
Like I said, the installation
example, as soon as the order

232
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:27,074
is placed, the installation is
scheduled or the order info is sent

233
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:28,704
to the warehouse for fulfillment.

234
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:34,044
Now, all of these happens due to the,
the kind of business process integration.

235
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:39,974
So when that happens, it helps Automate
routine task and teams can, concentrate

236
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:42,394
on, more high value tasks, right?

237
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,674
So there are some challenges with
business process integration.

238
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:49,684
Anytime we are integrating
two systems, there are those

239
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:54,364
integration touch points, that is
a potential security vulnerability.

240
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:58,094
But of course, it can be taken care
by using, appropriate methodologies.

241
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:02,199
Also, it can have a system wide
impact in case of one system failure.

242
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:03,259
So there is that.

243
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:05,929
for example, if the order management
system fails, all of the other

244
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,849
systems that rely on data from
this, cannot function, right?

245
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,349
So it's like a single point failure.

246
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:14,579
But again, a smart, thought out
architecture can address such pitfalls.

247
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:19,089
So now the other type of, integration,
it's called the data integration.

248
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:23,874
This is where the data is transformed
in a way that systems Then at the data

249
00:13:23,884 --> 00:13:27,934
generated in one system can be understood
and interpreted by other systems.

250
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:31,954
So the advantage there being that
it enhances data quality because

251
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:36,194
the data is refined to be able to
be interpreted by other systems.

252
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:38,944
There is also, that improved
collaboration between them and.

253
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:44,839
Also, in terms of analytics, it helps,
having a kind of data consistency and

254
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,589
data quality and overall, it improves
a lot of, efficiency in processes.

255
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:51,319
obviously there are challenges
with it, but mostly has to

256
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:53,439
do deal with data quality.

257
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:56,469
if the data is not maintained
properly, then that lack of quality,

258
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:58,249
rolls from one system into the other.

259
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:58,354
yeah.

260
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:00,534
that's something that can be, avoided.

261
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:04,984
Now, the last kind of, application
integration is, it's called

262
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:07,804
the communication, integration.

263
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:11,594
It's called the communication integration.

264
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:17,314
It's a type of integration where a lot
of middleware technologies, like APIs,

265
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,374
microservices, where the benefits are
that some of the solutions are flexible

266
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:23,704
and can be implemented regardless
of platform where it is deployed.

267
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:25,494
So it may be on cloud
or on premises, right?

268
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:27,774
There is also scalability, right?

269
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:31,124
Not having to replace the whole
thing, but just scale those

270
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:35,794
integrations quickly, Also, it helps
with asynchronous communication.

271
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:39,084
As in the previous example, if one
system fails, it doesn't have to

272
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:42,464
immediately impact other systems,
of course, there are challenges

273
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:44,254
with that in that it's more complex.

274
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:48,594
So we need to take care of how
technologies are utilized, and it may

275
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:53,564
require some, specialized expertise
during implementation and maintenance.

276
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:58,974
So there could be that performance
impact, especially handling large volumes.

277
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:02,354
But again, nothing that cannot
be handled by making some smart

278
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:04,394
choices in terms of scalability.

279
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,834
Now, there are some security risks.

280
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:11,494
Anytime an API is exposed, we need
to make sure that has the appropriate

281
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,924
security functions built in.

282
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:16,414
So that takes care of any vulnerabilities.

283
00:15:17,044 --> 00:15:21,634
Now, okay, now that we learned
about what and what is EAI,

284
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:23,124
let's talk about some of the.

285
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,734
Best practices.

286
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:32,134
So there are a couple of
different, methodologies.

287
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:36,034
I don't want to deep dive into each
of those, but just high level, right?

288
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:37,394
There are a couple of
different methodologies.

289
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,864
So one, it's called the
point to point integration.

290
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:42,724
This is when one application can
just talk to another application

291
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,624
through a one to one integration.

292
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:48,464
This is, of course, not scalable,
because over time it builds up to

293
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:50,124
multiple one to one integration.

294
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:53,139
And Then there's a hub
and spoke model, right?

295
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,089
Where the hub is used to facilitate.

296
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:58,509
data transformation across
different applications, so it's

297
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,959
much faster, but it's also complex.

298
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:06,339
Then, there is the bus integration
methodology where all the participating

299
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:10,159
applications in the bus integrations,
they have common standards.

300
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,179
So that's the way they communicate.

301
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:17,079
Then there's also middleware, which is
some form of application integration.

302
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,119
Where there is some logic that can
be built within the middleware.

303
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,189
So it's abstracted into that middle layer.

304
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,309
So businesses choose to
replace vendors in the future.

305
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,059
they can do so easily.

306
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:33,219
the last one, but I think most
widely used right now in the industry

307
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:36,789
is the microservices integration
and what microservices are.

308
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,974
They use across most enterprises
now, and these are lightweight

309
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:43,774
applications that each service single
functions, and they are lightweight.

310
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:46,484
And due to the fact it and
due to that fact, they can

311
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:47,554
be deployed anywhere, right?

312
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:49,404
So they can be deployed on
the cloud or serverless.

313
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:55,336
So this is a very nimble, very agile,
way, these microservices are very

314
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:59,274
agile and very nimble that they can
be built to achieve, these kind of

315
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:01,354
integrations, between various systems.

316
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:06,059
So these are certain methodologies
that can be used, but Regardless

317
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,879
of the methodology, the best
practice for businesses or

318
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:12,049
organizations implementing E.

319
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
A.

320
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:12,419
I.

321
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,979
Is to have clear objectives in mind.

322
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:18,429
So so they need to make sure
they're aligned on what is the

323
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:20,979
desired, business outcome, right?

324
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:25,099
And also go through this kind
of comprehensive planning

325
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,239
with all stakeholders, right?

326
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,209
Whether it's finance, management.

327
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,699
Legal, IT, marketing,
sales, everyone's right.

328
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:36,679
So now the next thing is, as we are
navigating the complexities of new

329
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:40,779
technologies like AI, internet of
things, blockchain, now businesses

330
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:44,209
need to arrive at some kind of industry
standards so that these are interoperable.

331
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:49,034
So again, Like I was saying, if a business
desires to switch out a vendor, they

332
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,914
should be able to do so without having
to rewrite the whole business logic.

333
00:17:52,914 --> 00:17:56,774
So that is something that
needs to be taken care of.

334
00:17:57,764 --> 00:18:01,674
we already talked about having the data
quality and consistency that so that's

335
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:03,714
an everyday job that people need to do.

336
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:07,584
And definitely businesses, they
need to implement agile practices.

337
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:11,734
For development or for ongoing
optimization, then they're using, E.

338
00:18:11,744 --> 00:18:11,754
A.

339
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:12,014
I.

340
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,014
Okay, so this is a slide
I want to talk about.

341
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:18,654
I came across a couple of
different case studies where

342
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:20,734
companies have implemented E.

343
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:20,844
A.

344
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:21,144
I.

345
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:22,184
Sephora.

346
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,834
I think most of us would know
that it's a retailer of cosmetics

347
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:28,924
and beauty products, but actually
they want to be more than that.

348
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:30,504
they want to build that experience.

349
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:34,554
They want to build a global beauty
community, delivering those in

350
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:37,384
store experiences, building that
connection with the customer.

351
00:18:37,704 --> 00:18:39,114
So that's what they decide to do.

352
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:43,094
But, they were in a situation where
they had these disparate systems,

353
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:47,224
whether it's managing affiliates in
each region, the each country had

354
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:50,204
their own affiliate relationships and
each of them were managed separately.

355
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:52,559
And then there was also the data, right?

356
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,509
Sephora did not know that a
customer making a purchase in the

357
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,449
store that had previously browsed
a certain product on their app.

358
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:02,829
they did not have any of that view and
that's when, Sephora what they did is

359
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:06,809
they implemented EAI, where they brought
together all the customer information.

360
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:10,629
So now, they are able to recognize
the customer, when a customer

361
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,044
walks into the store from, Sephora.

362
00:19:12,374 --> 00:19:17,004
they know that with the app, they're
able to recognize that customer and

363
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:20,454
they're able to provide those proactive
recommendations saying, Hey, perhaps

364
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:22,944
you're interested in these products
and show them relevant reviews.

365
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:25,824
And so they're able to do
that with by implementing.

366
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:29,084
that really helped them with
increasing their conversion rates.

367
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:32,224
Also, talking about affiliates, they
were able to consolidate all the

368
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:33,614
affiliates across different regions.

369
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,689
And, in managing their
relationships in a single place.

370
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:40,739
So that also led to a lot of
cost savings and rise in average.

371
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,929
Order value from these affiliates.

372
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:48,379
so that was a good, implementation Now,
I also know about another company shell,

373
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:54,049
that use this kind of implementation
Shell they have different loyalty programs

374
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:57,124
like v rewards go plus Fuel rewards.

375
00:19:57,174 --> 00:20:01,144
There are different loyalty programs
across different regions, but then, for

376
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:04,764
their pricing analysts to be able to
launch an initiative, they had trouble

377
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:08,854
curating the data from, across these
loyalty programs and make a decision.

378
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:13,609
So Once they implemented EAI, though,
they were able to get to this data.

379
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:17,249
So their pricing analysts were able to
decide, for example, this particular gas

380
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:21,339
station, are they getting more customers
who are just driving along the road?

381
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,864
Or, they're getting customers
who live in the area, right?

382
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:27,954
So that level of data was available
for the pricing analyst so they can

383
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:30,144
make, appropriate pricing decisions.

384
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:33,024
again, these are some really
good success stories where

385
00:20:33,054 --> 00:20:35,414
companies have implemented EAI.

386
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:40,514
And again, there is studies that back
this up, implementing AI businesses

387
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:46,274
have reported 29 percent increase in
open rates for emails and also where

388
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:51,264
this helps is, it's also helps in
reducing acquisition costs, right?

389
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:55,004
because companies are no longer, they're
no longer sending this mass market

390
00:20:55,054 --> 00:21:00,364
emails, they're sending more personalized
emails based on, customer interactions.

391
00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:01,684
and that is made possible.

392
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,169
Due to having this integration
of data across applications.

393
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,239
So, all Okay.

394
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:14,449
Now, I did want to talk about
the implementation roadmap for E.

395
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:14,799
I.

396
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:19,699
it has about four phases planning,
modeling, implementation, and

397
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:20,869
then the maintenance phase.

398
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,254
Planning phase.

399
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:24,294
It's where the applications
are identified.

400
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:26,894
You know what kind of applications
need to be integrated?

401
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:28,994
What is the current infrastructure?

402
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:30,064
What is the scope?

403
00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:31,554
What do we want to achieve?

404
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:35,214
And also select the
appropriate methodology, right?

405
00:21:35,304 --> 00:21:39,074
Then in the modeling phase,
that's where we decide what is

406
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:40,304
the integration architecture?

407
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:43,284
What business processes do
we really want to integrate?

408
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:47,774
And how do we want to map the data so
that it is consistent across systems?

409
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:51,264
So that kind of data modeling
happens in the modeling phase.

410
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:54,684
And, at the end of that, we have a
project plan as well as a blueprint.

411
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:00,979
To be able to do that implementation,
then comes the implementation phase where

412
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,939
businesses are actually implementing
those connectors and adapters,

413
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:08,459
implementing that data transformation,
integrating those processes.

414
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:12,249
And then, of course, testing
it to make sure the desired

415
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:18,109
business outcome is achieved and
then last the maintenance phase.

416
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:22,394
Of course, when it's implemented, it's You
know, being able to monitor and manage.

417
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:27,744
And if there are errors or anything being
able to fix those, that's part of that.

418
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:31,374
Also, for businesses, we all know that
you know that needs have all right.

419
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:35,444
So how do those changes get incorporated
back into the system into AI?

420
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:37,264
that is the maintenance phase.

421
00:22:37,264 --> 00:22:41,934
And, that's also provide support
and troubleshooting for users.

422
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:47,644
Okay, now by implementing E I,
there are, of course, tangible

423
00:22:47,664 --> 00:22:49,544
benefits for businesses.

424
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:52,804
These are quantifiable real benefits.

425
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:56,664
There is increased
customer retention loyalty.

426
00:22:56,694 --> 00:22:57,734
There is revenue growth.

427
00:22:58,994 --> 00:22:59,614
We talked about it.

428
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:01,639
Customers no longer want this generic.

429
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:05,049
Content or generic offering they want
to be able to relate to the business.

430
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:10,269
So businesses are investing in, reaping
benefits of personalized offers in a

431
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:14,909
way that when a customer is presented
an offer and if they accept or

432
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,704
decline it, every action they take.

433
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:20,524
Companies get the data to be able
to suggest the next best, action.

434
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:26,064
and all of these are being made
possible again through EAI having

435
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:27,844
that kind of access to the data.

436
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:31,004
So there is definitely a lot
of cost savings because of

437
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:32,674
the operational efficiency.

438
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:36,294
Nowhere we talked about where one person
doesn't have to go into multiple systems,

439
00:23:36,674 --> 00:23:41,044
but that the data is available across,
in order to make those decisions faster.

440
00:23:41,774 --> 00:23:44,184
we talked about having
reduced acquisition costs.

441
00:23:45,194 --> 00:23:45,614
Yeah.

442
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:48,724
Okay.

443
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:55,204
So now just to reiterate the benefits
that offer management can get by using E.

444
00:23:55,204 --> 00:23:55,574
A.

445
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:55,594
I.

446
00:23:56,024 --> 00:24:00,124
there's personalization, where businesses
track customer behavior and preferences.

447
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:02,504
They can boost engagement.

448
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:05,984
So there are companies that are,
offering interactive features in

449
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:10,414
their apps and gamification and
all of this made possible with E.

450
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:10,534
A.

451
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:10,764
I.

452
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:12,174
Convenience.

453
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:16,034
Of course, customer, if they make an
online purchase and earn some rewards,

454
00:24:16,284 --> 00:24:19,284
they should be able to redeem those
immediately when they walk into a store.

455
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:22,314
So it provides that
convenience to customers.

456
00:24:22,624 --> 00:24:26,784
And again, for marketers, all of these
interactions lead to Valuable data

457
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:30,514
that can, drive insights and further
improve the loyalty program, right?

458
00:24:30,514 --> 00:24:33,304
and earn that customer, loyalty.

459
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:35,174
Okay, I think that's it.

460
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:39,154
I want to leave everyone with this
thought, how, in this competitive market,

461
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:43,454
I strongly believe EAI is a very powerful
framework of tools and processes.

462
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:46,934
Of course, for optimizing customer
management, providing them the

463
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:51,384
right offers, giving them more
personalized offers, deciding

464
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:53,274
what the next best action is.

465
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:57,779
all of these resulting and, driving
business growth, and it becomes important

466
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:02,419
that by integrating data and system across
enterprise, they can deliver this kind

467
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:07,709
of consistent experience and increase
the revenue and earn that, loyalty

468
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:10,889
with that.

469
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:14,289
I think I'm at the end
of my presentation again.

470
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:16,089
Thank you everyone for listening in.

471
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:17,889
I really appreciate each one of you.

472
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:18,899
Thank you.
