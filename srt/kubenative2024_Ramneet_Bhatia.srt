00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,900
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,740
Thanks for joining me today at
the Conf42 Kube Native 2024.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,330
My name is Ramneet and I will be
delivering a talk on leading high

4
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:29,040
impact launches, strategies for
mastering critical engineering rollouts.

5
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:33,809
This talk is based on my learnings
leading major initiatives such

6
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,739
as page sharing at Netflix.

7
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:39,295
I will dive into the roles and
responsibilities of a launch

8
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:43,225
captain and will also share specific
strategies and tactics that you

9
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:47,664
can use to master highly critical
launches in your own organization.

10
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:49,854
So let's get started.

11
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:53,874
Now, what do we mean by
a critical launch here?

12
00:00:54,464 --> 00:00:55,935
Every launch is different.

13
00:00:56,345 --> 00:01:00,015
Some launches require a
lot more rigor than others.

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,940
Such launches typically have some
common characteristics, such as

15
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,750
large scale user and revenue impact.

16
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:11,990
That is, if the launch is going to affect
a large proportion of your customer

17
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,979
base and has high revenue implications.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,919
This would also mean that the
launch could be high visibility.

19
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,449
That is, it is tracked for a long time.

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,910
very closely by the senior leadership,
which makes it even important

21
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:29,220
to ensure clear communication to
seek inputs and share updates.

22
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,869
Such launches may also be a
huge cross functional effort.

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,189
That is, they involve an army of cross
functional teams to come together and

24
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,070
deliver, which brings coordination
as a skill to the forefront.

25
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,010
Now, you may think that this can
be a managed responsibility of

26
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,630
a couple of key stakeholders.

27
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:53,874
But that may not be the right approach
and can result in diffusion of

28
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:59,574
responsibility or something known as
the bystander effect, where people

29
00:01:59,574 --> 00:02:02,974
are less likely to take an action
where there are other people involved.

30
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:09,814
To avoid this, I would highly
encourage you to consider a dedicated

31
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:11,815
role of that of a launch captain.

32
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:17,255
So let's talk about the responsibilities.

33
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:20,605
There are two primary
responsibilities for a captain.

34
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:24,665
One is to ensure launch
readiness and smooth execution.

35
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:28,825
And the other is to be the focal
point of communication for all cross

36
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:30,814
functional partners and leadership.

37
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:37,134
Now you must be thinking who should be
the launch captain in a team that's filled

38
00:02:37,164 --> 00:02:42,254
with engineers, data scientists, design,
and other cross functional team members,

39
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:45,814
who is best equipped to execute this role.

40
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:50,325
At Netflix, we typically have
senior engineers play this role.

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,610
But it can practically be anyone on
the team who's close to the solution,

42
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,140
although there are definitely some
must haves that are helpful in

43
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,110
ensuring your success in this role.

44
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,019
The first is that you should be
clearly able to understand the product

45
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,800
feature, the intended business impact,
and the engineering systems involved.

46
00:03:12,924 --> 00:03:16,944
You should be able to look at the launch
from different perspectives of that of

47
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:22,114
a user, a customer service professional,
an engineer, a data scientist, etc.

48
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:27,015
You should be able to visualize
the launch to identify the expected

49
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:31,214
trends and the not so expected
trends, that is failures and risks.

50
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:36,239
And you should also be a great
collaborator because ultimately

51
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,170
you would have to lead the cross
functional team towards a common

52
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,840
goal of smooth execution and success.

53
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,719
Now let's go a little bit
deeper into the foundation.

54
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,779
The way I see launch captaincy, it
has three support pillars for success.

55
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:55,850
The first is strategy.

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,740
Now a launch captain starts playing
an active role in weeks leading up

57
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:06,550
to the while the entire team is heads
down on delivering the right solution.

58
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:11,505
Making sure it's scalable, testing
the solution, the launch captain is

59
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:15,385
looking further ahead, visualizing
and preparing for the launch.

60
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:21,144
As part of this, the captain drafts
a launch plan that captures details

61
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,224
of how a launch should be executed.

62
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,730
Identifies metrics that will
provide a signal as to how

63
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,980
the launch is progressing.

64
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,110
It is always good to develop a mental
model of what the metrics should look

65
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,510
like in case of a successful launch.

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,390
Identifying potential risks and
mitigations is an important part

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,730
of this role and ensures minimal
surprises on the day of the launch.

68
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,000
The last part is about reviewing
functional and operational readiness.

69
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,750
Now functional readiness means
the solution is as per the product

70
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,260
specifications and there are no blockers.

71
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,709
It is in your best interest as a
launch captain to keep a tab on

72
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,609
the functional readiness and have
regular checkpoints to flag risks.

73
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,570
Last but not the least,
reviewing operational readiness.

74
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:16,490
Operational readiness is important
because in a way it would determine your

75
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,730
effectiveness in navigating the launch.

76
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,070
It ensures that you have the right
metrics and dashboards in place.

77
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:28,585
To assess how the launch is progressing
and relay the status with confidence

78
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:30,965
to a larger group and the leadership.

79
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:37,754
The other two pillars are that of
collaboration and communication.

80
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:42,404
In projects such as these, there will
be a huge cross functional team and

81
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:46,325
you would have to work with all of
them to ensure readiness on all fronts.

82
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:54,085
For example, uh, one of the user facing
features could, where you could expect

83
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:56,185
users to reach out to customer support.

84
00:05:56,955 --> 00:06:01,535
In that case, customer service,
knowledge base articles and FAQs should

85
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:03,725
be updated in time for the launch.

86
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:08,094
And if the launch is sensitive
in nature, you would want to very

87
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:10,235
closely coordinate these actions.

88
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:15,035
This underlines the
importance of collaboration.

89
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:20,034
Under this, you would also need
to identify key stakeholders and

90
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:21,814
their roles to support the launch.

91
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:27,475
Launch captain alone cannot navigate the
entire launch and will always defer to

92
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:32,944
domain and system experts to weigh in,
in case of issues or for validations.

93
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,615
The last pillar is that of communication.

94
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:41,745
As I mentioned, these launches can be
closely tracked by senior leadership.

95
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:46,195
And can have larger implications
on other business outcomes.

96
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:51,974
That is there are high stakes, clear and
timely communication is key in ensuring we

97
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:56,885
cover the risks and keep the group updated
and empowered to help where needed.

98
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:01,764
Launch rooms for such launches
can have many teams and

99
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:03,395
navigating those discussions.

100
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:08,075
while keeping the group focused on the
outcome becomes extremely important.

101
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:15,124
Now, having shared all the context
and responsibilities, this role

102
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:18,984
may seem daunting to some, but in
the next section, I'm going to talk

103
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:23,285
about specific steps you can take
to master each phase of the launch.

104
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:25,725
And we will start with pre launch.

105
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:32,805
So the first thing you can do in the
pre launch phase is run readiness

106
00:07:32,805 --> 00:07:35,075
checks across teams and systems.

107
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,190
This could be a simple asynchronous check
in on Slack or any other collaboration

108
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,790
tool that you use where every team
reports their status to indicate if

109
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,420
they are on track for the launch.

110
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,799
Teams that are not on track should
be asked specific steps that need to

111
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:56,460
be taken or issues that need to be
resolved for them to be back on track.

112
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,140
These blocking issues could be
related to dependencies on other

113
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,010
teams or bandwidth constraints.

114
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:08,595
The intent here is to identify
and surface the risks up front.

115
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:14,535
It also informs and empowers the
larger group and the leadership to help

116
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,684
unblock the launch whenever needed.

117
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:23,174
The second part is reviewing
operational readiness.

118
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:28,605
As I said before, this is important to
ensure you have all the right signals and

119
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:30,835
metrics in place to navigate the launch.

120
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:36,444
Identify key engineering and product
stakeholders who would be the point

121
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:39,854
of contact to indicate the health and
readiness of their respective teams.

122
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:41,755
And domains.

123
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:47,085
These stakeholders will also play a
key role in ensuring that the launch

124
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:52,554
captain has all the required metrics and
signals available to monitor the launch.

125
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:59,084
Collaborate with these people to
identify the relevant metrics, map

126
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:03,685
them to a launch dashboard, and reach
a consensus on the expected trends.

127
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:08,939
The dashboards are important and should
all should answer all the expected

128
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,829
frequently asked questions, such as
how many users signed up, how many

129
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:19,470
users bought an item, depending on
your use case, these launch dashboards

130
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,419
should have a high level view and
troubleshooting views, which to allow

131
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,860
more detailed debugging of issues.

132
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,090
The second part in the pre launch phase
is to review the launch logistics.

133
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:39,190
And the main part of launch
logistics is a launch runbook.

134
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:46,359
Launch runbook is a definitive guide or
source of truth for executing the launch.

135
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,559
All the pre launch preparation and the
work that you would do would get captured

136
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,560
ultimately in this launch runbook.

137
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,160
It includes sequence of steps
needed to execute the launch,

138
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,620
along with all the other details.

139
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,260
I would highly encourage you to document.

140
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:07,359
Everything from little minor
steps to reminders in the runbook.

141
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:09,959
Critical launches get intense.

142
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:13,800
So always assume you will
likely not recall all the minor

143
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,159
details at the right time.

144
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:16,969
Add them to your runbook.

145
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:20,929
We will cover the runbook in
detail in the coming slides.

146
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:31,155
Now, while the launch runbook is primarily
drafted by the launch captain using

147
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:35,384
inputs from other team members, it is
a good practice to review the final

148
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:40,764
runbook with the extended team and ensure
alignment and a shared understanding

149
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:45,464
of the overall sequence, as well as the
individual's roles and responsibilities.

150
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:50,675
The other part is, of launch logistics,
is to plan for the launch day.

151
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:55,114
You should set up calendar invites for
the launch day and for the launch check

152
00:10:55,124 --> 00:11:00,764
ins, clearly marking individuals who are
required, and to be present and share the

153
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:03,454
metrics that they will be responsible for.

154
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,020
So let's talk a little
bit about the runbook.

155
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,959
As we said, this is going to be the
source of truth for managing the launch.

156
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:16,550
And I have created, I've added a little
bit of a snippet to show you what kind

157
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,719
of information can go into a runbook.

158
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,649
So we can capture the overview
of the product or the feature

159
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:23,979
that we are trying to launch.

160
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:28,724
The teams involved, along with the
launch accountability metrics, which is

161
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:30,875
primarily for the operational support.

162
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:35,484
There has to be a pre launch checklist,
which is all the items that need

163
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:37,704
to be executed in a specific order.

164
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:42,685
And these could be items such as
go, no go from all the stakeholders,

165
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,295
configurations that need to be enabled.

166
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,780
systems that need to be pre scaled
and teams that need to be notified

167
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,150
before starting the launch.

168
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:58,240
The runbook then captures a launch day
section, which talks about specific

169
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,119
steps that you need to execute
and also how Uh, validate, how to

170
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:05,800
validate each step during the launch.

171
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,730
All the monitoring dashboards are
captured in the runbook along with

172
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,109
mitigation and rollback scenarios
so that you don't have to do a last

173
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:19,750
minute brainstorming on how to rollback
something that has gone unexpected.

174
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:25,508
There's also a section for post launch,
that is, when in post launch phase, you

175
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:29,774
will have launch check ins to capture
metrics, which would go into the runbook.

176
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:33,595
And also issues that are
under investigations and

177
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,215
tech debts and learnings that
the group would share later.

178
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:41,185
Let's come to the launch day.

179
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:44,624
Now putting all this effort
prior to the launch should ensure

180
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:45,804
that the launch goes smooth.

181
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:50,145
And even if there are unexpected
issues, the team is ready with

182
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:51,935
possible mitigation measures.

183
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,800
On the day of the launch, as a
launch captain, you should use

184
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,140
the runbook to guide the team
for all the launch proceedings.

185
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,020
Lead the launch room with clarity
and empower the group to voice

186
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,350
their concern or opinions while
ensuring the launch stays on track.

187
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:12,789
Now there can be scenarios where
there may be conflicting opinions.

188
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:18,500
Moderate the room to ensure everyone's
voice is heard while ensuring we are on

189
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,710
track to meet the objective for that day.

190
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,320
which could be, for instance, a 20
percent ramp by this particular time.

191
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,520
The launch captain should feel
empowered to hear dissent.

192
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,140
And in case there is no consensus in the
room, you should be the informed captain

193
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:39,610
to decide on the next steps while clearly
articulating the risk and the trade offs.

194
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:44,089
Let's jump to monitoring.

195
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:50,900
Any high impact launch usually has a
staged or a ramp rollout, which means we

196
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,510
start rolling out to a small percentage
of users and then slowly increase this

197
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,390
percentage over a span of hours or days.

198
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,550
In the early stages of the launch,
where there is less traffic, it is

199
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:09,390
always useful to spot check the first
few instances of success or failures to

200
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,800
verify if everything is looking good.

201
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:18,105
It is good to document the success
and failure metrics and also compute

202
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,415
the success and failure percentage.

203
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:26,785
This helps us flag any deviations as the
traffic ramps up since we would expect the

204
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:32,394
success and the failure percentage to stay
somewhat in the same range as we ramp up.

205
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:39,885
It is awesome to see a launch
go smooth without any issues.

206
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,770
But that may not be the
case always or often.

207
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,150
During the launch, each team
will be monitoring their metrics.

208
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,859
A launch captain or any of
the team members can notice an

209
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:55,509
anomaly, which can be an unexpected
trend or a spike in error.

210
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,995
As this is noticed, The launch captain
should identify and call upon specific

211
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:06,125
teams to share their insights on
the potential issue to help assess

212
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,795
two things, severity and impact.

213
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:14,874
The next step then is to summarize the
issue for the extended group and clearly

214
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:20,725
communicate the impact and the severity,
flagging whether this is a launch blocker

215
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:23,275
or something that's critical or a major.

216
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:26,275
If it is a critical or a major issue.

217
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:29,845
Capture it as issues under
investigation on the run book.

218
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:34,075
And you can designate a small subset
of the team to follow up on this.

219
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:39,255
If it is a launch blocker and needs
more thorough investigation, lead a

220
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,285
smaller group into a separate war room.

221
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:45,515
While the investigation is in
progress, keep the group informed

222
00:15:45,874 --> 00:15:50,625
on the updates and help brainstorm
possible resolution mechanisms,

223
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:56,145
concluding the launch day.

224
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:58,805
Now, hoping that the
launch is all successful.

225
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,020
Always conclude the launch day
with a status update and metrics.

226
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,109
Call out potential risks and issues
encountered and the next steps.

227
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,439
It is possible that some teams have
support models, have different support

228
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,500
models in the early phases of the launch.

229
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,050
So always align on the support
models and the point of contacts

230
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,420
for each team in case there is any
issue in the late hours of the day.

231
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:30,785
Last but not the least, the initial
few days of the launch can be taxing.

232
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:34,814
Always include a thank you note
and a reminder for the team to rest

233
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:36,474
and recover for the coming days.

234
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:43,314
Now let's talk about
the post launch phase.

235
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:47,934
As we celebrate the launch and step
into the post launch phase, we should

236
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:49,304
transition from active to active.

237
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:50,834
Active to passive monitoring.

238
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,795
That is, let the automated alerts
take over once the launch is

239
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:59,545
stable and scale down on the
real time or active monitoring.

240
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:04,224
We should also use this time to
shift gears and shift the team's

241
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:08,694
focus towards tuning pageable and
email alerts, which are going to

242
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,365
be the backbone of monitoring.

243
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:16,035
We can also use this time to follow
up on any critical or major issues

244
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,005
that were reported during the launch.

245
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:23,574
It is a good and a healthy practice
to initiate retrospectives, to gather

246
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,805
feedback and learnings for the future.

247
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:30,044
This brings us to the
end of the presentation.

248
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:31,805
Thank you everyone.

249
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:34,035
I hope this was useful for all of you.

250
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:36,365
