1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,730
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:06,470
My name is Anand Kumar, and I'm a
senior cloud engineer at SADA systems.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:13,180
And what I do for my for SADA system was
to help customers in different verticals.

4
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:17,794
to leverage artificial intelligence
and machine learning language in their

5
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:22,924
business and provide solutions based
on, their, their business requirements.

6
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:26,484
one of the industry that
I work is, in retail.

7
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:31,214
during this conference, I'm going to
just talk about, how, machine learning

8
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:36,469
will impact a professional, promotional
strategies in one in the retail industry.

9
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:42,479
So this is all about, the AI powered
coupon personalization for, for

10
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,409
customers, in the retail industry.

11
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:49,774
so the topics that I'm going to
cover is, some introduction about

12
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:55,144
AI, which we all know, and, some
promotional strategies in and around AI.

13
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:59,684
what is AI powered coupon
personalization, types of customers for

14
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:05,344
personalization, how machine learning
algorithms drive personalization,

15
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:11,449
benefits of AI personalization, coupon
personalization, some case studies,

16
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:15,609
some real examples, that I can, I
like to share and some successful

17
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,689
implementation around those case studies.

18
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:23,309
And, and also some challenges and
ethical considerations, when using

19
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:28,929
AI and, ML, and, future trends
in, the AI powered promotions.

20
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,409
let's get into the topics.

21
00:01:33,104 --> 00:01:37,404
First thing, introduction to
AI and promotional, strategies.

22
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:43,204
so to, before I start with, I'm
sure most of you, might, think

23
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:45,274
about discounts, promotions.

24
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:50,089
offers, in the real time,
world, especially in the retail.

25
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:55,409
you go to any retail store to buy
cloths or groceries or anything.

26
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:58,699
the first thing that we
noticed is about the discounts.

27
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,879
when you enter the store, somebody will be
standing outside the door and, welcoming

28
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,729
you with, the promotion newsletter or
paper, 50 percent off, 20 percent off.

29
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,969
so they just wanted to, welcome you
with, their offers and discounts.

30
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:16,869
but do you know that there is
a big strategy that is there?

31
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,669
there could be a business strategy
behind there for every of those, coupons

32
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:24,179
or, the newsletters that you receive.

33
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:28,559
What, the topic is, what the today's
topic that I'm going to do, help

34
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:36,329
you to understand is how this
AI and ML is going to help these

35
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:39,709
retail companies, retail, industry.

36
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:45,849
as well as customer, to take the full
advantage of, of the product or, or

37
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:51,079
the discounts, that, you know, that
the retail, the retail industry sales,

38
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:55,719
the retail shop sales, or, the customer
who's going to purchase, purchase that.

39
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,559
So quickly start with, digital
transformation, in retail.

40
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,639
right now everything is data driven.

41
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:02,834
in AI.

42
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:04,304
Without the data, there was nothing.

43
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:09,625
And, every, every moment, every,
thing that you do in a retail or

44
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:14,365
anywhere, it is all, the business is
all driven by the data, strategies.

45
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:16,615
So what is the AI role?

46
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:21,935
So all these days we are using some
data analytics, but now introducing the

47
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:29,645
AI into the customer's data can help
to give accurate personalization on

48
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:31,269
the offers and resonate the customer.

49
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,070
Individuals, individual consumers,
how that particular offer that,

50
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,120
that, that the retail shop gives, how
that really benefits the customers.

51
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,560
so we all know that, the retail,
the e commerce market or the

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,380
retail industry market is a 6.

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,640
3 trillion dollars, by end of this 2024.

54
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,680
And, how, yeah, AI is going to personalize
those offer, and crucial competitive,

55
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,170
against these retail, companies.

56
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,510
so let's get into the real
topic, from the next slide.

57
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,330
so what is AI powered coupon,
coupon personalization means?

58
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,840
To give you, to start with and give you
an example, say, for example, you're going

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,680
to Walmart or Amazon store or anywhere
in the world, like even in India, there

60
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,230
are big bazaar stores or Reliance stores,
the moment you enter, there might be a

61
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,730
desk or somebody would be standing and,
giving you those, coupons, or offers, or

62
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,830
you might get, some, letters, or you might
get some messages to your phone, email

63
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,720
that, hey, this is a festival offer, it's
Christmas, it's New Year, if you purchase

64
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,590
it can be like 20 percent offer, or if
you buy these two, there is a third one

65
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,910
will be an offer, and today's rate for,
if you buy two shirts, there will be a

66
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,930
pant, it's free, or it can be anything.

67
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:59,575
But most of the time have you
realized that, that those are

68
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:03,865
not even necessary for me at the
time that I wanted to purchase.

69
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:10,155
for example, you might be, say you go to
a retail store, There you wanted to buy

70
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:15,535
a shampoo from a different company and
a conditioner from a different company.

71
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:21,255
Say you wanted a shampoo from
L'Oreal and you wanted conditioner

72
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:24,475
from Aveeno or some other brand.

73
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,795
But, unless otherwise You buy both,
there might be an offer, or if you're

74
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,625
buying separate, there is no offer.

75
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:38,695
and sometimes I don't want a shampoo
at all, or I use something herbal,

76
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:40,935
which I buy online or something.

77
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,045
So you don't need that.

78
00:05:42,565 --> 00:05:47,335
Or, there might be another
example where, I am, I love wine.

79
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:48,545
I wanted to drink wine.

80
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:51,675
Or some other preferences will
be, they don't want to drink

81
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,465
wine or, any alcohol or anything.

82
00:05:54,685 --> 00:06:01,160
But in the paper, it's a very common,
collection of offers will be there.

83
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,140
or say a pineapple.

84
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,070
so some offers would say if you
buy two pineapples, there will be

85
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,080
another one, will be, on offer.

86
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,310
But I don't need pineapple
on for that particular day.

87
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,987
Why would I need, that on a, on a winter
time, pineapples are for summer, but

88
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:24,147
the offers that they give you will be on
winters because the retail store know that

89
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:30,067
we have to give them offer since that has
not been sold or there is an excessive

90
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:32,457
amount of, produce is already there.

91
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:39,947
Most of the time when I go, either I
don't like that offer at that point

92
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:45,177
of time, or I don't, I don't want
it that, that, that particular time.

93
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:53,737
what a, what a PowerCoupon Personalization
does is, every retail store you go, there

94
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:58,057
might be an account, they might ask your
phone number, they might ask you for, the

95
00:06:58,057 --> 00:07:00,577
store, store customer number or something.

96
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:02,017
they always collect the data.

97
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:05,337
and, whenever you enter the
bill, they might ask you,

98
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:06,747
Hey, do you have the barcode?

99
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:08,007
Do you have the, your customer?

100
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:09,737
Do you want her to sign
up for that retail?

101
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:12,917
So everything is all data collected.

102
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:15,227
We collect datas.

103
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:20,677
rather than, So when I say data,
the data is collected from your

104
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:25,617
home number, your house address, or
something that whenever you go, they

105
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:27,027
know that it is you're purchasing.

106
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:33,677
So think about a year worth of data,
what all you have bought from that

107
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:38,357
particular store, shirt, or you bought
it from, from that particular retail,

108
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:43,177
say it is a Walmart for our example,
they store it in, in their database.

109
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,657
So they know this particular customer.

110
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:54,277
is planning to buy, or, he has bought
this many number, of products from us

111
00:07:54,507 --> 00:08:00,787
and every time, or every month, he might
have bought a particular set of, product.

112
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:07,687
Say it is, it can be shampoo or it can
be onions or it can be like, like shaving

113
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:10,497
blades or creams or, or anything that.

114
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:16,547
So what we are doing is, We are
collecting all that particular data

115
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:23,167
for that particular customer throughout
the year, okay, or six months.

116
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:30,497
And we are trying to personalize
a coupon just for him.

117
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:39,907
So rather than a very generalized
discounts and offers, we want that

118
00:08:39,907 --> 00:08:46,227
customer to take leverage on what
he has purchased on his history.

119
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:51,397
Say, again, going back to
the example, I love wine.

120
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:55,942
if I wanted, they know from
my every month I have bought

121
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:57,852
this particular brand of wine.

122
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:03,102
and say, okay, you're buying
that brand of wine, by this

123
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:04,702
time we are giving you an offer.

124
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:08,182
If you buy two bottles of that
wine, there might be another

125
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,942
bottle of wine that is free.

126
00:09:10,312 --> 00:09:14,242
Or, think about another
set of brand of wine.

127
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:20,432
So if you buy that brand of
wine, you might get an offer

128
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,822
from this brand or another brand.

129
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:28,812
you can just, personalizing or trying
to understand the customer's behavior,

130
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:35,082
based on what he has purchased all through
these years and giving an offer would

131
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:40,282
be more valuable for the customer and
for the, and for the retail store to,

132
00:09:40,572 --> 00:09:43,052
hold that customer for a longer time.

133
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,292
I bet that made, that
really makes sense, right?

134
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:51,882
how I achieve this is, we have to
definitely make sure the customer is

135
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,582
a member of that particular store.

136
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:57,662
Say, if it is a Walmart, I become
a Walmart member, and, I just make

137
00:09:57,662 --> 00:10:02,732
sure I collect the reasonable data,
from different sources, from, apps

138
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:06,362
that the customer use, that the,
then the, the website the customer

139
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:11,807
has used, or, or his location,
just based on different parameters.

140
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:16,957
we, we use, machine learning
languages and models, to predict

141
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:20,217
what would customer might buy.

142
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:22,927
how can I just, be a value add?

143
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:28,447
say for example, most of the customers,
like if you, if you see the trend, if

144
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:34,357
I go and buy a wine from a store, I
have the tendency to buy a chips or a

145
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:38,707
chicken, uh, it really makes sense, right?

146
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:45,637
Hey, you buy a wine, so you get
an offer for your Lays chips or

147
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:51,907
something else or you know, there is
an offer that if you buy a wine then

148
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:57,417
there is a there's some discounts on
the chicken or some party product.

149
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:02,487
So you think about your product
personalizing your discounts only

150
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:06,747
for that particular customer and that
discount might not be available for,

151
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:10,297
the other customers, people are spending
thousands and thousands of money on

152
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:15,062
the advertisement and, and doing a
personalization would be definitely

153
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:17,472
makes sense for customers, customers.

154
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:18,612
I personally allow it.

155
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:22,192
I'm sure, everybody, if there is
a personalized discount for that

156
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:27,042
particular person, I feel like I am,
more valuable for that particular store.

157
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:29,612
And I love to go, to
that particular store.

158
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:34,682
okay, moving on, how I achieve this,
how do I know the customer's bad.

159
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:39,887
So there are various things as I mentioned
before, purchase history, six months,

160
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:44,512
a year, or the frequency, I would, I
would definitely allow to collect at

161
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:49,272
least three years of data, his age,
his gender, because, I don't want it to

162
00:11:49,272 --> 00:11:54,462
give a wine to a less, an 18 year or,
or a teenager who's not turned 18 or 21.

163
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:58,642
And based on the browsing history
that he might have used, hey, is

164
00:11:58,642 --> 00:12:00,302
this product available in Walmart?

165
00:12:00,332 --> 00:12:06,652
I just collect that I know, and very
contextual, data, sometimes it is

166
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:08,862
mostly like that particular location.

167
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,122
I live in that location.

168
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:14,722
I have three walmarts around, around
my area within around 10 million years.

169
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,572
I usually go to any one of them.

170
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:20,592
You trying to understand your customers
better, that really makes sense.

171
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:23,902
And, think about some social
media activities as well.

172
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:28,272
because right now, when you hit enter
on any of the website, you go to a

173
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:32,172
particular website, that person really
knows that what he's, is he doing.

174
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:35,452
Say if I go to Walmart website
and I'm just searching it.

175
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:40,572
don't think that I, only I know,
Probably walmart also knows that I am I'm

176
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:48,582
searching for this particular product or
And also they would also know that How

177
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:52,332
many times I have clicked this website
what all the pages that I have visited?

178
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:56,442
So this is all is the
data collection event.

179
00:12:56,472 --> 00:13:01,122
this is this is all getting into into
a database where where it is just

180
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:06,767
trying to get into a meaningful so
You so try to understand, what is that

181
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,137
particular customer's personalization?

182
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:16,507
What is this personality basically, Say
for example, if I am 50 years old or 60

183
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:23,047
years old and a person, if I am diabetic,
say I'm searching for diabetic or

184
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:30,017
anything, probably I won't, I won't need
a discount on a chocolate or, or a cake.

185
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:34,277
Say if an offer comes to me saying,
you buy two cakes, there is a third

186
00:13:34,277 --> 00:13:38,857
one, why would I buy a cake where I
am already suffering from diabetics?

187
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:42,127
And I might ignore that, right?

188
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:43,847
Ignore that particular discount.

189
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:48,267
I might buy for another one, that is
a chance, but the chances of that is

190
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:51,737
pretty less than me having that, right?

191
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:52,827
I hope you get it.

192
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:56,927
basically trying to know their
age, gender, particular location.

193
00:13:57,187 --> 00:14:02,642
This all just derives me or just puts
me into that particular, category or

194
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:08,992
a box where, okay, understand that
particular person's behavior, personality

195
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:12,462
on what he's, he may or may not buy.

196
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:17,042
And based on that, produce that,
give him that personalized offer.

197
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:17,412
Okay.

198
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:19,092
I hope you, you're getting it.

199
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:20,472
And, it's pretty interesting.

200
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:21,702
Okay.

201
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,022
Then comes the technical part of it.

202
00:14:25,802 --> 00:14:26,992
How do I achieve this?

203
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:32,542
Okay, say, I have, I went to Walmart, I
signed up there for their membership or

204
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:37,382
I'm just taking Walmart as an example,
but really I have personally done this

205
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:42,657
project for a different retail, retail
store, and it's been an amazing success.

206
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:47,807
in future you might see this trends
going on with the most of the

207
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,517
retail stores throughout the world.

208
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:54,317
okay, let's talk, get in, get deeper
into the machine learning algorithms.

209
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:58,517
so these algorithms, these are some
of the algorithms that can derive you.

210
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,267
One is collaborative filtering.

211
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:04,557
you're collecting from, different,
users, different patterns.

212
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:12,262
Say, for example, if a person of,
of an age, age between 20 to 30, you

213
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:16,602
particularly know by now that what
his, what will be his eating patterns

214
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:20,722
will be, what he would love, I know
we all love ice creams, for example,

215
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:30,162
but the amount of ice creams you
consume in your later Between 10 to 25.

216
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:35,032
It will be more but during the period
of time you become older the ice

217
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:39,272
creams You might take a couple of
scoop but in a childhood you might

218
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:43,387
take a so basically you're just
trying to understand the pattern.

219
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:49,597
what it helps you is, okay, if I buy
two boxes of ice cream, this particular

220
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:55,767
customer is a 20 year old, probably he
might go, his parents are just sure.

221
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:57,587
It tells me that he's an ice cream lover.

222
00:15:57,787 --> 00:16:02,657
So let me produce this, these offers
for the age group between, 20 and 30.

223
00:16:03,852 --> 00:16:04,192
Right?

224
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:10,232
So, there will be four algorithms
that easily can help you with this.

225
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:11,862
And one is the collaborative filtering.

226
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:14,672
And the second one is the
content based filtering.

227
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:18,449
Where, the customers are
already interacted with based

228
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:20,019
on what they have, purchased.

229
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:23,914
Okay, then comes to the neural
network where I call the deep

230
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:28,024
learning side of it trying to
understand the pattern and predict

231
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:31,294
his future preferences we all know.

232
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:31,854
you know

233
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:40,234
Say if It is going to be winter
right for example What will be a

234
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:45,744
pattern of products or anything that
a person might buy during the winter?

235
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:51,294
so to just give you an example, it would
be very interesting, where a customer, he

236
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:57,944
always buys some, some pills, say for, for
cold pills, because you have the option,

237
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:03,114
you have the tendency to get sick during
the winter by cough or cold or anything.

238
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:07,434
So whoever purchased that, purchased
that in that particular store.

239
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:09,024
This store opened a pharmacy.

240
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:10,439
this retail store.

241
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:14,249
so think about like, why would
a retail store open a pharmacy?

242
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:17,309
Because the patterns are like
showing like that, right?

243
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:19,444
you buy the, based on the product.

244
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:23,924
one part of the department, you buy
the grocery based on the department,

245
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:27,984
he might have the tendency to, to
buy, the cough or cold, medicines.

246
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,579
so this all comes from the deep learning
analysis, based on your, behavior, right?

247
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:39,324
And again, examples like, if you go
to, right now, even if you go to a

248
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:44,674
retail store, previously, any retail
store is, come into mind, say for

249
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:48,494
Walmart, 10 or 20 years back when I,
10 years back, I was going to Walmart.

250
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:50,204
It was just, groceries.

251
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:53,174
Now, they literally expand
it to the clothing division.

252
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:58,194
Right now I can go and buy my, they
expanded to a pharmacy inside it.

253
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:02,624
Why would you buy, why, there is a
pharmacy like Walgreens and other stores

254
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:07,494
and why would Walmart get into the, but
this is all comes from the Patterns that

255
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,414
the customer have bought from the store.

256
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:12,664
Okay, so it literally means
like you bought something from

257
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,854
the store You become sick.

258
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:17,074
So rather than going to the pharmacy is
right there in the retail store, right?

259
00:18:18,124 --> 00:18:23,164
Then the interesting part is now you can
see that the groceries are there Yeah, the

260
00:18:23,164 --> 00:18:27,639
rest of the things have been accomplished
now you can see The restaurant the small

261
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:29,269
restaurants are inside the walmart.

262
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,579
they think have you ever seen like
you're going to a walmart and you

263
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:37,189
know buying pizza or Subway, you
know because people are tired.

264
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:41,089
They know that they will be hungry by
the time they pre shop so rather than

265
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:44,539
just taking their car or just going
out to subway somewhere Why don't we

266
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,169
just put the subway that right there?

267
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:53,519
see this is all comes from these kind of
patterns four algorithms we have used.

268
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,079
One is a deep learning and the last one
would be the natural language processing.

269
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:01,559
This analyzes the textual data,
reviews the feedbacks, understand the

270
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,189
customer's sentiments and preferences.

271
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:08,589
So these are the vital thing that we
have used, that I have personally used in

272
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,429
the, in driving a personalized coupons.

273
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:14,699
okay, moving on, moving on.

274
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:16,799
Why are we doing all this?

275
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,859
What is the benefits of
this coupon personalization?

276
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:22,029
It is pretty simple, right?

277
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:26,189
As I just informed you, one
is improves the engagement.

278
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:30,349
most of the time, keeping the
customer, engaged is so important.

279
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,309
As I told you, just to give you
an example, why would I have a

280
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:34,519
restaurant in a retail, store?

281
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:40,144
a fast food store in a retail store just
because, like you are having customer

282
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:43,204
engage to buy more things, right?

283
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:46,374
Say if I, I was in, in a store, right?

284
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:51,084
while printing the bill, it was, I
bought some, $50 worth off, products

285
00:19:51,144 --> 00:19:56,344
and it just stays like you are worth
to buy, a pizza for free, a slice of

286
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:58,534
pizza at the food counter, but free.

287
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:04,029
I was literally thinking of after
the store, I have to go and buy

288
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:09,438
food outside to go to a restaurant
Or a fast food and i'm just I

289
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:10,718
don't know how they read my mind.

290
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:14,778
Like I was really hungry It was like 2 p.

291
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:15,378
m in the night.

292
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:19,883
So bye i'm just Okay, I love it, so
it just gives me that personalized

293
00:20:19,923 --> 00:20:22,263
coupon, based on my purchase.

294
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:26,683
you go and have your free pizza because
you bought a 50 worth or a hundred

295
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,893
dollar worth of product, from the retail.

296
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:30,073
So this is wise, right?

297
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:31,873
So have them customers engaged.

298
00:20:32,073 --> 00:20:37,613
The next one is, hyper AI driven,
AI driven personalization can drive

299
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:39,523
significant sales goals for the retail.

300
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:40,978
trust me.

301
00:20:41,468 --> 00:20:43,048
I have just put it as 150.

302
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:47,998
I have we have seen the retail store
making a huge amount of profits,

303
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:53,988
and they can Decide, the based on
the customer like what all that they

304
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:57,688
need to buy, you know What all they
need to because have you ever seen?

305
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:02,098
retail store dumping their products
outside that has become less They

306
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:07,138
know What that particular store or the
people might buy they have understood

307
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:13,878
the customers better say You know most
of the time I have seen The grocery

308
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:16,258
products like potatoes or anything.

309
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:19,148
It's always You know or a pre diff time.

310
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:22,748
It just goes where they just dump it
in the yard But right now they know

311
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:27,188
that okay, this particular store only
needs this much of kilos or pounds

312
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:32,248
of potatoes So they don't over buy so
ready by reducing that they have They

313
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:36,618
have raised the bar like in they have
increased the sales and they have saved

314
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:41,748
And the most important thing that I
wanted to mention here is the customer

315
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:47,368
retention personalized coupons has become
really a built a loyalty, for those

316
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:54,688
customers, say I use target and walmart
most of the time They have their own and

317
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:58,488
differences in pieces, but I use walmart
the more because of that you know if

318
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:03,573
some store is giving me that personalized
coupon, I would love to just go back

319
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:08,083
again and again, because, they know
what I wanted and if I'm just getting

320
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,123
a better price out of that, why not?

321
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:16,503
and it just definitely increased my boost
because based on my purchases, they're

322
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,563
giving me discounts on other things.

323
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:23,153
Say, for example, I told you about a free
food that was, based on my purchases,

324
00:22:23,303 --> 00:22:27,003
I got a slice of pizza that is more.

325
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:28,898
But for me, I, I like it.

326
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:30,358
I was hungry.

327
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:34,288
I know they understood my
preferences and there was a coupon

328
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:36,168
that was just popped in my screen.

329
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:36,818
okay.

330
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:41,338
Based on your purchase, you got a free,
just go and have it, what else you wanted.

331
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:42,738
Okay.

332
00:22:43,198 --> 00:22:45,178
Next thing, cost effective marketing.

333
00:22:45,978 --> 00:22:46,978
this is very important.

334
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:50,018
the demand and supply,
it's very cost effective.

335
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:55,918
Rather than, giving a personalized coupon,
pretty general, which has so many things,

336
00:22:55,948 --> 00:23:00,518
and I don't have time to just sweep all
the coupon pages and see which of the

337
00:23:00,518 --> 00:23:03,228
coupons will fit for me or fit for me.

338
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:06,848
Maybe there might be a coupon that
might fit for me, but not for that time.

339
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:09,378
Pretty simple.

340
00:23:10,948 --> 00:23:12,058
Okay, moving on.

341
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:13,438
moving on to the next slide.

342
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:17,843
Okay, definitely, I cannot just
talk about without any examples.

343
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,103
There are case studies, and,
I have, I have made it as a

344
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:22,993
very general case studies.

345
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:24,113
Many of Amazon.

346
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:25,493
Many of Netflix.

347
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:27,323
I've just stayed at Sephora.

348
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,723
That is a, that's a different,
that's a big retail in U.

349
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:30,943
S.

350
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:33,763
So I will talk about that as well.

351
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:34,813
So one is Amazon.

352
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:35,503
Look at Amazon.

353
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:40,064
why they have been very successful,
right now is just because of, the

354
00:23:40,064 --> 00:23:41,994
recommendations that they, they give.

355
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:46,694
based on your purchases, they have
collected all the data over the years

356
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:51,974
and giving you the right relevant product
and the discount that really makes sense.

357
00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:52,714
And, I don't know.

358
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:56,814
I have been using Amazon for the past
10 years, and I have, and I don't want

359
00:23:56,814 --> 00:24:02,824
to go for another one, even though the
other people have given me more offer

360
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:10,208
or the store like Walmart, but still the
Amazon gives me a little value add than

361
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:13,695
the other stores, especially in the past.

362
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:16,185
On the coupon space.

363
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:17,725
right now in U.

364
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:17,955
S.

365
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:19,205
there's a prime deal going on.

366
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,175
I love Amazon.

367
00:24:20,515 --> 00:24:23,525
After this meeting, all day
I'm in Amazon just because of

368
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,215
these, because of the coupons.

369
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:28,995
though I don't want it to buy because
of the people offering me the best

370
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:30,745
coupons, I just go and buy it.

371
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:31,565
Damn.

372
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,735
Okay, next thing.

373
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:33,345
Netflix.

374
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:35,355
Personalized content recommendation.

375
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:38,505
Okay, I think we talked about
a lot of algorithms, right?

376
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,230
And, Netflix is the pioneer
in using these, algorithms.

377
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,560
Netflix, they were going down, and now
suddenly they just picked up, their shares

378
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,710
went so high just because of, they are
using, definitely they are using these,

379
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,470
they're giving the, they are using, the
recommendations, you know based on the

380
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,840
movies that you watch predictive analysis
and the deep learning and the natural

381
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,960
language processing they understand
that okay This person likes to watch

382
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:10,130
romantic movies or thriller movies,
such as that's something just based on

383
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,330
That particular Larry, how do I do it?

384
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,430
you see it's pretty simple, right?

385
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,830
I have a Netflix account, one
account, but we all as a family

386
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,050
shares, my wife wa watches Romantics.

387
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,190
I watch as Thriller.

388
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,110
My son watches cartoons.

389
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,810
So based on that recommendation
and personalization, you get

390
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,220
into that particular, account.

391
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,810
You see all these priorities.

392
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,720
It just personalized for
those particular, persons.

393
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,580
And again, the last one is a Sephora,
it's a virtual artist apps that

394
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,640
enables customers to buy product
virtually, imagine leading a higher

395
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,910
customer engagement and sales with
users trying 50 looks per session

396
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,810
on average, I definitely you should
use one of those it is it is great.

397
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,880
Okay, moving on to next.

398
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:03,705
Definitely, if there is a technology,
there is definitely, there is, there,

399
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:08,175
there is, there are high chances
there you, you have challenges.

400
00:26:08,395 --> 00:26:09,785
Okay, there's nothing that, again.

401
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:14,795
one of the biggest challenges what
we have, seen, in this industry is

402
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:18,165
whenever you're collecting a large
amount of data, because, you're trying

403
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:19,575
to understand the customer's behavior.

404
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,840
especially I told you, if customer is
sharing an information saying that if

405
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:30,030
I am diabetic or if I have some other
disease, those customers should not be

406
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,580
recommended for a more sugary products.

407
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,015
It's just a basic understanding.

408
00:26:34,015 --> 00:26:36,645
So there, you're personally
collecting those information.

409
00:26:36,755 --> 00:26:39,135
You're trying to understand
okay, this customer.

410
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:43,845
So why would I, have to go and tell
the whole public of the world that I

411
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:46,215
am diabetic or I have this problem?

412
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:49,895
But, you're literally entering
that data in that app, in the

413
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:51,460
re, in the retail store app.

414
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,170
That has to be preserved, right?

415
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,830
So the, so encryptions or anything
that retail store, the data privacy.

416
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:01,880
Because once you hack, security and
hacking, I see many people talking

417
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,860
about security and cybersecurity.

418
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,440
I talk, when I say data privacy, you
know what that means is okay, algorithm

419
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,610
biases, AI models are premature by us.

420
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,280
Resulting in unread treatments
across different democratic groups.

421
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:24,010
Okay, this is so funny that, when I
ask a question, to chat GPD at the same

422
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:29,080
time, I ask, at the same question to GE
Gemini, or, the Google's version of it.

423
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,765
And I use prosperity of, There is
another, there are so many, every,

424
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:35,545
GPT gives me a different answer.

425
00:27:35,815 --> 00:27:37,545
Some of them, it just hurts me.

426
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:42,055
Some of them I feel like, why would
you just put, put the state by a

427
00:27:42,065 --> 00:27:46,405
statement rather that is not right,
so you've got to be very careful

428
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,645
in those using those algorithms.

429
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:57,190
say for example, you, you cannot, say
for example, you, if a kid is being

430
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,180
in the store and a kid, a person
of less than 18, who is a customer.

431
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,885
Uh, you are no willing, you
cannot recommend no matter what.

432
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:08,815
You cannot recommend, an
alcoholic beverages for that kid.

433
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:12,455
though the kid might be
searching, based on okay, or he

434
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:14,315
might be doing that, but, uh.

435
00:28:15,685 --> 00:28:19,725
you're understanding that, okay, this
kid is, he's less than, seven, eighteen

436
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:24,135
years old, so I'm not going to recommend
or give him promotions on an alcoholic.

437
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:25,625
this is a basic, understanding.

438
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:28,875
I'm just giving you a high, very high
level understanding because I don't

439
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,475
want to get into the bias things.

440
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:35,165
I don't want to become, more religious,
and just, just telling, what the bias

441
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:36,745
means and, I don't want to get into it.

442
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:37,085
past.

443
00:28:37,395 --> 00:28:39,805
Algorithmic biases are very common.

444
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:44,415
when we are using, these
algorithms, just make sure, we

445
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:46,565
put a class that we understand.

446
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:50,740
for example, recently, like my, my,
one of my friend is a professor.

447
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,670
pure vegan.

448
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,740
and when he gets an offer for,
for, meat, he gets so offended.

449
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,480
Like, why am I getting these
offers, to buy chicken?

450
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,460
I, though I am, I'm a vegan, right?

451
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,860
So I'm just giving a very high
level bias statement that what that

452
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,171
algorithm predicts, and, and just,
It just gives the results on that.

453
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:13,631
And next is the trust and transparency.

454
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:17,881
customers trust before
they put that information.

455
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:22,051
So customers find overlay
personality offers innovative, right?

456
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:26,661
ensure the transparency, and giving
user control their data is crucial.

457
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:32,281
when you're collecting some information,
just make sure that customer know that you

458
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:34,501
are, you're collecting those, information.

459
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:35,881
I think at least in U.

460
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:36,081
S.

461
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:39,461
there are many companies that
have been questioned by, by the

462
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:43,571
government, saying that, whether
Facebook tracks are, where are you?

463
00:29:43,621 --> 00:29:45,511
what they do, right?

464
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:50,491
So I don't, I'm not getting into more
detail on this, but just in a very high

465
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:57,140
level, How trans, we have, we, as an
AI or whatever we are building for the

466
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,260
customers, we got to be very transparent
with them, with what customers, okay.

467
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,380
Technical recommendments.

468
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,300
Implementing AI is expensive.

469
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,470
AI systems are pretty expensive.

470
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,520
It requires significant inventory.

471
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:14,190
So think about, I just told you about, at
least I need a year or five years worth

472
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,385
of data of what customer has been doing.

473
00:30:16,555 --> 00:30:21,465
Purchased in that particular store over
the years collecting the data, cleaning

474
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:28,485
off that data and make it a valuable, a
truthful or, or a very, meaningful data

475
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:30,985
to the, to the AI and ML is crucial.

476
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:36,625
And it is, it's still, you need a lot
of skills and, time infrastructure cost.

477
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,690
yeah, these are some of the challenges
that I have faced, when, when you're

478
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,210
building machine learning algorithms.

479
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,290
Okay.

480
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,480
Going on to the next, trends and
future, maybe, future, future trends.

481
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:50,218
what are we trying to deal with it?

482
00:30:50,258 --> 00:30:55,198
Okay, so as I told you, this will be
your future in the retail space where

483
00:30:55,498 --> 00:31:01,858
nowhere you will be getting a very broad,
a newspaper or a very broad okay, these

484
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:04,908
are the things that are in the promotional
rather than it will be a personal.

485
00:31:05,148 --> 00:31:09,398
So AI is going to enable the real
time adjustments to promotions.

486
00:31:09,653 --> 00:31:11,993
based on the immediate customer behavior.

487
00:31:12,283 --> 00:31:14,343
I gave you an example for the pizza, okay.

488
00:31:14,553 --> 00:31:16,863
Immediately I bought it for 50, 50.

489
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,853
You just try to understand
my personal behavior.

490
00:31:19,853 --> 00:31:22,953
I, they might know because they
want me to have, have their

491
00:31:22,953 --> 00:31:24,028
lunch or dinner at this time.

492
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:27,388
At that, at the retail, rather
than just going to a restaurant

493
00:31:27,393 --> 00:31:29,808
or a, or, at a fast food place.

494
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,168
So it is gonna be dynamic, right?

495
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:35,318
why does DI dynamic?

496
00:31:35,588 --> 00:31:41,438
Because I bought something and I don't
want a coupon for tomorrow to go, okay, go

497
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:43,358
back to the retail store to have a pizza.

498
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:44,143
Why would I use that?

499
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:49,368
I don't want because I go to two
weeks once you know if my coupon

500
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:53,398
just arrived on that time While I
am just going heading to the store.

501
00:31:53,618 --> 00:31:55,288
How valuable is that thing?

502
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,738
Okay, so it is going to be real
time offers Will be producing

503
00:31:59,748 --> 00:32:01,858
for customers deeper integration.

504
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:06,328
So AI will expand beyond the
promotional strategies Okay, like

505
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:10,593
customer services Automation,
Inventory Management, and Predictive

506
00:32:10,593 --> 00:32:13,043
Analysis for future customer needs.

507
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:14,663
This is very important, right?

508
00:32:14,953 --> 00:32:19,053
So the AI is going to, engage,
will be more, personalized.

509
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:23,793
So say for example, if I am, if I
am, going to Walmart, the app or the

510
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:29,288
AI app is Walmart app, just gives
me a, gives Tells me that, hey, if

511
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:33,688
you're about to, hey, this is Sunday,
I understand, if you're going to

512
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:37,558
Walmart, this is the offers that we are
delivering, just telling that, right?

513
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:42,055
Because I don't want to just go to
their website to understand what the

514
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:46,065
promotions are going on, rather than
AI just telling me, you go to the

515
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:48,115
store, this will be just for today.

516
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:50,925
if you're buying a laptop or
you're buying a phone, there is

517
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,485
an exciting promotion this Sunday.

518
00:32:52,485 --> 00:32:55,885
If you go, you're the one who will
be luckiest to get that offer.

519
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,655
How cool is that, right?

520
00:32:57,995 --> 00:33:00,445
Okay, and, A, augmented shopping.

521
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:05,245
Really, retailers will be offered an
even more interactive shopping experience

522
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:07,065
through AI, like virtual assistants.

523
00:33:07,395 --> 00:33:10,205
Like AR product previews, right?

524
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:12,635
most of the time, okay?

525
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:16,195
you're always in a dilemma
to buy something, right?

526
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:17,995
You go, you pick a laptop.

527
00:33:18,315 --> 00:33:20,705
you always ask the question, whether
this is the right price for me?

528
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:22,585
whether this will be useful for me?

529
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:24,615
what would be the return policy on this?

530
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:28,705
what will, what are people talk
about the reviews about this product?

531
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:33,265
And you got to be just keep searching
for all those, and just to come

532
00:33:33,265 --> 00:33:38,715
to a conclusion rather than think
about you see a product Tip, tip.

533
00:33:38,855 --> 00:33:42,165
These are the results that you
had, have, this many reviews

534
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:44,565
have been given all are like 4.

535
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:45,235
5 and more.

536
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:48,865
And, by geography, this is one
of the best laptops that you

537
00:33:48,865 --> 00:33:50,145
can purchase from the store.

538
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,520
Okay, this has the best RAM.

539
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:58,190
This is the this is a jump it just
pops up in my app or application about

540
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,470
that product, it just really Makes
me a touch point like I don't have

541
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,720
to spend too much time whether to buy
that or not Right and give me what are

542
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,750
the advantages of and disadvantages
of buying the buying that product.

543
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:18,550
Here you go you know I don't have to call
my friends or people who have purchased

544
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:24,260
and just spend my time on a call or on
a To understand about the product rather

545
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:31,735
than it just boom pops up All right
Conclusion, good, this interactive of AI

546
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:35,815
personalization promotion strategies is
transforming the retail industry a big

547
00:34:35,925 --> 00:34:41,685
time, offers businesses the ability to
deliver high category and more relevant

548
00:34:41,685 --> 00:34:43,845
coupons, as I just mentioned this, right?

549
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:49,395
And, I'm just not going to technically,
I'm not going to read about that, but

550
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:53,825
just in a high level, 35 percent raise
in coupon redemination, think about

551
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:58,275
like how many people are redeeming your
coupons nowadays, you know it I don't

552
00:34:58,285 --> 00:35:04,025
think you give Any attention to coupons
or anything or for if there was a sales

553
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:07,925
guy just coming to near to me I'm just
going to walk away from him rather than

554
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:11,295
just Standing with him and just talking
about the sales promotions, right?

555
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:15,990
this is going to help in 35 percent
rise in using the coupons And, we

556
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,860
have found that there's 22 percent
of the customers you will just retain

557
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,690
with that particular store, right?

558
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,430
However, while the potential AI
impersonalization is immense,

559
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,280
businessmen also address the key
challenges that I have mentioned

560
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,690
on data privacy, compliances, there
should be regular guardrails for

561
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,730
all of this, all of this, technology
behind, that works behind the AI.

562
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,770
so somebody is not misusing that rather
than just, it is just going to help

563
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,750
the real man, help the man, mankind.

564
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:49,170
some companies that are developing the
artificial intelligence, models, machine

565
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:54,040
learning models should be more cautious
to be, to understand, okay, this is

566
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,790
sensitive data, I'm not going to screw up
with this, just add, I'm going to add some

567
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,840
extra layer of protection on top of it.

568
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,050
Got it.

569
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,440
I think that's all about,
the today's presentation.

570
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,380
I hope you all might have enjoyed this.

571
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,930
