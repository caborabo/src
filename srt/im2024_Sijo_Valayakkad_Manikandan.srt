1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,310
Welcome to CONF42
Incident Management 2024.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,690
I'm going to talk about data driven
retail, leveraging forecasting

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,649
models to enhance customer experience
and operational efficiency.

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,409
There's a lot of, jargons here, but
on a simple terms, I'm going to talk

5
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:26,219
about how various forecasting models
helps achieve, enhanced customer

6
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,529
experience, in this fast paced world.

7
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:34,889
Before getting into the topics,
I would like to introduce myself.

8
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:38,864
I'm, I'm Sijo Walekadmanikantan.

9
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:43,654
I'm a data scientist with,
over seven years of experience.

10
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:50,184
my specializations have been primarily,
with a huge forecasting, background.

11
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:54,374
and when I talk about forecasting,
it's forecasting at scale, dealing

12
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:59,245
with, millions of time series and,
with a lot of historical data.

13
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:05,215
I'm also, active in the researching
research space, authorship, and

14
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:09,565
as well as mentoring junior data
scientists and analytics professionals.

15
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:14,705
educationally, I have a master of
science from University of Texas at

16
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:19,795
Austin, and a bachelor of engineering
degree, in mechanical engineering.

17
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:26,185
I would like to walk you through
what I'm going to talk today.

18
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:31,975
so, At the very beginning, I'm
going to talk about the need for

19
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:34,855
forecasting, with respect to retail.

20
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:41,285
so first I will go into the nuances
of, high level retail value chain.

21
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:43,985
and then, I will introduce you to the.

22
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,570
Retail landscape and the necessity
of why, why advanced forecasting

23
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,340
models are very careful consideration
of forecasting models need to be,

24
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,610
considered, in the retail space.

25
00:01:57,135 --> 00:02:03,115
in the next section, I will go over
forecasting challenges, specifically

26
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:09,435
regarding, Horizon Green and, the
challenges brought about by COVID 19.

27
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:13,895
I will also touch upon other,
other aspects, other challenges,

28
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:18,495
relating to these, and, and
specific forecasting challenges.

29
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,000
and, and once we understood the value
chain as well as, the forecasting

30
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,900
challenges, I will touch upon on a high
level the three different classes of,

31
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,360
forecasting techniques that's being
used in the industry and that has

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,530
shown, tremendous results, with respect
to performance, accuracy, and so on.

33
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,530
Then I will introduce you to some case
studies, that a couple of case studies on

34
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:56,090
how, certain retailers, global retailers
have managed to, use forecasting to,

35
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,560
to solve their supply chain issues.

36
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,850
and towards the end, I would discuss
where the future of forecasting

37
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,520
is and what are the generic trends
that's being seen in the retail space.

38
00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:15,415
as of as of today and it's a it's a
very very bright future ahead as well

39
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:22,110
as filled with a lot of challenges
So without further ado, i'm gonna get

40
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,430
started, with why do we forecast right?

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,290
So first thing before even
understanding why we need to forecast

42
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,220
why need to make predictions about
anything like it could be sales.

43
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:45,980
It could be demand it could be revenues
or it could be outages and so on

44
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,850
any any You disruptions and so on.

45
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:55,660
we need to understand the complexity
of the retail value chain, right?

46
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:04,150
So retail value chain is on a very,
very, very high level is the chain.

47
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,540
It's the, series of events that
captures the flow of goods from

48
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,400
manufacturers to consumers.

49
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,460
Okay.

50
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,630
So talking about consumers,
we are all consumers.

51
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:25,820
I'm sure everyone is aware of Amazon,
Walmart, Kroger, and so on, right?

52
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,920
these are the multinational corporations.

53
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,470
I'm sure there are other, different sizes.

54
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,830
I mean, retailers come in different
sizes and scales, even, even, a

55
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,270
neighborhood grocery chain will
have its own retail value chain.

56
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,740
So, we cannot, generalize, generalize.

57
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,480
retail value chains, it's it's different.

58
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:55,890
according to the companies and everything
so but typically, we see these components

59
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:02,955
in like ranging from manufacturers to
consumers in in every supply chain, right?

60
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:09,215
And sometimes it could be like a different
order or different configurations, or,

61
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:14,425
or it could be, each component might
be tons, hundreds, might, it may be

62
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:19,055
one, and it might be having a different
sort of networks and so on, right?

63
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:23,465
So in here we have, the
manufacturer, right?

64
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:28,465
So manufacturer is the one
who manufactures goods.

65
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:34,225
if we take, let's say, a Walmart store,
for instance, any, or you can take any

66
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:36,125
grocery store, for instance, right?

67
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:44,255
They have tons of inventory, tons
of stocks, tons of products, right?

68
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:47,465
it's, you know, called
SKUs, stock keeping units.

69
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:51,885
each, each product is identified, each
SKU code and, and, and all other things.

70
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:52,165
Right.

71
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:56,915
So if you walk into a Walmart, any
store, you, you're, you're dealt

72
00:05:56,915 --> 00:06:02,215
with like, I don't know, hundreds and
thousands of products, if not millions.

73
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:02,905
Right.

74
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:07,455
Like, a milk from a particular
brand is, is, is a SKU.

75
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:10,940
And then even if you look within a
category of something like milk, right.

76
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,430
There could be maybe, fifties or
hundreds of hundreds of different SKUs

77
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,390
comes in different sizes, different
shapes, different packaging, and so on.

78
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:22,940
Right.

79
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,530
So these, so if you take a simple
case of, one such product, it's

80
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,850
being manufactured at some facility.

81
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,240
let's say if you take a perishable
goods, generally, like, like milk,

82
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,190
for instance, it comes from the.

83
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:42,955
same country or same vicinity as, as
the places, but it's not guaranteed.

84
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:47,295
Let's say something like a plastic
product or a kitchen product

85
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:50,105
might come from as far as China.

86
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:50,405
Right.

87
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:54,285
So we all know like China is
the biggest manufacturing hub.

88
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:59,525
So a lot of products come from China
and then they need to be transported

89
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,355
to, how does it reach consumers?

90
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:08,690
They must be transported across the
continents to reach the consumers.

91
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:17,470
now the problem is we don't know how
many products a customer want, right?

92
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,550
So that's a problem.

93
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,420
But when you talk about transport, I
would like to go into the transport first.

94
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,250
So transport could be I put an image
of truck here, but it could be ship.

95
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,440
It could be multi modal.

96
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,880
It could be trains It could go
from let's say ship to a train to a

97
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,080
Car and then to a person in a bike
to store and then consumer so it

98
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,290
could be any combinations, right?

99
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,610
So usually the the the manufacturer
the goods move from manufacturers

100
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,040
to distribution centers, right?

101
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,760
distribution centers are warehouses
where all these products are stored

102
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,405
and depending on the You demand from
the stores or consumers, the products

103
00:07:56,405 --> 00:08:00,065
move from distribution centers to
particular stores and then later

104
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:05,105
on consumers but there are several
questions that question marks right

105
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:11,345
like from a manufacturer to distribution
center how many products do we stock

106
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:12,785
up in the distribution center, right?

107
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:16,085
So as we talked about like we
have hundreds and thousands of

108
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:19,995
products and we need to allocate
the space in the distribution

109
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:25,555
center According to according to the
demand because the space is limited.

110
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:26,925
We don't have unlimited space.

111
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:32,215
So we should be able to Understand
how much space is required in the

112
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:38,785
distribution center and then we need to
know You How big of a transport that's

113
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:42,095
required and how frequently the transport
vehicle should go from a distribution

114
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:47,085
center to a store and how many products
should be stocked up in a store, right?

115
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:50,785
Like as a consumer, you don't
want to go into a store and then

116
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:54,435
the store associate telling you
that, Hey, we have the product,

117
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:55,935
but it's in a distribution center.

118
00:08:55,975 --> 00:08:57,245
I'll get it to you in a while.

119
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,500
These days, people expect, deliveries
and products on the same day.

120
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,790
I'm sure like in the U.

121
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,760
S., Amazon has same day deliveries.

122
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Most of the e commerce giants are
trying for same day delivery, two hour

123
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,440
delivery, three hour delivery, and so on.

124
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,210
And in places like India, there's
even 10 minute delivery, right?

125
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,250
So we expect products to arrive.

126
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:21,005
As quick as possible.

127
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:29,845
So for that if we as retailers
need to Anticipate customer

128
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:33,085
demand, and then act accordingly.

129
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:37,185
But the problem comes because when
we, when the products move from

130
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:41,515
manufacturers to consumers, these demands
need to be anticipated in advance.

131
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:47,055
For example, like, we need to know
that, let's say, six months or one

132
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:52,555
year in advance that the customers
might need, in this area might need

133
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:57,630
10, 000 units of a particular jacket
because that's a demand, right?

134
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:04,140
So Anticipation is crucial here
because the same thing if consumers

135
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,460
get happy unhappy They might leave
you for another retailers and and

136
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,280
they will look for products elsewhere.

137
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,230
Then they're not going to wait correct.

138
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,930
So in summary, There are so many
missing questions and missing, variables

139
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,340
that could affect, different pieces.

140
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,090
So, it's, it's, I would say there's
like tons of variables, right?

141
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,910
Like, like even, later I'll
get into the challenges, right?

142
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,410
Like COVID and things like those will
shut down these retail value chain,

143
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,020
which would cause issues, but consumers
still want, products and stuff.

144
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:37,830
Right.

145
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,930
So that's why we need forecasting
and forecasting at several grains,

146
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,590
and several horizons and make
for making, different decisions.

147
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,280
Correct.

148
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,660
So if you look at the landscape,
right, the retail landscape

149
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,919
and forecasting, need.

150
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,300
There is long manufacturing
lead times, right?

151
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,730
Like, imagine that you're coming
up with a new product, there is

152
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,170
a product design that's involved.

153
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,690
And then once the product is designed
and then you send it to the manufacturing

154
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,740
facility, let's say if it's in China,
and then, you enter a contract and

155
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,100
then, the products get manufactured
and then they need to be shipped.

156
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,060
So it takes a long time.

157
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:25,175
So it's, companies probably are, are
probably, you know, discussing about

158
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:28,505
what product might come out, let's say
one year or two years or even three

159
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:30,345
years and four years from now, right?

160
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:33,815
So you need, you need forecasting.

161
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:40,025
And another thing is consumers are
complex, especially, consumers as

162
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:42,255
in, the day to day, uses, right?

163
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:47,655
The retail users, people change, like,
especially in this world, like you're

164
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:53,985
all influenced by, social media trends
and, and advertisements and so on, right?

165
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:58,385
Like a celebrity wearing a
particular, a jacket would shoot up

166
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:00,595
the demand for a particular jacket.

167
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:04,945
But these are, these are, but
these are, unexpected demands.

168
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:09,845
but still like the point is their
behaviors and preferences change

169
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,325
depending on a lot of, lot of, factors.

170
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:13,065
Right.

171
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:19,830
And another thing is with with a lot
of retailers becoming omnichannel, like

172
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:26,100
blending online, in store and hybrid
experiences, it's, it's tougher, right?

173
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,210
Like there are so many retailers
offering order online and pick up in

174
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,770
store and as well as hey, go to the
store and place the order in the store.

175
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,120
So.

176
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:41,265
it's getting complex because, back
in those days, the retailers used

177
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:45,185
to estimate the traffic, a mall
traffic, and like, it was a traffic

178
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:49,825
based, systems and traffic used to
be a great input for the transactions

179
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:51,605
and essentially revenue and sales.

180
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:58,085
But these days that traffic could be,
could lead to no transactions and they

181
00:12:58,135 --> 00:13:01,315
could go into a store and place an
order, or they could go into a store

182
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,125
and then look up their phone and then.

183
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,640
place an order from the phone and then,
then, that would, you know, throw away

184
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,290
the projections of the roof, right?

185
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:16,725
And retailers need a real time inventory
optimization for so and so reasons

186
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:22,145
because things change rapidly and also
right like competition is a big factor.

187
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:28,165
with let's say Amazon for instance are
are running prime day they every every

188
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:33,315
retailer has their own one or two days of
high discount high promotion events and

189
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:39,655
then that would You know, lead to, loss of
sales or maybe like, competition, taking

190
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:41,205
away market share and things like those.

191
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:44,305
So we need better decision
making tools considering the

192
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:46,144
competition in mind as well.

193
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:52,005
So forecasting is, is extremely
critical, because they can

194
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:53,545
act as so many things, right?

195
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:57,175
Like controlling costs, like we don't
want to like, let's say, build up a

196
00:13:57,185 --> 00:14:01,255
lot of inventory in our, warehouse
and take up space where we could,

197
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:06,355
might as well like, Stock up on
profit maximizing products, right?

198
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:10,025
So forecasting is a very, very,
very critical competence for all

199
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:14,705
the retailers for maximizing sales,
maximizing profits, and so on.

200
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:23,980
So now let's look at, forecasting
challenges, like why it's hard and

201
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:29,310
why do we need different, scalable
and ever evolving forecasting systems.

202
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,440
so I'm not going to go into
all the challenges here.

203
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,410
I'm going to touch up on and
give a sense of two main aspects,

204
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,210
with respect to, the forecasting.

205
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:40,970
So

206
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,090
let's say, so I'm going
to look at horizon, right?

207
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,290
So horizon is nothing but, how long
into the future are we looking at?

208
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,580
let's say, if you're talking about,
I don't know, one to two, three

209
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,040
weeks, like what sort of decisions
are the companies making, right?

210
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:07,350
So let's say three weeks, like generally,
generally those decisions are around.

211
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:14,305
Store replenishment, sales and operations,
execution, smooth delivery, distribution

212
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:18,755
center replenishment, inventory
allocation, end of season, clearance,

213
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:21,285
seasonal promotions, and so on, right?

214
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:27,455
So these are very short term decisions
that, that the, store managers and,

215
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:33,555
Location planners or inventory specialist
or supply chain planners make to ensure

216
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:39,745
that, the products get sold, the targets
are met, inventory is sold out and so on.

217
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:46,505
And, and the other one is, is around,
like, let's say, 3 to 12 weeks.

218
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:51,460
That's, we are talking about somewhere
around, 3 weeks to, close to three

219
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,230
months mark a quarter, right?

220
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:59,960
So here the decisions would be mostly
around workforce optimization capacity

221
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,400
management And sales and operation
execution smooth delivery flows

222
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,310
distribution center replenishment
and inventory allocation, right?

223
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,750
so in these even there are a lot
of overlaps because the forecast

224
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,390
generally, gets more and more
accurate, as we go closer, right?

225
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,500
So it's easier to predict whether it
will rain three hours from now or even

226
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,260
tomorrow than one month from now, right?

227
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,500
Because a lot of things are
not in our control and it's

228
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,280
harder to make predictions.

229
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,920
especially when, like, there
are so many things driving the

230
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,650
demand as well as the supply.

231
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,050
And at a three to 24 months mark,
it's then it's a different ball game.

232
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,380
Like we are moving a bit about from day to
day operations to a high level strategic

233
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,330
planning and things like those, right?

234
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,140
So we talk about like, at this
this A quarter out to let's

235
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,630
say to up to a two year mark.

236
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,180
It's mostly about assortment planning like
what sort of assortments do we need to put

237
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:07,060
in a particular store as well as not just
store at a at a company level right let's

238
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:12,420
say I don't know like a Milk company,
let's say they will have not just milk.

239
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,520
They will have dairy
based products, right?

240
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:21,710
So What what should be the optimal
allocation of budget funds to create let's

241
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:27,740
say an assortment of 50 products so that
and as well as the units to like Maximize

242
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,720
profits maximize sale and also meet
the demand of all the consumers, right?

243
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,025
So and space optimizations like
as I talked about before You the

244
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:42,025
retailers have limited space,
at a given point in time, right?

245
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:46,525
So, they need to ensure, ensure
which products get what space.

246
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:52,075
And so they need to, or if there's a
new product development, a new product

247
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:56,585
coming, they need to make sure that they
need a lot of space and, and, and so on.

248
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:57,015
Right.

249
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:57,865
So.

250
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:01,525
And also a long lead
time purchasing, right?

251
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:08,305
So companies usually like enter
contracts with manufacturers and and

252
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:11,155
Shipping partners way in advance.

253
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:16,710
It could be as it could be long time
more than 24 months as well, but like

254
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,900
generally they enter into agreement
based on the price that's that's being

255
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,420
realized based on the future oil prices
based on transportation costs based on

256
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:31,005
manufacturing cost based on product cost
based on material planning and so on

257
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:36,795
right and also like sales and operation
planning Like do we have enough workforce?

258
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:43,345
to to function to to Drive, let's
say store operations or it could

259
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:46,555
be corporate workforce or it
could be planners and so on right?

260
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:51,740
And anything beyond 24 months Or even
up, it could be, depending on the

261
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,000
retailers could be like three years,
but usually most of the retailers,

262
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,710
99 percent of the retailers have
like a, two, two years cycle, with

263
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,530
respect to, long horizon planning.

264
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,610
so, but Anything beyond 24 months,
even that's possible, right?

265
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,930
Like companies are making five year, 10
year or even 20 year, strategic, planning.

266
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,400
So companies still want to know
what happens beyond the scale and

267
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,650
to make strategic decisions on which
directions to go and also to influence

268
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,260
product design and development.

269
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:28,430
product design and development,
decisions as well as to enter into

270
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,450
contractual obligations so that,
the retailers can make profit.

271
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:39,450
Like if you think some materials price
is going to go up by, let's say 50%, it's

272
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,980
better to lock in that contract right
now to get it at a much cheaper price.

273
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,120
So things like those, those are strategic
decisions, that, that could be made.

274
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,405
So every Decision is, is, should be
happening at a very different time.

275
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,295
So that means, let's say there's
something like a demand forecasting

276
00:19:57,295 --> 00:20:01,245
system, and this, based on the use
case, like, based on the teams, for

277
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:04,585
instance, the, all the, use cases that
we are seeing on the screen is handled

278
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,645
by different departments, like, for
instance, product design and development,

279
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:09,145
versus, let's say, assortment planning.

280
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:14,920
These are all different Teams,
so these teams would need inputs

281
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,150
at different points in time.

282
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,700
So let's say, something like one to three
weeks, the teams requiring these short

283
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,640
term forecasts expect a very high level
of accuracy, and they might, require it

284
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,110
at a very, very, very small granularity.

285
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,700
Let's say they would get and download,
okay, this particular SKU of milk,

286
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,770
what is its, I don't know, sales
or demand or, or anything, right?

287
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,650
So there, they track a lot of,
inputs, like could be sales.

288
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,600
It could be transactions.

289
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,850
It could be, even stock outs, right?

290
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,060
Prediction stock outs.

291
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,040
So versus let's say, when we get into
like strategic planning and product

292
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,690
design, it could be on a high level,
like, okay, maybe the grocery chain

293
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,350
or, or even like a dairy, what is it?

294
00:20:58,995 --> 00:21:04,355
This or milk as a whole like, okay, how
many gallons of milk or it could be at

295
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:09,925
a very high level as well Right, so it's
different every forecasting use case is

296
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:13,065
different and sometimes we are forecasting
for the same thing, but depending on

297
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:18,155
the team different, granularities are
required to ensure that the customer

298
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:24,100
experience is elevated, the the Issues
are solved at different, points in time.

299
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,990
So that's, that's, about horizon.

300
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,630
but there are so many other
challenges as well, right?

301
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,730
Like, as I said before, forecasting
at a SKU level or a store or a region

302
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,750
or a channel level, like for instance,
Walmart has both, e commerce store

303
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,000
and they also have physical stores.

304
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,730
And so these are
different, like, so maybe.

305
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,390
for the same product, we
need channel level sales.

306
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,810
It could be, let's say a
region level, forecast.

307
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,630
So these are all, and they
are all interconnected.

308
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,560
They're all hierarchical problems, right?

309
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:02,020
Like, let's say if the, the, any, retailer
has like thousands of stores and then,

310
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,810
Every state has let's say 50 stores
and then the sum of all these store

311
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,610
forecasts must align with the state level
forecast and as well as region level

312
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:17,270
forecast and then Ultimately country
level and then global level, right?

313
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,655
So That's challenging to make
it work, as well as, short

314
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:23,145
term versus long term, right?

315
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:25,235
Like immediate was a strategic decision.

316
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:29,055
So immediate is more around, yes,
we need to add a high granularity

317
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:33,245
and like the accuracy needs to be
precise to make that final step in the

318
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:37,685
process, as perfect as possible because
it, it, it has the highest impact.

319
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:39,745
I'm not saying the other one that
does not have an highest impact,

320
00:22:39,745 --> 00:22:44,690
but still has a very high impact
making, like, some mistakes in, in

321
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,460
that level of the value chain can
cost, a lot for, for the retailers.

322
00:22:50,505 --> 00:22:54,485
And, another thing is, since
retailers operate on both e commerce

323
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:59,475
and the store level, the data can
come from, several sources, right?

324
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:04,935
Like, POS data might come from the POS
systems involved, installed on the stores.

325
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:07,895
And these are physical systems.

326
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:10,945
So there could be issues
with the physical system.

327
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:11,835
That's a different story.

328
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:15,745
Like sometimes the store won't
work, like some PO systems won't

329
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:17,385
work and they might be faulty.

330
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:24,325
Or, so then, then the other case of, yeah,
we have POS systems and then, some people

331
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:26,455
make purchases online with credit cards.

332
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:31,135
Some people use cash So we don't have
information about cash payment, but

333
00:23:31,135 --> 00:23:34,325
if you pay with a credit card you have
you get much more information about

334
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:40,665
the consumers and so on so That's
data fragmentation and then there is

335
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:45,180
an issue of Demand volatility, right?

336
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,320
That's that's a tougher problem to handle.

337
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,880
people people's intentions their purchase
behavior customer behavior changes

338
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:01,160
because of Several reasons we cannot
predict all of them, but we can kind

339
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:07,370
of look at the patterns and and Predict
their behaviors and predict the demand

340
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,875
based on or with some volatility and
variance, of course You on the on the

341
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:17,435
sales demand and other other metrics
that retailers care about right and also

342
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:22,385
There's a big trade off between accuracy
and operational efficiency we can always

343
00:24:22,415 --> 00:24:28,630
work with High complex systems to, create
highly accurate forecast, but sometimes

344
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:34,160
training them generating forecast might
take a huge hit on operational efficiency.

345
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,080
one thing that I want to touch upon
has the impact of COVID 19, not just

346
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,590
with respect to impact of COVID 19.

347
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:48,260
the reason why I brought this
up is because, is to show

348
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,280
that, Such things can happen.

349
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,770
Unexpected things can happen in
the world of, retailers, right?

350
00:24:54,790 --> 00:25:01,900
Like it's, it has been a wake up call
on being resilient on, such events.

351
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:08,480
And for instance, when COVID hit,
the retailers had to make a lot of,

352
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,230
a lot of, store level and like other
changes like safe shopping and six

353
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:19,000
feet distance and mask providing hand
sanitizer offering, touchless payments

354
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,470
and, and so free mask and like, yeah,
ensuring some people, some retailers

355
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:27,270
even like, install temperature control
systems in front of the retailer stores

356
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,360
to ensure safety for their customers.

357
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,830
Right.

358
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,360
And also people started working
from home a lot and they

359
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,750
started staying at home a lot.

360
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,140
So they were shopping Online a lot.

361
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,000
So the consumer behavior changed they
were looking for And the retailers started

362
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,310
facing challenges with respect to some
products might look good on a screen now

363
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:54,310
the products are our product visibility
depend is dependent on how it looks on a

364
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:59,200
particular smartphone or whether people
are shopping on a iPhone versus android

365
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,535
or is it on a laptop or I don't know right
like and also a lot of sharing like if you

366
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:10,315
purchase something online you tend to like
Ask somebody close to you or or you're

367
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:11,885
going to share it with a friend and so on.

368
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:17,875
So Tons of consumer behavior change
happened during, the pandemic,

369
00:26:17,925 --> 00:26:20,715
as well as there was a lot of
supply chain disruptions, right?

370
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:25,995
Like when, in the pandemic started in,
in Wuhan in China, a lot of factories,

371
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:30,905
manufacturing factories were based
out of Wuhan and that caused them to

372
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:35,155
shut down these, factories and it was
affecting the inventory management.

373
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:37,765
Like, they couldn't
manufacture a lot of things.

374
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:38,135
So.

375
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,610
Even though there was demand
the supply was going down supply

376
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,720
was Just what is available in?

377
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,470
warehouses or whatever
is there in transit?

378
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:55,290
So there was a lot of shortages for a lot
of items and it cost the prices to shoot

379
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,560
up Costing inflation and so on right?

380
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,730
So even now, there is an influence of
COVID 19 on forecasting systems with

381
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,260
respect to data handling and like, like
having a different consumer behaviors.

382
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,890
A lot of retailers have to, you know,
rethink their forecasting systems.

383
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,080
And it actually, you know, thought
about, brought in a change with respect

384
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,980
to having, resilient and flexible
forecasting systems in the industry.

385
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,373
So, how do we forecast these
demand and the metrics that

386
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:33,580
are key for retailers, right?

387
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:39,670
So, on a high level, there are three
classes of, actually, three classes I'm

388
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,235
going to talk about, which is, these
are the most common, but there are more.

389
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:49,455
First, we have statistical models, right?

390
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:53,855
Which includes methods like,
ARIMA or exponential smoothing.

391
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:59,925
And these models work really well
for, detecting simple trends,

392
00:27:59,935 --> 00:28:01,645
seasonality, and stability.

393
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:07,895
develop stable environments, but
they struggle a lot with rapid and

394
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:12,675
complex shifts in the data because
they rely a lot on historical

395
00:28:12,685 --> 00:28:15,785
data and linear patterns, right?

396
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:18,505
Next, we have machine learning models.

397
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:24,955
Unlike statistical models, these are data
driven and they can capture nonlinear

398
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:26,775
relationships between variables.

399
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:33,840
we can also incorporate external
factors such as weather, promotions,

400
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:39,560
even competitive behaviors, into the
forecast, and that makes it, more robust

401
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,525
compared to statistical models, right?

402
00:28:43,165 --> 00:28:46,855
Then we have deep learning models,
specifically neural networks

403
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:49,445
like RNN, LSTMs, and so on.

404
00:28:50,115 --> 00:28:55,155
These models are particularly
effective, for time series forecasting

405
00:28:55,155 --> 00:28:58,115
in complex and dynamic environments.

406
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:02,465
I mean, they can process vast
amount of data and find hidden

407
00:29:02,465 --> 00:29:05,445
patterns that other, models can't.

408
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:12,505
but, one caveat here is as we go for more
complex models, like deep learning models.

409
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,630
We need more and more data, right?

410
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,970
Like, if you have only let's say
50 data points deep learning models

411
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:23,140
might not be The right approach even
a statistic statistical models or a

412
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:28,220
simple models might even naive models
could perform better than deep learning

413
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,190
models just something to keep in mind.

414
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,220
So talking about statistical
Forecasting techniques and there are

415
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,900
many i'm just i'm going to touch upon.

416
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:44,140
the to common and most popular ones
that's, being used in the industry,

417
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,050
which is the ARIMA, which stands
for autoregressive integrated moving

418
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,900
average for time series forecasting.

419
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:55,540
And then there are, different flavors
of exponential smoothing that is, right

420
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,030
for detecting trends and seasonality.

421
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:02,535
so there is the exponential
smoothing is in different kinds.

422
00:30:02,555 --> 00:30:06,625
They can be a simple exponential
model to like seasonal ones

423
00:30:06,645 --> 00:30:08,175
like holds winter and so on.

424
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:12,675
but they're extremely useful in
detecting trends and seasonality.

425
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:16,255
we could also be using
regression analysis to understand

426
00:30:16,255 --> 00:30:17,545
relationship between variables.

427
00:30:18,255 --> 00:30:22,785
just, so I've seen people using regression
analysis for forecasting as well, like.

428
00:30:23,175 --> 00:30:26,075
it needs to be carefully examined
because of the assumptions

429
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,595
of the regression analysis.

430
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:32,795
So the, these models are simple,
interpretable, and they're really

431
00:30:32,795 --> 00:30:34,965
good for relatively stable demand.

432
00:30:35,345 --> 00:30:39,655
one of the problem here is, in highly
volatile or nonlinear environment,

433
00:30:39,665 --> 00:30:41,555
they may not be the best choice.

434
00:30:43,615 --> 00:30:47,775
then comes the data science and
machine learning techniques.

435
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:52,885
Moving beyond traditional
statistics, data science and machine

436
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:58,655
learning have transformed how we
approach forecasting in retail.

437
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:04,715
Machine learning models such as let's
say decision tree, random forest,

438
00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:10,475
and gradient boosting can process
enormous amount of data and make

439
00:31:10,475 --> 00:31:13,855
sense of complex non linear patterns.

440
00:31:14,585 --> 00:31:20,715
So one of the key advantages of machine
learning is its ability to handle large

441
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:27,565
data sets, incorporate multiple variables,
including external factors like promotion,

442
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:29,855
weather, or even social media trends.

443
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:34,095
for instance, a machine learning
model might predict increased

444
00:31:34,135 --> 00:31:39,405
demand for a product if it detects
a sudden surge in online searches

445
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:41,245
or social media mention, right?

446
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:45,885
Machine learning models are also
adaptive, unlike statistical models

447
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:48,495
that rely on predefined rules.

448
00:31:49,055 --> 00:31:53,895
Machine learning models learn and
adjust as new data becomes available.

449
00:31:54,365 --> 00:32:00,595
This means that they can quickly
detect shifts in consumer behaviors

450
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,605
and adjust forecasts accordingly.

451
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:09,425
one example is, how some retailers use
machine learning to predict the success of

452
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:14,415
a new product, product launch by analyzing
social media trends, historical sales

453
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:17,875
data, or even, influencer mentions, right?

454
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:20,425
this was an interesting case
study by one of the retailers.

455
00:32:21,235 --> 00:32:22,735
However, there are trade offs.

456
00:32:22,785 --> 00:32:28,415
machine learning Models, require more
data than statistical models, and also

457
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:32,535
they require greater computational
power compared to traditional methods.

458
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:38,055
And they're highly flexible, but at
the same time they're also more complex

459
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:42,115
and harder to interpret, especially
when, it comes to understanding

460
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:43,220
why the model made up data.

461
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,710
A specific, prediction, right?

462
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,060
There are explainable models as
well, but like, they're all, they're

463
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,080
all still considered black box.

464
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,410
We can, make, explain, the model,
features at a high level, but still

465
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:02,350
the, stakeholders and the business,
folks who make operational decisions,

466
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,390
still don't understand at the core.

467
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,420
And there's a trust issue when it
comes to machine learning models.

468
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,600
And these things need to be carefully
implemented, when productionizing.

469
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,940
The other class of model
is deep learning models.

470
00:33:17,015 --> 00:33:20,955
I've mentioned two of them, there
are different others as well, but,

471
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:26,605
RNNs, for time series data, like if
you have sequential patterns, RNNs,

472
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:31,475
RNNs picks it up very well, same
thing, LSTM networks specifically, for

473
00:33:31,485 --> 00:33:33,945
capturing long term dependencies, right?

474
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,565
So, like even, even, so if you.

475
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,740
model, like even like they can capture
like external, what do you call it?

476
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,810
factors as well, like events,
promotions and so on, along with

477
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,320
capturing the sequence based, patterns.

478
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:56,230
and they are usually really
good for long term forecasting.

479
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,370
and what I've seen is like a retailer
could use LSTM model to predict

480
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,720
for a new product category over the
next 12 months, taking into account

481
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,310
sales, data, competitor, competitor
actions, and even economic trends.

482
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,670
however, deep learning models
comes at a very high cost.

483
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,970
They have very high training times,
complexity, and they require significant

484
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:27,490
amount of data, computational
resources, making them more suitable

485
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,120
for larger retailers with big data sets.

486
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,720
One of the bigger drawback, according
to me, is they can be challenging to

487
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,540
interpret as their decision making
process is often seen as a black box

488
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,890
compared to more transparent methods
like regression or statistical methods.

489
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:55,295
So this is a few tips on, implementing,
time series models, in the industry

490
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:57,215
or for specifically your, use case.

491
00:34:57,635 --> 00:34:59,985
this is very, extremely critical, right.

492
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:03,125
On, on trying to understand which
models to start with, right.

493
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:07,285
In the first place, I've seen like
people jumping right into, complex

494
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:12,295
models, but, they don't achieve the
results that you're looking for.

495
00:35:12,415 --> 00:35:12,685
Right.

496
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:15,465
So, according to me, these findings.

497
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,800
Super important starting with EDA.

498
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,910
EDA is extremely important to
Understanding the task and exploring

499
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:30,860
your data It is crucial to first conduct
EDA to get a sense of data's patterns

500
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:37,230
trends and outliers This ensures that
you're not missing any key insights and

501
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,130
helps you verify that you're solving the
right problem with the correct approach.

502
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,140
It also solves a bunch of other
issues like, Oh, looking at the data

503
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:49,150
quality and like getting ideas for
your forecasting problems and so on.

504
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,290
Also check for gaps and
stationarity in the time series.

505
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:59,960
Time series models often require
stationarity and gaps in the data can

506
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,570
seriously disrupt forecasting accuracy.

507
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:09,050
Addressing these issues early
on will save you trouble later.

508
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:13,715
Now if you're talking about
evaluation, select the right

509
00:36:13,725 --> 00:36:16,125
evaluation metrics for your problem.

510
00:36:16,695 --> 00:36:21,985
Depending on your goals, you might use
MAPE, WMAPE, or any other metrics, but,

511
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:30,445
don't forget to use simple benchmarks
like Naive Forecasting set a baseline.

512
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:35,015
If your advanced models can't beat
this, there is something wrong, right?

513
00:36:35,455 --> 00:36:39,395
And when it comes to models, start
simple, avoid diving straight into

514
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:44,555
deep learning or LSTM unless you have
plenty of data, simpler models can often

515
00:36:44,555 --> 00:36:49,545
be more effective and interpretable,
especially when data is limited, right?

516
00:36:49,915 --> 00:36:53,795
And another thing is
about interpretability.

517
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:58,095
It is extremely essential
to know your models, right?

518
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:02,255
You should be able to explain why
you selected a particular model and

519
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:07,335
understand how it works under the hood
If you can't justify your choice, it is

520
00:37:07,395 --> 00:37:10,445
it's a sign that something's off, right?

521
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:15,775
there are many other aspects you need
to consider while implementing such

522
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:21,735
a system forecasting systems, but
Generally, i've seen people making

523
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:26,265
mistakes with respect to these right, so

524
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:33,230
Next, let's quickly go over some case
studies on like some practical ways.

525
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,780
Some retailers have

526
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:41,800
Fixed used forecasting to solve some
real world challenges The I don't

527
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:46,260
have specifics on how they on certain
aspects certain details, but like

528
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:52,000
this will give an overview about
how Companies are using it, right?

529
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:56,170
So in this case study, we are looking
at a global retailer with over 10,

530
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,745
000 stores across different regions.

531
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:05,975
Their primary challenge was frequent
stockouts, especially during peak seasons.

532
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:10,285
This led to lost sales, customer
dissatisfaction, and inefficiency

533
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:11,765
in managing supply chains.

534
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:16,065
The company's incident
management was largely reactive.

535
00:38:16,485 --> 00:38:19,805
Whenever stock odds occurred, the
supply chain team had to rush to

536
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:24,155
make last minute replenishments
with significantly increased costs.

537
00:38:24,895 --> 00:38:28,825
To address this, the retailer
implemented a machine learning

538
00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:30,555
based demand forecasting system.

539
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:37,300
This model didn't just rely on historical
sales data, but also incorporated External

540
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:42,310
factors like weather, regional events,
to predict demand more accurately.

541
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,870
they saw, due to this, they
saw a 30 percent reduction in

542
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,830
stockouts during peak seasons.

543
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,220
And they also managed to cut down
on emergency logistics by 25%,

544
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:57,756
leading to more cost effective
replenishment of the inventory, right?

545
00:38:57,756 --> 00:39:02,340
Most importantly, the incident
management process shifted from

546
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,480
being reactive to proactive.

547
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,070
instead of waiting for stockouts to
occur, the forecasting model provided

548
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,000
early warnings so that they could address
the issue before it impacted the store.

549
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,610
This not only reduced the operational
stress, but also improved customer

550
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,150
satisfaction as products were
consistently available when needed.

551
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,750
This is a great example of, of how.

552
00:39:27,805 --> 00:39:32,865
proactive incident management can
lead to, extremely, well balanced

553
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:38,425
and, highly efficient, system
and how it can lead to customer,

554
00:39:38,535 --> 00:39:40,365
improvement in customer experience.

555
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:41,225
Right.

556
00:39:41,395 --> 00:39:46,335
the next one is around, QSR chain, QSR
stands for, Quick service restaurants

557
00:39:46,335 --> 00:39:51,515
like fast food restaurants like
McDonald's and KFC and and so on right?

558
00:39:51,935 --> 00:39:55,955
So their main challenge was supply
chain disruptions which led to

559
00:39:55,975 --> 00:40:01,470
ingredient shortages And, and it
caused major service delays when, let's

560
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,940
say, certain ingredients, ran out.

561
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:07,530
Customers were unhappy because
popular menu items weren't available.

562
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,570
Like, imagine eating a, a
burger when, without lettuce.

563
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,890
I mean, they won't sell it, but
still, like, if the lettuce was,

564
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,690
not available, the companies or
the stores couldn't make the, such

565
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,450
products involving lettuce, right?

566
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:27,395
So even, same thing, their incident
management team was mostly reactive

567
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:32,145
and constantly responding to these
disruptions rather than preventing them.

568
00:40:32,815 --> 00:40:36,385
This resulted in higher costs
and more importantly, a negative

569
00:40:36,385 --> 00:40:38,245
impact on the customer experience.

570
00:40:38,775 --> 00:40:44,555
And later the QSR chain introduced
AI driven demand forecasting models.

571
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:49,550
The model analyzed a wide range of
data, historical sales, weather, And

572
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:54,030
eventually they were able to achieve
20 percent shortage in ingredient,

573
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,680
in ingredient shortages, right?

574
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:02,280
And the forecasting model allowed
the chain to plan ahead, ensure

575
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,030
that supplies are delivered on
time in the right quantities.

576
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:13,215
and the forecasting system helped,
reduce the food wastage by 15 percent

577
00:41:13,215 --> 00:41:17,305
as they could better align this,
supply with actual demand, right?

578
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:21,835
So this is a move towards achieving
sustainability goals as well.

579
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:26,965
So as a result, their incident
management became proactive with

580
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:29,195
better supplier coordination.

581
00:41:31,145 --> 00:41:38,195
So this is how you can at several
companies, are using forecasting to

582
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:41,345
drive, customer experience and reduce.

583
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,620
become more reactive, become
more proactive, supply chain

584
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,860
and develop proactive incident
management systems, right?

585
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:56,260
Now what's up, about the future for,
forecasting in the retail world?

586
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,120
There are several key trends.

587
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:02,730
we see an increasing use of IOT
data for real time inventory

588
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,020
tracking and management.

589
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,240
Right.

590
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:10,890
So these are more data coming in at
a very high pace, which will help

591
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:14,890
us, make more, real time decisions.

592
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,600
And then, there's another, trend
that's being seen in the industry,

593
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,130
which is to incorporate social media
and external data for demand sensing.

594
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:26,725
when talking about external data, there
are data from events, like, let's say

595
00:42:26,725 --> 00:42:32,445
a concert or, or sports events and so
on, as well as, with a lot of consumers

596
00:42:32,455 --> 00:42:37,665
being online, we have more and more
data about their presence, their

597
00:42:37,665 --> 00:42:39,815
shopping habits, their trends and so on.

598
00:42:40,205 --> 00:42:44,155
So companies have started,
incorporating such things into,

599
00:42:44,205 --> 00:42:46,165
into the demand sensing systems.

600
00:42:46,945 --> 00:42:49,935
Then, predictive analytics
for customer personalization

601
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:51,375
and marketing optimization.

602
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:52,865
it's self explanatory.

603
00:42:53,085 --> 00:42:57,115
like we see, all the e commerce
and like shopping websites giving

604
00:42:57,115 --> 00:43:00,665
us personalized recommendations,
sending marketing emails, and so on.

605
00:43:01,105 --> 00:43:04,745
also there's a lot of,
ethical, aspects, right?

606
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:10,615
because we Retailers, retailers collect
a lot of data, like when you enter

607
00:43:10,615 --> 00:43:12,365
your, there's your payment information.

608
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:15,765
There is, yes, transactions,
your, your interest.

609
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:21,115
So over a period of time, the companies
have a huge, huge, huge, data, And

610
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:23,265
they know a lot about you, right?

611
00:43:23,275 --> 00:43:26,885
They collect data and they see the
trends and they have millions of

612
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:31,655
such customers online for these
big retailers and they know what

613
00:43:31,655 --> 00:43:32,875
you like and what you don't like.

614
00:43:32,885 --> 00:43:38,145
And some countries, some regions,
they have their own privacy

615
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:39,885
rules and data rules and so on.

616
00:43:39,895 --> 00:43:45,305
So that's, having an impact these days and
companies are getting more, taking more

617
00:43:45,315 --> 00:43:46,775
actions on their ethical friends as well.

618
00:43:47,855 --> 00:43:49,845
So now also.

619
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:55,515
A lot of companies have achieved this the
fully automated demand sensing forecasting

620
00:43:55,515 --> 00:44:01,945
systems driven by AI there's a huge trend
right now with llms generative ai and

621
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:07,425
personally in the industry I think it
would be a great great Tool, you know to

622
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:13,665
synthesize a lot of natural language with
respect to let's say Forums social media

623
00:44:13,665 --> 00:44:19,585
forums and like social media data and
text data and synthesize that As, features

624
00:44:19,585 --> 00:44:26,655
into the demand sensing models to, capture
those peak peaks in the demand, right?

625
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:27,035
So,

626
00:44:29,775 --> 00:44:36,285
and as I said, like, there's a lot of
uncertainty volatility, with respect

627
00:44:36,285 --> 00:44:41,555
to retail and retailers must adopt, AI
powered models to remain competitive.

628
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,080
That's that's that's
there's no doubt about that.

629
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,880
The forecasting has come a long way,
but there is a need for continuous

630
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:58,175
innovation right So demand forecasting
cannot just rely on traditional

631
00:44:58,175 --> 00:45:04,705
statistics with customer preferences and
marketing conditions shifting so rapidly.

632
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:09,015
the businesses need models that can
learn, adapt, predict in real time.

633
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:13,830
And Then this means that they need
to invest in scalable forecasting

634
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:18,000
systems that are capable of
processing large data sets quickly

635
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,720
and generating accurate predictions.

636
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:22,390
the other key point is collaboration.

637
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,150
retailers need to work closely with
data scientists and technology providers

638
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:31,980
to ensure their forecasting models are
not only accurate, but also flexible

639
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,910
enough to respond to new challenges.

640
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,280
The complexity of today's retail
environment, means that no single team or

641
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,670
department can tackle these issues alone.

642
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:50,980
One example of, continuous, innovation,
is, is, with the Retailer X.

643
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,940
I mean they have a I powered forecasting
system that predicts the demand for

644
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:01,740
products to individual store location by
integrating multiple sources including

645
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:06,940
store traffic weather online behavior so
they can this retailer can predict the

646
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:11,370
demand shifts in real time and adjust
their inventory accordingly like even at

647
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:15,675

term gains so those who can harness

650
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,230
the power of AI and machine learning
to forecast demand accurately, will

651
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:38,440
not only enhance their operational
efficiency, but also gain a critical

652
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:45,290
