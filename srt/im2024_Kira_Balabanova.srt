1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,359
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,490
Thank you for joining in today.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,140
I'm Kyra.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,559
I'm a product manager with over 10
years of experience in building B2B and

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,320
B2C products, preferably in fintech.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,879
And now I'm working as a product
lead at Neboos, a fintech service

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,830
that provides access to traditional
finance products and cryptocurrencies.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,235
And today I want to speak about
strategies for incorporating

9
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:30,665
compliance into product development.

10
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,574
You may ask me, why, compliance?

11
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:35,315
Why do you focus on compliance?

12
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:40,594
Because, when you're working on a
digital product, you always work in a

13
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:47,909
cross functional, team, where all the
departments involved like marketing,

14
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,479
support, finance, you name it.

15
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:54,699
So why am I focusing on compliance?

16
00:00:55,549 --> 00:01:01,899
That's because in highly regulated
sectors, there are a lot on the line.

17
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:08,264
So being fully compliant with all the
regulatory requirements is crucial.

18
00:01:09,554 --> 00:01:14,714
compliance department, is in charge
for following industry regulation

19
00:01:14,994 --> 00:01:20,154
for reducing any risks the company
faces and for building trust.

20
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:23,524
trust, of the customers.

21
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:28,684
And also trust of the, regulators
from the government and so on.

22
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:36,304
And failing compliance can lead to
fines, reputation damage, customer

23
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,274
loss, and as a severe consequence.

24
00:01:39,654 --> 00:01:45,074
So that's why today I want to focus
on how to deal with compliance, how to

25
00:01:45,074 --> 00:01:49,504
involve compliance professionals into
your product development life cycle.

26
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,564
And that's it.

27
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,669
So what is compliance in Fintech?

28
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:04,019
there's some key elements of compliance,
such like regulatory requirements, AML

29
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,660
and KYC, which stands for anti money
laundering and know your customer,

30
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:14,270
and sometimes data protection because
from company to company it may vary.

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,390
Sometimes compliance is in
charge of data protection.

32
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,119
Sometimes it is, the part of
responsibilities of the other departments.

33
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:27,809
again, why it matters, it's because,
that's a lot on the line, that

34
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:33,299
because the stakes are high in highly
regulated industries, and Compliance

35
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:39,239
Department, Helps to build and
establish trust and ensure safety and

36
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,919
mitigate any risks a company can face.

37
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:47,489
And the consequence of non
compliance are really severe.

38
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:53,739
So it's not only legal penalties or
reputation harm or operational disruption.

39
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:57,319
it's gonna even lead to business closure.

40
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:05,149
So there are the key components,
from the technological point of view.

41
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:07,859
So first of all, KYC and KYT, which is.

42
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:12,529
Know your customer and know your
transactions in anti money laundering.

43
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:17,779
Also it's rec tech, any kinds
of compliance management system.

44
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:24,389
And of course, AI based fraud detection
and KYT, KYC automation solutions,

45
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:30,480
because, nowadays there are a lot of
players on the market and the client wants

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,760
to, that transaction to be very fast.

47
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:37,945
And there are a lot of transactions,
so the client won't, wait for,

48
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:40,835
hours to the transaction to perform.

49
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:46,675
The client won't, wait for KYC
procedure to perform, for, days.

50
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:52,405
that's impossible without
AI based solutions.

51
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:59,855
what are the common problem of cross
functional collaboration challenges and

52
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,915
how it's effect to compliance relations?

53
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:09,575
first of all, it's very common to
have communication silos due to

54
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:11,545
limited interaction between teams.

55
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:18,725
But, the truth is that if you have
cis you are very likely to have a

56
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,585
limited interaction between teams.

57
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:24,715
And if you have a limited in, if
you have a limited interaction,

58
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:27,745
you're highly likely to have cis.

59
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,275
Because teams doesn't talk to each
other, teams doesn't communicate.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,010
Teams doesn't found, like the
common things, like common

61
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,580
goals and common ideas.

62
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,610
So yeah, it's a very common, mistake.

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,740
The second is late
involvement of compliance.

64
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,580
So sometimes compliance
introduced when it's too late.

65
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,410
And there's a reason why it happens.

66
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,670
Because, when a product
manager and product team.

67
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,620
is inspired by an idea.

68
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,270
you just want to deploy this.

69
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,060
You just want to make it live.

70
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,610
You just want to experiment.

71
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,860
And sometimes compliance person
ask too many questions because

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,180
there's a lot on the line.

73
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,840
They're in charge of
very important things.

74
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,120
So they don't know what to do.

75
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,230
They ask challenging questions,
and sometimes the product team

76
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,410
is not so happy with answering.

77
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,400
They want to move fast,
they want time to market.

78
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,200
And sometimes it can look like compliance
put, the sticks through the wheels, but,

79
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,180
really they're just doing their work.

80
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,110
So if you're involving compliance
professionals, too late, It's highly

81
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,800
likely will lead to, late issues.

82
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,660
So when something important
turn out to be so very late on

83
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,520
the later stage of the project.

84
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,370
And the third one is about balancing.

85
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,500
Um, deploy and developing fintech or
other highly regulated, industries

86
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,950
product is always a balance between
innovation and regulation, which means

87
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,690
that you are always should be aware, how
risky is what you are trying to deploy.

88
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,770
For example, me as a product
manager, I think like all other,

89
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,390
every other product managers, I
want as many clients as we can.

90
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:35,510
So if we have a hundred clients a day,
please, I want all of them to use our

91
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,730
application to perform transactions.

92
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:45,930
But compliance specialists understand
that they're like some percent of those

93
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,780
customers are not a good customers who
will be paying bills, paying for the

94
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,930
coffee, paying for everyday life expenses.

95
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,585
But they will pay.

96
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:58,965
Perform some fraud and so on.

97
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:05,035
So that's always balancing between
what we can get and what's on the line.

98
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:10,425
So early engagement,
is the key to success.

99
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:14,015
When we talk about working
with compliance professionals.

100
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:20,645
So I would recommend to involve
compliance from ideation.

101
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:24,805
So from very early stage of your project.

102
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:31,225
So normally when I have some idea and
I understand that it's not just you,

103
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:36,365
improvement and, I am very likely
to ask compliance professionals.

104
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:41,595
I have a quick call with
one of my colleagues.

105
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:48,765
And just share this idea and sometimes
I have a very good piece of advice

106
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:54,605
of how to transform this idea in
something fully compliant, how to make

107
00:07:54,605 --> 00:08:01,635
sure that we won't fail and we won't
engage in non compliance and so on.

108
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:06,385
So also, it's very important to
foster a culture of collaboration.

109
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,860
So that's when you, when you
are happy to interact with your

110
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,110
compliance professional colleagues.

111
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:20,435
on the daily basis, when you are
grateful for their questions, when

112
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:25,665
you're grateful for their comments, and
when you are really listening to them.

113
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:28,695
everybody appreciate when someone listens.

114
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:34,435
I think this culture may be
fostered in every organization.

115
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:40,845
the benefits of such an approach,
a few last minutes issues, smoothie

116
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:46,205
launches and overall better
atmosphere in your, company.

117
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,245
So what.

118
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:54,855
I do personally to, implement
seamlessly compliance into

119
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:56,635
product development process.

120
00:08:57,255 --> 00:09:04,815
first of all, I, integrated compliance
to design of all the products we produce.

121
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:10,555
So on the early stages, a compliance
professional is a part of a cross

122
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:15,785
functional team and, We listen
to the questions, we listen to

123
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:18,765
advice and we shape our product.

124
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,330
in accordance with what our
compliance colleagues say.

125
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,420
Other thing is to clarify roles,
because you know sometimes there

126
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,090
are several people in charge of
other parts of compliance process.

127
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:40,050
For example, you have one person in
charge for KYC and KYB, the other person

128
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,775
is in charge for KYT, and the third
person is in charge of, KYC and KYT.

129
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:50,955
communication with partners,
risk appetites, and so on.

130
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:54,045
So make sure that you are
with the right person.

131
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:59,385
And if you need to involve all the
three persons, you should involve them.

132
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:06,290
And all in all, the, you should be
to have a regular meetings with,

133
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,130
compliance, regular compliance review.

134
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,930
it's not only product demo when you
like show everything you produced.

135
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,530
Recommend to have a separate meetings
dedicated to compliance needs.

136
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,580
I personally do such meetings
once every two weeks.

137
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,010
It's 30 minutes, just to make sure we
are on the same page with the colleagues,

138
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,760
make sure that nothing is missing,
that we didn't miss any news, any

139
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,495
upcoming audit or something like that.

140
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,585
let's talk about methodologies and tools
that, helps, me to deal with, compliance.

141
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:52,410
First of all, the agile product,
development is a very good, in

142
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,670
perspective, because that regulation,
very volatile and risk appetite

143
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,890
of partners, even more volatile.

144
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,180
So everything can change
very rapidly and agile.

145
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,870
A very good solution for that because
you don't need to wait for a long

146
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,410
cycle of development, to integrate
some new compliance ideas or tasks

147
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,040
you just have to you could just have
deployment every two weeks so you can.

148
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,930
be very rapid in addressing
compliance issues.

149
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:36,100
Also, I think it's important to use
risk assessment frameworks and make it

150
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:42,620
clear for all the team and proactively
identify the risk and address the risks.

151
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:52,665
Also, you may understand that Compliance
is not a one off action, it's a continuous

152
00:11:52,685 --> 00:12:01,095
process, so everything is changing rapidly
and audit is coming like every quarter

153
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:09,975
or every year, so you should continuously
include compliance tasks in your sprints.

154
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:16,605
So let's talk about software we
use to address compliance tasks.

155
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:23,955
first of all, we automated all the tasks
and when compliance professional need

156
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:29,505
something from a product development
team, they can address the JIRA, create

157
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:35,765
a ticket, and then we can discard
this ticket, in person, being sure

158
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:38,775
that everything is track traceable.

159
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,500
so we use Jira, for
this, for, task tracking.

160
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:49,530
we also use Confluent for all the
documents available for every member of

161
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:58,600
the team, so we always can refer to risk
appetite for compliance rules and so on.

162
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,980
And we also use Slack for
day to day communication and

163
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,830
Trello for, for meeting notes.

164
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:14,260
And as I mentioned before, we use
AI in, for, process automation,

165
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:20,780
such like KYT, KYC, and for, in
blockchain, for data integrity.

166
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,600
So what else can I share with you?

167
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,470
Let's talk about the best
practice for building a

168
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,590
compliance culture in the company.

169
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,410
So I think everyone who works.

170
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:41,895
In highly regulated industries, our
finance and so on, knows about trainings

171
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:48,885
and those trainings are regular and
they are usually very boring and

172
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:55,030
nobody loved those trainings, but
apart from them, that's very useful.

173
00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:00,540
To have some workshops with compliance
professionals because sometimes they

174
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,020
can share some issue they addressed
the previous week or previous

175
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,390
months, some use from the industry.

176
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,120
And this is really helpful and really fun.

177
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,395
Continuous monitoring and
adaptive regulatory changes.

178
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:21,135
as I mentioned, it can be 30 minutes,
meetings every two weeks or every week.

179
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:26,195
It can be, inviting a compliance
professional to your daily stand

180
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:31,445
up or anything you wish, but it
should be a continuous process.

181
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:40,775
And the third one, I highly recommend to
document everything regarding compliance.

182
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:46,695
I know that the most companies, the
most, software development is agile.

183
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:52,655
So the word of the product is
more important than documentation.

184
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:55,425
But, if we talk about compliance.

185
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:59,615
It's crucial to be very precise.

186
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:06,125
So document everything, store this
in Jira in Confluence or elsewhere

187
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:10,415
you, your company choose, but,
I, I really recommend to do that.

188
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:14,775
So let's sum up all said.

189
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,130
compliance is crucial for safety,
trust, and market success, and

190
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,490
even for company existence.

191
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,290
If we talk about highly regulated
industries about finance, for example,

192
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,000
early integration of compliance
professional into product development and

193
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:43,640
clear understanding of the roles are very
important when we talk about compliance.

194
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:43,775
Thanks.

195
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:50,025
And the third one that using
technologies and continuous

196
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:52,775
learning is a key to stay ahead.

197
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,325
Thank you so much for
your attention today.

198
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:02,545
let's discuss any questions
or challenges you may have.

199
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,685
I'll be more than happy
to answer your questions.
