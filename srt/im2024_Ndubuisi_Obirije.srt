00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,009
Hi, my name is Ndubuisi Obirije.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,020
I'm the co founder and CTO of Afreex.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,510
welcome to my session.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,720
on discomfort to incident
management conference.

5
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:17,599
I'll be talking about AI power
detection and monitoring of social

6
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:22,239
engineering driven fraudulent
payments and remittances.

7
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:27,470
let's start with the growing
threats of remittance fintech.

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:34,789
social engineering, is a situation where,
there's a manipulation of individuals to

9
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,719
gain access to sensitive information, or
perform actions that benefit a fraudster.

10
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,100
in the remittance world, this could
involve, tracking someone, into,

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,239
tracking someone in their email, and
also tricking them to give access,

12
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:57,199
give the fraudulent or the fraudster
access, to, an innocent, person's

13
00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:00,739
email, social media pages, et cetera.

14
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:03,259
And basically once this is done, you.

15
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:08,204
It essentially tricks, the
victim into authorizing

16
00:01:08,294 --> 00:01:11,714
payments, for these fraudsters.

17
00:01:12,474 --> 00:01:14,744
social engineering is
like a circle, right?

18
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:18,904
usually fraudsters start by
gathering information, right?

19
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:23,214
After gathering information, they
could, send you a phishing email.

20
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:29,674
they could buy data online,
of their potential victims.

21
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:34,294
And then once they've done that, they
now establish relationships, right?

22
00:01:34,654 --> 00:01:38,035
they try to get in touch
with their victims.

23
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:40,635
and to establish like a connection, right?

24
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:46,435
So the victims don't become suspicious
at all when the exploitation starts.

25
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:50,175
So after establishing relationship,
it goes on to exploitation.

26
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:54,805
So at this stage, the victims
don't realize they are, they're

27
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:57,445
in the nets of this fraudsters.

28
00:01:57,905 --> 00:02:01,505
and then the next thing is
execution, those fraudsters.

29
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,240
execute their plan, it could be to,
trick the customers, trick the victims

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,420
into making a payment online through
Amazon, through eBay, et cetera.

31
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:21,398
but before we start going deep into,
what these explanations are, let's

32
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:28,350
look at AI in fintech, let's look at
some key statistics, of what the impact

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,670
of AI, have right now in the sector.

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,370
basically it's transforming
the sector as it's called.

35
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,380
We've seen chat GPT, we've seen,
cloud, from Entropiq and the

36
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,430
other, LLMs out there today.

37
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,930
And this AI can help give us valuable
insight into the adoption of, FinTech.

38
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,840
And I think it's just the, it's just
the tip of the iceberg right now.

39
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,530
Some of the key things we've, we've
seen is, there's exploitative,

40
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,140
explosive growth, right?

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,800
the global fintech market is
currently worth 340 billion, with

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,305
the AI segment valued at 44 billion.

43
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:14,505
Now, the AI share in fintech is expected
to reach 50 billion over the next five

44
00:03:14,515 --> 00:03:19,155
years, and then there's widespread
adaptation, 72 percent of companies that

45
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:25,115
utilize, utilizes AI, in one of their
key business functions, And others are

46
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:30,935
planning to even expand to use it and
expand on, using data technologies and

47
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:32,815
AI technologies for their businesses.

48
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,250
Now, also it's helps in key cost savings.

49
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:41,335
Implementing AI in businesses.

50
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:47,965
We have seen that, it saves companies,
businesses, millions of dollars.

51
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:52,315
So it's, for example, implementing
identity verification for banks

52
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:57,465
is projected to 900 million in
operational costs reduction.

53
00:03:58,015 --> 00:03:59,875
this is massive, right?

54
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:06,075
Onboarding process are now digital
and onboarding process would be

55
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:12,175
close to 29 million hours, in, in, in
onboarding process for banks and most

56
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:15,075
key fintechs today, this is massive.

57
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:21,695
And this also improves the customer
service, section of these companies.

58
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:25,445
we can see charts boards, That
started years ago, we've seen

59
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:31,285
virtual assistants, from, chat GPT,
real time, voice communication.

60
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:36,125
I'm excited, and I think the
feature is exciting for real

61
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:37,725
time customer interactions.

62
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:40,175
it reduces cost of inquiries.

63
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:41,705
then there's enhanced.

64
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,039
Efficiency in the every time to
spend, every time spent by digital

65
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,290
onboarding have drastically
reduced by 30%, thanks to AI.

66
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,195
So these are like highlighting
some of the potential of, of AI

67
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,685
in our financial space, today.

68
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:05,425
now let's talk back to what's
back to what we're thinking about.

69
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:07,405
fraud stars and fraud lend transactions.

70
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:08,785
So what are financial crimes?

71
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:09,625
today.

72
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:12,175
So there's financial crime
and then there's compliance.

73
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:16,945
Now, financial crime isn't any
activity that involves financial gain.

74
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:22,250
by using illegal means, even if it
means hiding some processes from, their

75
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,250
victims, that is a financial crime and
then the compliance side, financial

76
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,970
compliance is when organizations
deploy in a strategies to prevent,

77
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,810
Financial crimes, strategies and reports
to prevent any illegal, activity.

78
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:48,130
Now, the, some of the shocking
statistics today is that there have

79
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:57,330
been over 800 billion to 2 trillion
worth of money laundry globally.

80
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,010
this is unprecedented.

81
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,860
And we are seeing this
number increase yearly.

82
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,020
And you know, the interesting
thing is this is not going to stop.

83
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:15,005
we don't have the capacity, the human
capacity to stop, financial crimes

84
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:18,585
and laundering, but we have a savior.

85
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:24,685
I know it's a heavy word to say savior,
but we have a tool that can actually

86
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:28,996
help us prevent so many types of fraud.

87
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:30,480
For example, phishing.

88
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,970
identity thefts, these are like one of
the two, two basic and two core, ways in

89
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,650
a first that can, do financial crimes.

90
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,390
So phishing is basically an attempt
to collect sensitive information, like

91
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,240
username, password, bank information, etc.

92
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:48,945
identity theft.

93
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:52,995
Identity theft involves stealing
someone's personal information, some

94
00:06:53,005 --> 00:07:00,655
for starts by credit cards, debit
cards, SSNs, IDs online, on, on forums,

95
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:04,855
and pose as this, as their victims.

96
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:08,195
Now, how do we leverage
AI to, to prevent this?

97
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,490
One, for phishing, with advanced machine
learning and algorithms, we can analyze

98
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,460
patterns of communication, right?

99
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,740
To, identify any phishing attempts, there
could be things like, the algorithms

100
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,100
that could check out for emails with
suspicion subjects and contacts.

101
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,320
And then this.

102
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:33,150
machines, this AI could alert, either
the owners or alerts companies,

103
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,240
especially when, this is targeted at
employees of a particular company.

104
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:44,830
And now for identity thefts, we can
leverage AI by, using current and

105
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,670
improving, identity verification
solutions, today, I think there's

106
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,630
a lot of room for improvements.

107
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:58,035
In identity verifications and AI is
there for us to, utilizes, utilize it.

108
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:02,225
Now, I know I've already
identified about two.

109
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:06,585
There are other types of other types,
which are not, they are also important,

110
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:10,125
but the two I initially mentioned
that like the core, these are like.

111
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,110
The, usually the first steps, for starts
try to, get, gain access to the victims.

112
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,060
Now, but there are other things
like money mulling, documents

113
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,140
forgery, accounts take over.

114
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,620
And, the interesting one, which
is most recent is deepfake.

115
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,230
we've seen the rise of, generative
AI, how it's easy to create deepfake

116
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,000
even in videos and in voice.

117
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,120
It's scary.

118
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,800
It's scary feature ahead, just as AI can
be used for, but it can also be used to

119
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,890
checkmate this, bad and, checkmate evil,
persons that want to use it for that.

120
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,550
no, I want to take a
breather and, highlights.

121
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,650
Some of the things I've seen, we've
seen in, in Nafra is my company,

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,950
we've seen over 80 percent accuracy
in flagging social engineering

123
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,160
attempts, in our platform.

124
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,800
This is huge, in less than three months
we deployed, AI solutions, to detect,

125
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,450
for the event activities, especially
such engineering, we've seen, we've seen

126
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:22,520
the patterns and we've identified those
patterns and AI is just there to automate

127
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,520
those patterns and catch them, and we've
seen 80 percent accuracy and we have saved

128
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,110
over 1 million in fraudulent transactions
in a very short period of time.

129
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,690
And we've also seen reduction in
false positives and investigative

130
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,890
time because, our compliance team
leverage, the transactions have been

131
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,710
flagged, but the potential, activity
that was flagged by our AI system.

132
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,430
it has really give, reduce
the investigation time

133
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,670
for our compliance team.

134
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,090
And, I know I've already spoken about,
the processes, or some of the activities

135
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,940
for stats and use, but just to break down
some of the common victims we've seen,

136
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:12,070
we've encountered, 70 plus years adults,
older adults, 70, and above, we've seen.

137
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,115
S fraudulent activities on this age group.

138
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,945
We've seen from 18 to 34 years,
we've seen from 34 to 50 and so on.

139
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:25,325
So every, age group does a
specific, they're all targets.

140
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,155
Everyone's a targets basically,
whether you're an older adult,

141
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:32,025
younger, your adults UA targets and.

142
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,010
it's not going to stop, it's
not going to stop anytime.

143
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,660
So, there have been surveys that
showcase, there's certain types of age

144
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:47,740
group that are susceptible to, fraud,
to fraud that are especially victims.

145
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,920
you can check that on my slide later.

146
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:59,070
So, to reiterate, I am very, I am
super excited on how AI solution

147
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,190
can combat financial cramps, it's
just, it's an emerging space.

148
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,070
None.

149
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,710
It's not a new, it's not a new
space, we've seen new emerging

150
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,300
technologies that is exciting.

151
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:16,575
to now advance the level of which
previous AI detections, is that, we can

152
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,725
now detect anomaly, we can now do real
time monitoring, we can do predictive

153
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:26,245
analytics, we can do network analytics
and with natural language processing,

154
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:30,740
we can now you know, for example,
someone who posed to be an African

155
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,380
American, but he's speaking like an
Asian American, from identity theft.

156
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,270
These are some of the things that AI
can detect and from natural language

157
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:43,750
processing and combats, those that poses
as other people, these are some of the

158
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,490
exciting things, we've seen out there.

159
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,500
So to wrap up, these are my key takeaway.

160
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:51,755
no one is immune.

161
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:53,485
Everyone

162
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:59,995
is, anyone, everyone can
