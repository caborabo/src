00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,720
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,090
This is Mahesh Tautam and
welcome to conference incident

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,420
management 2024 conference.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,939
I am here to discuss on
Azure cloud migration.

5
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:18,365
As we know, a lot of organizations are
moving from legacy on premises to a cloud.

6
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:24,066
So I want to discuss strategies, the
stack process, and the performance of your

7
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:29,104
meditation in your practice and I know
it's very emotional for a lot of people.

8
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:39,054
I came up with a lot of talk about, I
start on my, strategies, comparison of the

9
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:45,024
strategies and how could we successfully
migrate our, structures and then.

10
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:50,854
best practices and how to mitigate
them, performance optimization, and

11
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:52,854
then a case study with conclusion.

12
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,944
So starting with introduction.

13
00:00:55,954 --> 00:01:01,684
So the rapid evolution of cloud computing
has transformed the way enterprise

14
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:08,134
manage their IT infrastructure with
Microsoft Azure emerging as one of the

15
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,474
leading platforms for cloud adoption.

16
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:15,204
Businesses across the
globe are increasingly.

17
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:20,859
Turning to the cloud to unlock benefits
like enhancing the scalability, cost

18
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:23,509
efficiency, and operational agility.

19
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:29,009
By migrating to Azure, organization
can reduce their reliance on

20
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:34,429
traditional on premises data centers
and capitalize on the flexibility

21
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,529
that cloud solution offers.

22
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:43,559
Despite many advantages of cloud
migration, the process can be complex,

23
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:46,629
And we could fought with challenges.

24
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:54,469
A recent Flexure report indicates that by
end of 2024, 83 percent of the enterprise

25
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,009
wire loads will be hosted in the cloud.

26
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:02,009
Yet many organization faces
difficulties during migration.

27
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:05,479
These challenges often include.

28
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:12,809
unexpected costs, performance degradation,
and technical incompatibilities between

29
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,149
legacy system and cloud platforms.

30
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:22,269
Addressing these obstacles require
thorough planning, a deep understanding

31
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:30,199
of migration strategies, and continuous
performance optimization post migration.

32
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:36,409
I want to bring this, and talk about,
Azure cloud migration strategies.

33
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:39,109
So what are the strategies we do have?

34
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:44,489
we have re hosting, refactoring, re
architecting, rebuilding and replacing.

35
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:51,189
So each of them, I choose depending
upon how the organization uses the data

36
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,129
and how they build their infrastructure
and architecture of the data.

37
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,329
So first one, rehosting.

38
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,369
So it's probably a left hand shift.

39
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,909
We move all the application
with minimum changes.

40
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:09,419
It's a quick, low risk approach that
help businesses exist their data centers.

41
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:15,159
And this would be mostly with the
small organizations with less data.

42
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:20,829
And for refactoring, it involves
slight modifications to applications

43
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:26,069
to make them cloud ready, improving
their performance while leveraging

44
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:29,479
cloud native services like Azure PaaS.

45
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:35,649
And re architecturing, so
significant rework on application.

46
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:41,499
This, might take much time than the
other two strategies, but, we have to go

47
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:47,199
through the process of re architecting
all the data structures and breaking

48
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:51,879
the monolithic into microservices for
better scalability and reliability.

49
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:56,709
Rebuilding, so we'll be developing
a new application from scratch.

50
00:03:56,844 --> 00:04:02,234
Scratch using all the cloud native
services for full optimization

51
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,884
and performance replacing.

52
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:10,944
We will be substituting legacy apps
with SAS based solutions available on

53
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:14,814
Azure to reduce management overhead.

54
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:22,654
So coming to the comparison of
migration strategies, so migration

55
00:04:22,664 --> 00:04:24,854
strategies, benefits and trade offs.

56
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:28,004
Each strategy has its pros and cons.

57
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:33,014
As everything, the right choice
depends on factors such as applications

58
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:38,784
complexity, business cruciality,
and organization cloud maturity.

59
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:45,014
Rehosting, it's faster approach, but
does not leverage full capability.

60
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:49,034
Cloud benefits because we are
just lifting and shifting it.

61
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:55,994
So we might be missing a lot
of pros that we get with cloud

62
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:58,214
migration or moving to cloud.

63
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:01,854
So we can't get all of
them in rehosting strategy.

64
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:03,294
Refactoring.

65
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:09,744
introduces cloud native features with
medium complexity and implementation time.

66
00:05:10,674 --> 00:05:15,484
Re architecting, this is the
strategy where we start getting

67
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:19,384
to most of the cloud, advantages.

68
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:26,129
but require high time and effort because
we have to start it from architectural

69
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:31,129
stage Rebuilding it offers the greatest
clouding benefits, but again involves

70
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:37,269
significant resources and times Replacing
a suitable for non core business apps.

71
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,979
We are moving to sas can
be cost effective and fast.

72
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:50,189
So coming to the planning for a successful
migration, planning and assessment key to

73
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:55,609
success through planning and assessment
are essential for a smooth migration.

74
00:05:55,989 --> 00:06:00,359
This includes understanding
workloads, aligning business goals and

75
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:04,609
setting clear migration priorities.

76
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:10,174
So planning and assessing then
design and Build prototype reverse

77
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:15,664
engineering migration testing and
release this would take time based

78
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,769
And we cannot, give a timeline for
all of this process because it's based

79
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,469
upon the organization and the data.

80
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:32,699
So for workload evolution, evaluation,
identify application dependencies, access,

81
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:39,349
criticality, and determine suitable
migration strategies for each workload.

82
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:45,024
Skill assessment, ensure your team
has the required cloud expertise,

83
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:50,934
identify the gaps and develop training
or consider bringing an expert

84
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:56,014
who is good in Azure technologies.

85
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:59,084
Cost analysis and ROI projection.

86
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:05,024
We need to evaluate current
infrastructure's cost, project Azure

87
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:07,779
cost and estimate ROI over time.

88
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,689
short and long term period.

89
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:15,769
This ensures proper budgeting
and stakeholder buy in to

90
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,449
see what would be the cost.

91
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:23,939
Coming to the best practices
for Azure migration, best

92
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:26,279
practices for a smooth migration.

93
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:28,849
there is no term called smooth migration.

94
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:33,729
We would be facing issues while
doing this, but we can mitigate them.

95
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:35,159
So if we followed.

96
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:39,804
These steps we could, try to mitigate
most of the issues that we come up

97
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:46,454
while doing the migration so that
those would be reducing migration

98
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:48,884
risk and ensure optimal outcomes.

99
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:50,394
One is phased migration.

100
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:53,444
So we won't do everything in one go.

101
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:58,484
So implementing a gradual approach,
migrating workloads in phases.

102
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:03,794
test and validate each stage
before proceeding to reduce

103
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:06,334
risk and limit disruptions.

104
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:12,914
Security and compliance conducted
thorough security assessment of both

105
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:15,274
on premises and cloud environments.

106
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:22,984
Use Azure Security Center to monitor and
ensure compliance with industry standards.

107
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:28,014
Then comes data integrity,
audit and validate data before,

108
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:30,794
during, and after migration.

109
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:33,849
Tools like Azure Data Box help with this.
