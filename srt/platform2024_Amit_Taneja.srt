00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,829
Hey, hi, everyone.

2
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,019
My name is Amit Taneja.

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,400
Thank you so much for
joining me in the conference.

4
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,810
I'll be going through accelerating
pharmaceutical innovation.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,400
Leveraging AI and platform engineering
to revolutionize drug development.

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,110
Some of the table contents is,
I'll be going through traditional

7
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:35,919
drug discovery challenges, how AI
can play a transformative role in

8
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:40,660
drug discovery, the different AI
methodologies in drug discovery process.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,120
I'll also be going through
a couple of case studies.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,279
What are the different benefits of AI in
drug discovery, the different challenges

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,510
and the considerations and how the
future outlook for AI in drug discovery

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,709
looks like, and also the conclusion.

13
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,270
let's talk about the traditional
drug discovery challenges.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,310
one of the major thing is high cost.

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,970
The average cost to develop
a new drug exceeds over 2.

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,309
6 billion.

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,670
The long timelines on average,
it takes over 12 years to

18
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,000
develop and approve a new drug.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,074
Okay.

20
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:16,815
Inefficiency.

21
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:20,995
Traditional methods rely on
experimental screening, which

22
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:22,865
is time consuming and costly.

23
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:28,015
Now, using platform engineering, we
can a lot of, we can do the automation.

24
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:29,625
We can automate all these workflows.

25
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:34,095
So by automating workflows using
platform engineering practices, we can

26
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:38,495
streamline the drug discovery processes,
reduce any manual intervention,

27
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:40,685
improve operational efficiency.

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,030
Automated pipelines ensure data
moves seamlessly from one phase to

29
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,480
another, saving the time and resources.

30
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,070
AI is a transformative
role in drug discovery.

31
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,230
AI provides faster data analysis,
identifying promising drug

32
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,010
candidates with higher efficiency.

33
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,490
AI powered solutions predict
molecular interactions,

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,960
reducing drug discovery time.

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,300
AI improves accuracy with models
predicting success rates over 80%.

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,930
Now, we can scale.

37
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,090
It's a lot scalable, cloud
infrastructure in platform engineering.

38
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,960
Platform engineering enables scalable
cloud infrastructure that supports AI

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,540
models in processing large data sets,
optimizing the computer sources, and

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,350
reducing time for molecular analysis.

41
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,730
Scalable systems ensure that AI processes
grow dynamically with project needs.

42
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,900
Eliminating any bottlenecks.

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,650
Now, different AI methodologies
in drug discovery.

44
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,620
One of them is deep learning.

45
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,860
models like CNNs and RNNs analyze
chemical bioactivity data.

46
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,380
Virtual screening.

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,959
AI evaluates large chemical libraries,
identifying high potential compounds.

48
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,490
Molecular docking.

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,490
AI simulates molecular interactions,
predicting how the drugs can

50
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,270
actually will bind to the targets.

51
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,180
Generator models.

52
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,800
AI creates novel molecules for
specific therapeutic purposes.

53
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,540
CICD in platform engineering.

54
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,540
So you, we can use, CICD principles.

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,590
Platform engineering will automate
the deployment of AI models.

56
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:30,785
Ensuring that every iteration
or improvement is quickly

57
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,405
tested and integrated.

58
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:38,125
This will speed up the time between model
training, testing, deployment, reducing

59
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,915
any downtime, and manual intervention.

60
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:42,415
Case study.

61
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:45,235

Essentia and Sumitomo Genepon
Pharma, AI created a molecule

63
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:54,455
for immuno oncology, reducing the
development time to just eight months.

64
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:58,015
Enter clinical trials faster
than traditional timelines.

65
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,710
Typically, 4 to 5 years highlights
AI's ability to expedite the

66
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,980
discovery process, faster time to
market with platform engineering.

67
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,700
