00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,240
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,100
My name is Natalia, and today we're
gonna be talking about privacy in

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,110
particular, how to build infrastructure
and products, perhaps some company

4
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,240
processes with privacy in mind.

5
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:28,535
A

6
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:32,115
couple of words about me.

7
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:36,515
I'm a software engineer with over
10 years of overall experience.

8
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:42,184
The last three years of which I've
been working in privacy in big tech.

9
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:44,315
And what I've noticed is

10
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:52,035
that privacy is a highly ambiguous and
extensive domain with lots of terms and

11
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:55,905
abbreviations and people get lost in it.

12
00:00:56,645 --> 00:01:02,495
Therefore, I'm hoping to bring a
little bit of clarity around the topic.

13
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:09,130
And give a high level overview
of the scope and its relation to

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,210
infrastructure and platform engineering.

15
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,520
And hopefully in a way that
doesn't make you fall asleep.

16
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:21,429
Now a little bit around the motivation.

17
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,210
Why do we want to care about privacy?

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,510
First we want to have
high ethical standards.

19
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,790
We also want to build as well as
maintain user trust and therefore

20
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,350
care for our reputation as a company.

21
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,370
And lastly, we don't want to have
any problems with the regulators.

22
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:50,625
and regulations, talking about which
regulations are taking over the world.

23
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:56,045
And it's becoming more challenging
to find a country with, without

24
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:58,525
data protection laws in place.

25
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:03,655
On this picture, I highlighted
only the main regulations,

26
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:04,874
something I'm familiar with.

27
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,340
But I'm sure there are a lot more
and the central regulation is GDPR.

28
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,460
I'm sure you've heard of it And most of
other countries get inspired by it when

29
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:22,335
producing their own data protection laws
Therefore by making sure you are GDPR

30
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:27,795
compliant, you automatically get compliant
with most of the other regulations.

31
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:33,085
Not all of them, some countries are a
little bit more special, for example,

32
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:36,015
the US with its Federal Trade Commission.

33
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:41,665
But still, GDPR is a good
reference point for compliance.

34
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:49,630
Now, When I say privacy, most people
usually hear Signal, Secret Shots,

35
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,620
Onion Network, Blockchain, etc.

36
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,840
And even my friends who work in
tech but are out of the privacy

37
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:00,820
domain, they think I work on end to
end encryption, making sure people

38
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,629
have private means of communication.

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,084
And it's funny because I wish they
knew how different my work is.

40
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:09,455
Actually is.

41
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:11,255
It's a lot less cool.

42
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:16,275
But the point I wanted to
make here is that privacy is

43
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,925
so much more than security.

44
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:24,925
And indeed security and encryption and
2N encryption is an aspect of privacy.

45
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,654
But privacy is a lot more.

46
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:31,435
And so far, it's probably been the
most ambiguous and multifaceted

47
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:37,655
domain I've ever worked in due to its
substantial regulatory compliance side.

48
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:43,455
Now, I want to give an overview
of the main principles to give

49
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:45,455
you an idea of what the scope is.

50
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:50,335
And I tried to make it as short as
possible so you guys don't get bored.

51
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:53,675
But bear with me here, this is important.

52
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:55,465
The privacy principles.

53
00:03:56,715 --> 00:04:02,655
The user personal data that you collect
has to be protected from unauthorized

54
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:06,365
access, theft, loss of damage, right?

55
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:10,665
Now, you also as a company,
organization, you want to be

56
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:15,014
transparent with the user about what
data you collect, what people collect.

57
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:20,325
purpose you collected for, who
you perhaps shared with, how long

58
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:21,535
you're going to retain it for.

59
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:27,315
Those annoying privacy notices
that you often see, this is

60
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:30,375
about the transparency principle.

61
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:34,415
Lots of people find them annoying, but
this is something that is required by law.

62
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:41,465
Now, the user should have a means to
access their personal data, perhaps

63
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:44,935
modify it, opt out for some parts.

64
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:49,925
And delete it all together, which
is the right to be forgotten.

65
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:56,365
The user has to have a simple
means of deleting all of their

66
00:04:56,415 --> 00:04:59,335
personal data at your system.

67
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:01,805
Now, this is not all.

68
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:04,395
I have a couple of more
to you, for you guys.

69
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:11,285
Data minimization is about Collecting
only the necessary data needed for your

70
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:14,385
functional functionality to function.

71
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:17,495
You can't repurpose the data.

72
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,925
So let's say you collected user
emails for registration purposes.

73
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:28,205
You can't later use it for
analytics, for example, or for

74
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:31,245
marketing without the user consent.

75
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:36,855
Yeah, purpose limitation is
about not repurposing the data.

76
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:42,445
Now, there has to be a defined
period of time you are supposed

77
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:44,425
to retain the data for.

78
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:48,815
GDPR, for example, doesn't have
a specific retention period.

79
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:52,915
You have to come up with it for
yourself, as long as it's defined.

80
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,945
And you shouldn't store
data longer than that.

81
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,930
And finally, accountability as
an organization, you are held

82
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,710
responsible for adhering to the privacy
regulations, and you must be able to

83
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,200
demonstrate compliance upon request.

84
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,030
So these are the main
principles, but not all of them.

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,310
I haven't touched on some of the
aspects like data sharing, and

86
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,830
I'm sure there are a few details
I have, I might've missed here.

87
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,140
However, that's the general idea and I
hope the scope is more or less clear.

88
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,150
So now we can talk about infrastructure.

89
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,710
So we want to build
infrastructure with privacy layer.

90
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,020
How do we do that?

91
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,550
So it's helpful to think about it,
visualizing three main components.

92
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:51,030
We have our regulations and commitments,
which are often translated to policies.

93
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:58,250
We have our data and we have
infrastructure and product code, and

94
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:04,110
they interact with one another in such a
way where the data gets associated with.

95
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:11,815
a set of policies, then your code is
aware of what kind of data it processes.

96
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:16,475
It recognizes what data is
sensitive and it is aware of

97
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:19,475
policies and is able to enforce it.

98
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:20,975
Hopefully it makes sense.

99
00:07:21,385 --> 00:07:25,005
I'll make a little bit of a pause
here to make sure it's digested

100
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:32,295
and we can talk about each of
these components in more detail.

101
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,805
So regulations and commitments.

102
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,810
We know what a regulation is, right?

103
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,760
Something that is defined, a
rule defined by regulators.

104
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,130
Whereas a commitment is
something a company chooses

105
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,420
to come up with themselves.

106
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:57,430
For example, WhatsApp positions itself
as an end to end encryption messenger.

107
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,230
So end to end encryption
is not required by law.

108
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,210
But it's a commitment and the law
requires what's up to stick to it.

109
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,290
So we have our regulations, we might
have some additional commitments, and

110
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,660
they are translated into policies.

111
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,330
A policy consists of three things.

112
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:23,000
It has a scope, meaning the geographical,
Every way it applies, it has its

113
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,660
enforcement logic, and it has a way
to get associated with the data.

114
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,190
Just a couple of examples here
to make sure it's clear what

115
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,420
policy is for example, email
shouldn't be used for marketing.

116
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:39,995
purposes without consent in the EU.

117
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:45,985
It has its geographical tag, it's got the
data element site, and it's got logic.

118
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:48,905
Retention policy is
something I took from the US.

119
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:52,695
The bank statements can't be
retained for longer than seven years.

120
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,975
It's also a good example of a policy.

121
00:08:56,635 --> 00:09:02,765
Once we have our policies, well
defined and established, we can

122
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:05,125
talk about data understanding.

123
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:08,205
So data understanding is crucial.

124
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:12,215
Usually it consists of
approximately the following steps.

125
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:18,220
So first would be categorizing your
data and defining what of the data that

126
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:24,800
you process is sensitive and register
registering it in one and another way.

127
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:30,620
Usually it gets registered as a set of
annotations centrally or taxonomy and

128
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,155
when you have that you can annotate your
data throughout your infrastructure,

129
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:43,475
usually at the API levels, your data
transfer objects, data base schemas, any

130
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:46,995
data sync that you have can be annotated.

131
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:52,815
So this is quite helpful to
track where the data is stored

132
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:55,305
and where it travels through.

133
00:09:56,405 --> 00:10:00,745
And an advanced step would be building
something called data lineage.

134
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,590
And data lineage is a way to
track the life cycle of the

135
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,880
data across the infrastructure.

136
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,850
Ideally, we want to pick a data element,
let's say an email in this case, and

137
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,330
we want to see a graph showing how
it travels to our platform, where it

138
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,808
comes in what elements it comes to.

139
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:26,778
goes through and where does it end up?

140
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:32,528
This is a powerful tool that helps
you to gain a lot of control over

141
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:38,048
your data, but also you can build
a lot of things on top of that.

142
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:44,848
Particularly, you can build a continuous
compliance automated breach detection.

143
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:52,138
For example, you can continuously verify
that Some of the data parts do not end

144
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:57,348
up where they're not supposed to end
up, or not retained for longer than

145
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:59,088
they're supposed to be retained for.

146
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:07,838
And also you can generate some
evidence for the regulatory compliance.

147
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:13,428
There are some solutions out there
that you can use for data lineage,

148
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:14,938
but you can also build it yourself.

149
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:20,558
Something like production sampling,
dynamic analysis or instrumentation

150
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:26,878
might be used data probing, and even
static analysis can be used for at least

151
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:29,358
complementing your data lineage graph.

152
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:31,038
Okay.

153
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,308
So a little bit on the
infrastructure and code.

154
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:42,238
So it integrates our policies in a
way where it knows how to associate

155
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:48,738
sensitive data with a set of policies
often propagating policy context with

156
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:54,178
your data is really helpful if you
have context propagation in place.

157
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:59,578
If your policy or set of policies
can travel through the invocation

158
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:05,508
tree of your code with the data,
that would be really helpful.

159
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:10,643
And finally, when the data reaches its
destination point or some other points

160
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:14,253
the policy can be enforced by the code.

161
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:17,153
All right.

162
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:20,883
So hopefully that was more or less clear.

163
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:25,193
And now I want to talk a little bit
about the practices that are out

164
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:31,293
there that help us to prevent privacy
incidents and protect user data.

165
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:37,063
So some of the Practices are
relatively straight forward, and you

166
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:38,593
probably already have them in place.

167
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:44,503
Something like access control for
security that ensures that our data

168
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,813
is protected from unauthorized access.

169
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:54,228
Encryption makes sure that our data is
protected in case of unauthorized access.

170
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:58,908
Some additional practices like
anonymization, sorry, I have

171
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:00,258
always trouble pronouncing it.

172
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:07,198
Anonymization, you can modify your
data before sharing it either with

173
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:11,178
a third party company or with,
let's say, your analytics level.

174
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:15,118
Lots of other people throughout
the company has access to it.

175
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:17,448
You can anonymize it.

176
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:21,488
Delete the purpose, personally
identifiable information.

177
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:25,848
Let's say, delete or replace
user IDs by a replacement ID.

178
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:31,828
You can store this map, mappings
between ID and replacement ID, somewhere

179
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:34,028
separate on the separate security layer.

180
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:37,848
So the data can't be
tracked back to your user.

181
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:45,178
Now, data coarsening is about
reducing the granularity of your data.

182
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:50,608
Let's say you have a geographical location
of a user, and perhaps you don't need

183
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:52,988
the precise location for analytics.

184
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:57,443
Maybe you can make it
approximate, and Then analyze it.

185
00:13:57,763 --> 00:14:04,213
So that could also help to reduce
some of the privacy incidents, some

186
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:08,623
of the organizational measures that
you can have in place for privacy.

187
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:13,583
As I mentioned before, having
well-defined privacy policies in

188
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,118
your company is really important.

189
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:19,993
Have them documented
and very well defined.

190
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,173
And once you have that, you
can train your employees.

191
00:14:24,268 --> 00:14:28,858
To make sure they are aware of the privacy
policies they are aware of the privacy

192
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:34,678
regulations, the principles, and they can
build your product keeping that in mind.

193
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:38,138
Some of the processes like privacy
reviews, let's say you release a

194
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:43,148
feature and you want to make sure
double check that it's privacy

195
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:49,928
compliant, it can be verified by
another team for privacy policies.

196
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:53,728
And regular risk assessments
and compliance audits.

197
00:14:54,648 --> 00:15:02,858
but also help to maybe identify some
vulnerabilities in your system and also

198
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:06,558
reduce the risk of a privacy incident.

199
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:12,578
And I want to also say a couple
of words on continuous compliance.

200
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:18,148
One thing is to be compliant when you
say you launch a product or release

201
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:22,968
a feature, but staying compliant is
a little bit of a different thing.

202
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:24,118
Thank you.

203
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:30,588
Especially as the company grows bigger,
things tend to get out of control and

204
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:36,118
having continuous compliance becomes
more and more useful, automated.

205
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:41,128
Breach detection is about having
a set of processes in place.

206
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:50,508
Let's say some regular verification jobs
that make sure that the data is still

207
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:53,418
compliant against your set of policies.

208
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:59,098
And if there is a breach that is
found, you can raise an incident.

209
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:03,528
It can be something as simple as
an email or something a little bit

210
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:05,098
more complicated, like I don't know.

211
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:11,323
Setting a fire alarm filing a
task, and yeah, as long, it can be

212
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:12,723
anything as long as it's addressed.

213
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:20,123
Yeah, so hopefully I still have
your attention guys, and there

214
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:22,153
are just a couple of slides left.

215
00:16:23,423 --> 00:16:28,013
And now I want to talk about privacy
investments that you can do today

216
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:30,803
in order to avoid a headache.

217
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:36,418
So I decided to break
it down by company size.

218
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:38,118
So there is a scale here.

219
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:43,608
It goes from a startup to big tech, and
depending where you are on the scale,

220
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:47,338
you might choose to do different things.

221
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:50,768
So let's say you're a startup, right?

222
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,558
Early stages of development.

223
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:53,758
Things are uncertain.

224
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:56,648
No Time to think about privacy.

225
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,528
Probably the last thing you
want to think about is privacy.

226
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,158
And I totally understand that.

227
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:07,178
So a couple of foundational things that
you can do that are not necessarily

228
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:11,968
privacy related, but they can help
you to reduce the privacy headache.

229
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:20,663
So context propagation, I highly recommend
that it is really useful, not only for

230
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:25,673
privacy, but for a number of other things
particularly logging and debugging,

231
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:31,003
but also having a sense of control
around what's going on in your system.

232
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:35,143
But then on top of that, you
can do privacy propagation too.

233
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:44,858
So distributed Tracing is making sure
that Your context is propagated from

234
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:47,598
a service to a service and beyond.

235
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:52,488
Having distributed tracing, make sure
you have your context propagation

236
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:53,908
across the whole entire system.

237
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:58,593
Also, at this point, you can
implement something basic

238
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:00,133
as constant implementation.

239
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:03,233
It wouldn't take too much,
so why not doing that?

240
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:08,323
And having basic security means
encryption, access control,

241
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:09,863
and perhaps something else.

242
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:13,313
But also, not hurt, at least.

243
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:20,213
So let's say you're a growing company
now, you've got more users, more data,

244
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:25,223
more employees coming in and out, and
things are getting serious at this

245
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:28,283
point, and inevitably more hectic.

246
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:34,833
So this is a good time to have your
privacy policies already established.

247
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:41,833
And again, once you have that, you can
train your employees to make sure they are

248
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:49,953
aware of what privacy is and how to make
sure the product they built is compliant.

249
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:55,593
So understanding and categorizing
your data is really helpful.

250
00:18:55,863 --> 00:19:01,503
Here, too, at this point, you
can annotate your data on top

251
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,523
of the context provocation that
we hopefully previously built.

252
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:12,393
We can do policy propagation and already
start implementing some policy enforcement

253
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:21,043
logic once the data and the set of
policies reaches a certain point right.

254
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:24,948
Now, you are a bigger company now.

255
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:29,128
In fact, you're huge and
you've got even more users.

256
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:35,858
Tremendous amount of users, more data,
more employees, and things might be even

257
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:37,968
getting out of control at this point.

258
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:42,983
And because it's becoming more
difficult to keep track of things.

259
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:48,643
So at this point, you're also an
easier target to the regulator.

260
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:53,043
So one day they can, they are more
likely to knock on the door one

261
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:58,723
day, because you have more impact
on users and society in general.

262
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:03,628
So data lineage It's probably a good idea.

263
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:09,678
And it would help you to, sorry,
this is my cat making noise.

264
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:12,818
It would help you to keep track of things.

265
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:17,358
Continuous compliance, automated
breach detection and automatic

266
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:23,608
evidence generation is probably, would
also probably be helpful here too.

267
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,308
And of course, a regular risk
assessments, compliance audits.

268
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:35,748
audits would also help to reduce
the risks of privacy incidents

269
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,308
to a significant extent.

270
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:42,778
So this is the end of my slides.

271
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:49,948
If you take away from you guys, privacy
is something that benefits from investing

272
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:52,178
early in pretty much like everything else,

273
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:59,908
but still privacy, especially,
and understanding and categorizing

274
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:07,743
your data would help, Keeps things
structured and having well defined

275
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:12,283
established policies would also
provide a significant advantage.

276
00:21:13,843 --> 00:21:14,853
Thank you very much.

277
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:21,123
I hope that was clear and somewhat
useful, and I hope to see you next time.

278
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:21,923
Bye.
