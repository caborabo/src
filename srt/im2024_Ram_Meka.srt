00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,780
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,070
I'm Ram, a principal systems developer
with over 10 years of experience

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,119
in building health care products,
particularly in kidney care.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,140
Thank you for joining me today.

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,649
I'm excited to explore artificial
intelligence in incident management for

6
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:19,409
dialysis health care, optimizing the
response and reducing the system failures.

7
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,279
of the dialysis health care landscape.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,919
The prevalence.

9
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:26,909
Dialysis is a critical treatment
for millions of individuals

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:27,929
suffering from kidney failure.

11
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:32,179
A condition that is becoming
increasingly common due to rising

12
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:35,190
rates of chronic diseases such
as diabetes and hypertension.

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,860
The World Health Organization
estimates that over 2 million

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,399
people globally are on dialysis.

15
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:43,940
A number that is expected to
grow as these underlying health

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,209
issues become more prevalent.

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,289
This trend emphasizes the urgent
need for the effective kidney

18
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:51,949
care and management strategies.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,039
Coming to the types of dialysis, there
are two primary types of dialysis.

20
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:58,920
The first one being hemodialysis.

21
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:03,119
This method involves filtering the
blood through a machine called dialyzer.

22
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,735
which acts as an, artificial kidney.

23
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:09,935
Blood is drawn from the body,
cleaned, and then returned.

24
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:14,185
Hemodialysis typically occurs in
a clinical setting, which, with

25
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:18,424
sessions lasting about three to
five hours, several times a week.

26
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:21,504
The second one, the peritoneal dialysis.

27
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:26,135
In this method, the, the abdominal
line, lining, also known, known as

28
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:28,985
peritoneum, is used as a neural filter.

29
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:33,350
A dialysis solution is introduced
into the abdominal cavity, where

30
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,509
it absorbs waste products from
the blood through the peritoneum.

31
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:42,050
This type can be done at home and offers
greater flexibility in terms of schedule.

32
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,629
The settings, the dialysis can
be performed in various settings.

33
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,720
some of them could be hospitals, often the
primary location for patients requiring

34
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,199
the acute care or those starting dialysis.

35
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:58,699
Dedicated dialysis centers,
specialized facilities that offer a

36
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:02,169
range of dialysis services typically
staffed by trained professionals.

37
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:03,745
at the home.

38
00:02:03,964 --> 00:02:08,844
An increasing number of patients
are opting for the home dialysis,

39
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:13,634
which allows for more independence
and can improve the quality of life.

40
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:18,304
Home dialysis options, especially
peritoneal dialysis, enable

41
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,024
patients to manage their treatment
in a familiar environment.

42
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,615
Coming to the cost, the financial burden
of the dialysis can be significant.

43
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:30,075
Treatment can be costly with
expenses related to equipment,

44
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:31,745
supplies, and healthcare personnel.

45
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:34,834
Many patients rely on
government healthcare programs

46
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:36,104
such as Medicare in the U.

47
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:36,384
S.

48
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:39,294
or private instances to cover these costs.

49
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:43,925
However, the financial implications can
still be overwhelming, particularly for

50
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,935
those without the adequate coverage.

51
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:50,964
The importance of effective
incident management in patient care.

52
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:54,374
These would cover the patient safety.

53
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,974
Effective incident management
is crucial for maintaining

54
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:58,304
patient safety in dialysis care.

55
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:02,635
Rapidly identifying and addressing
errors or near misses helps to

56
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:04,584
prevent harm for the patients.

57
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:09,415
For example, timely interventions can
prevent complications related to dialysis

58
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:11,995
exercises or machine malfunctions.

59
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,599
Ensuring that patients receive
safe and effective treatment.

60
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:18,599
Quality Improvement.

61
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:22,369
Analyzing incidents that occur
during dialysis treatments is

62
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,010
vital for identifying systematic
issues within healthcare practices.

63
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,999
By examining these incidents,
healthcare providers can implement

64
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:34,789
strategies to improve process, enhance
training for staff, and establish

65
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,739
protocols that manage and minimize
the risk of future occurrences.

66
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:42,779
This focus on continuous improvement
ultimately leads to better

67
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,779
patient outcomes and increased
trust in the healthcare services.

68
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:51,500
Moving to the risk mitigation, proper
incident management not only enhances

69
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,329
patient safety but also reduces liability
and potential legal consequences.

70
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,230
For health care providers, by having
robust procedures in place for reporting

71
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,750
and managing incidents, facilities can
demonstrate their commitment to quality

72
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,029
care, which may help in mitigating the
risks associated with the malpractice

73
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:13,070
of claims or regulatory scrutiny.

74
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:18,479
Effective risk management fosters a
culture of safety and accountability,

75
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,839
benefiting both patients and
the health care professionals.

76
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:25,135
Understanding the incident management.

77
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:29,974
Incident management in healthcare is a
critical process designed to enhance the

78
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:32,645
patient's safety and the care quality.

79
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:37,195
It involves a systematic approach to
identifying, reporting, analyzing,

80
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:39,844
and responding to the adverse events.

81
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:44,025
The near misses are unexpected
occurrences that can impact

82
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:46,055
patients or the healthcare system.

83
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:49,695
By establishing a robust
incident management framework,

84
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:53,584
healthcare organizations can
improve outcomes, minimize risk,

85
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,934
and foster a culture of safety.

86
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:01,135
Coming on to the incident management
process itself, the incident

87
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:03,605
management process typically
includes several key steps.

88
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:06,385
Some of them could be the detection
and reporting of the incidents.

89
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:10,284
Talking about the detection, the
first step involves recognizing

90
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:11,555
when an incident occurs.

91
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:13,755
Or is it about to occur?

92
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,965
This can be achieved through
monitoring systems, the staff

93
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:18,855
observations, or patient feedback.

94
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:20,924
And then the reporting.

95
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:24,854
Once detected, incidents should be
primarily said to be promptly reported.

96
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:28,694
Many organizations utilize standardized
reporting systems or electronic

97
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:32,825
tools that allow staff to document
incidents easily and confidentially.

98
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:39,125
Encouraging a culture of transparency and
non productive, non punitive reporting is

99
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,495
essential to capture all relevant events.

100
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:44,424
The initial assessment and prioritization.

101
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:50,260
After an assessment is reported, it
undergoes an initial assessment to

102
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,820
determine its severity and impact
on patient safety and care quality.

103
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:59,429
These steps involved classifying incidents
based on their potential or actual

104
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:06,584
consequences, enabling prioritization
Investigating the root cause analysis.

105
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:11,704
A thorough investigation follows,
involving a detailed examination

106
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:15,544
of the incident to gather facts
and understand what happened.

107
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:19,064
This may include reviewing the
patient records, interviewing

108
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:20,424
staff, and analyzing the workflows.

109
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,219
Coming to the actual root cause analysis,
the investigation aims to identify

110
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,570
the underlying the underlying causes
of incident incident rather than just

111
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,060
addressing the surface level issues.

112
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:37,320
RCA techniques such as the five wives
or the fishbone diagram help teams to

113
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,230
uncover systematic factors contributing
to the event, enabling them to tackle

114
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,410
root cause, root causes effectively.

115
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,140
The implementation of corrective actions.

116
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,399
Based on findings from the investigation,
corrective actions are developed and

117
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,699
implemented to prevent recurrence.

118
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:57,640
These actions might include the
policy changes, staff training,

119
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,740
process redesign, or enhancements
to equipment or technology.

120
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,229
The goal is to create
sustainable environment in

121
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,760
practices and the protocols.

122
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,280
Monitoring and the evaluation of outcomes.

123
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,849
After corrective actions are
implemented, it's crucial to monitor

124
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,079
their effectiveness over time.

125
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:19,319
This involves the tracking of
outcomes and analyzing whether

126
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,759
the changes have resulted in a
reduction in similar incidents.

127
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,900
Ongoing evaluation ensures that the
improvements are embedded within

128
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,770
the organization and that any new
issues are promptly addressed.

129
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,159
Sharing of lessons learned.

130
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:37,399
One of the most important aspects of
incident management is the dissemination

131
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,979
of lessons learned from each incident.

132
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,009
Sharing insights across the
teams and departments fosters a

133
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:46,379
culture of continuous learning.

134
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:52,155
This can be accomplished through regular
meetings, training sessions, Newsletters,

135
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:55,485
ensuring that all staff members are
aware of findings and best practices.

136
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,429
The key components of incident management.

137
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:02,900
So the incident management process can
be broken into four key components.

138
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,939
That are the detection, reporting,
and response, and then the recovery

139
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,950
from what we discussed above.

140
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,079
The current challenges
in dialysis healthcare.

141
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,519
The dialysis healthcare landscape
faces several pressing challenges

142
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:24,060
that impact the patient safety, care
quality, and operational efficiency.

143
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,750
Among these, high patient volumes
and increasing complexity of cases

144
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,030
are particularly significant.

145
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:34,755
So discussing the high patient
volumes and complexity in detail,

146
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:37,525
the overcrowding, overcrowding.

147
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:41,575
So in many healthcare settings,
especially hospitals and emergency

148
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:44,684
departments, there is often an influx
of patients requiring dialysis.

149
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:48,924
This can lead to overcrowding where
facilities struggle to accommodate the

150
00:08:48,924 --> 00:08:50,414
number of patients needing treatment.

151
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:53,284
Also the long, long time waits.

152
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:57,535
Overcrowding typically results in
an extended wait times for patients,

153
00:08:57,805 --> 00:09:04,065
delay in treatment the existing health
issues leading to worse outcomes and

154
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,515
increased patient dissatisfaction.

155
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,775
Patients may experience anxiety and
frustration due to uncertainty over

156
00:09:09,775 --> 00:09:11,865
their, over their care timelines.

157
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:15,574
Increasing complexity of cases.

158
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:19,955
Many patients undergoing dialysis
have multiple comorbid conditions,

159
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:24,415
such as diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, and other chronic illness.

160
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:27,285
This complexity requires
tailored treatment plans.

161
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,730
and close monitoring, straining
resources, and increasing the

162
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,150
likelihood of complications.

163
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,240
The varying needs.

164
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,290
Each patient situation is unique,
necessitating individualized care.

165
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,630
Healthcare providers must navigate
varying medical histories, medication

166
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,670
interactions, and lifestyle factors,
which can complicate the delivery

167
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,570
of consistent and effective care.

168
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,940
The frequent equipment failure
and patient complications.

169
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,900
Critical devices used in the dialysis,
such as the dialysis machines, infusion

170
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,850
pumps, and monitoring equipment
may be more prone to malfunction

171
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,970
in busy healthcare environments.

172
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,009
Increased usage can lead to
wear and tear, making equipment

173
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,940
reliability a crucial concern.

174
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,500
So the heavy demand placed on the
dialysis equipment can disrupt

175
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,840
regular maintenance schedules.

176
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,170
When maintenance is deferred or
inadequately performed due to high

177
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,260
patient volumes, the likelihood
of equipment breakdowns increases,

178
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,080
potentially compromising the patient care.

00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:44,954
common applications in healthcare.

299
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:50,715
So some of the features could be the
data collection, the feature selection,

300
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:53,315
model training, model validation.

301
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,120
let's talk about some of the examples of
the predictive models used in healthcare,

302
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,345
which are readmission, risk prediction,
or the sepsis prediction, chronic disease

303
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:13,699
progression, medical adherence, and
the emergency department utilizations.

304
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,100
on to the real time monitoring
technologies in dialysis.

305
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,439
The integration of sensors and the
IOT, Internet of Things, devices in

306
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,039
dialysis has transformed the management
and delivery of this critical treatment

307
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:33,470

308
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,090
These technologies not only enhance
the efficacy of dialysis, but also

309
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,950
improve patient safety and optimize
the overall treatment process.

310
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,990
Here is a detailed overview of three
key real time monitoring technologies

311
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:50,709
in dialysis, which are the overview
of sensors and IOT, IOT devices.

312
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,370
in dialysis, which helps in,
the fluid balance sensors,

313
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:00,300
bioimpedance sensors, or clinical
applications, or the weight sensors.

314
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,980
And then the next one could be the
dialysate, dialysate composite,

315
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,450
composition sensors, which helps
in, the conductivity sensors

316

allow for immediate identification
of potential complications.

322
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,730
And then, we could also detect the rapid
fluid shifts and the blood pressure

323
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,870
changes and also the electrolyte balances,
which helps in the proactive intervention.

324
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,840
The ability to monitor patients in real
time allows healthcare teams to intervene

325
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,900
proactively before complications escalate.

326

Early identification of issues enable
timely adjustments to treatment

327
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,260
plans, medication administration,
and the other interventions.

328
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,070
So let's.

329
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,880
To look at a case study for, the
predictive analytics and, action.

330
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,605
So let's take the example

help in the data collection, predictive

342
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:03,996
analytics model development, development
and real time, sorry, the deployment

343
00:22:03,996 --> 00:22:09,150
and real time monitoring, And then from
all of this, whatever the results we

344
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,610
get and the benefits that could include
reduction in equipment failure, improved

345
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,760
treatment continuity, enhanced patient
safety and operational efficiency.

346
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,780
Automated incident reporting.

347
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,280
Automated incident reporting is a
transformative approach in healthcare

348
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,480
that leverages artificial intelligence
to streamline the documentation

349
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,320
process for adverse events, near
misses, and other clinical events.

350
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,730
This automation not only enhances
efficiency, but also improves

351
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,430
accuracy and compliance in reporting.

352
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:45,445
Here is a detailed look at how
AI can automate clinical incident

353
00:22:46,085 --> 00:22:49,755
documentation through real time data
capture and intelligent form filling.

354
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:54,875
So some of them could be, the real time
data capture, which can be achieved

355
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:58,615
through continuous monitoring of the
medical devices, the patient vital

356
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:00,755
signs, and the environmental factors.

357
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:04,325
And then the automated data collection.

358
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:08,275
When an incident occurs, the AI
system automatically captures the

359
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:11,625
relevant data points at the exact
time of event, which could include

360
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:16,385
the time and date of the incident,
specific reading from the medical

361
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:19,225
devices, environmental conditions, etc.

362
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:23,695
With that, the benefits of real
time data capture could include

363
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:25,115
the immediate documentation.

364
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:30,385
where, where the, where it provides
the ability to capture the data at that

365
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:33,925
data at the moment and incident occur
ensures that, critical information is

366
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:37,695
not lost or forgotten, which improves
the readability of the reports.

367
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:41,495
And also it helps in the
comprehensive insight by collecting

368
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:43,025
the data from multiple resources.

369
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:46,305
The AI provides holistic
view of the incident, helping

370
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:47,955
to identify, contributing.

371
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,040
Factors and the trends.

372
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,140
It also helps in the reduction of
the reduced burden on the staff.

373
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,740
Automating the data collection process
alleviates the documentation workload

374
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,660
on healthcare professionals, allowing
them to focus on the patient care.

375
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,730
And then also we, the other key feature
could be the intelligent form filling,

376
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,760
where we are, we could take the advantage
of natural language processing, which

377
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,580
helps in the transcription of the voice
notes, The automatic for population of

378
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,240
the standardized forms and filling out
the required fields that are needed for

379
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,500
the treatment and the benefits of the
intelligent form filling could include

380
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:32,730
the enhanced accuracy and then the time
efficiency which saves a lot of time and

381
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,380
then the streamlined reporting process.

382
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,470
So basically automating, automated
reporting facilitates, quicker analysis

383
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,020
and review of the incidents, helping
the organizations to identify trends

384
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,870
and implement current, corrective
actions more, more effectively.

385
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,620
The benefits of AI in
Dialysis Incident Management.

386
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:55,700
The integration of AI in Dialysis,
Incident Management significantly enhances

387
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,250
patient safety, care quality, operational
efficiency, and resource allocation.

388
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:05,265
So here, let's explore, some of
the benefits focusing on early

389
00:25:05,265 --> 00:25:07,675
detection and prevention as
well as optimized scheduling.

390
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:12,705
So enhanced patient safety
and care quality, which could

391
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:15,975
cover the early detection and
prevention through the continuous

392
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:18,701
monitoring and predictive alerts.

393
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:22,655
Let's take a look at the example.

394
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:28,395
In a personal, in a practical scenario,
an AI system detects subtle changes

395
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,485
in a patient's blood pressure trend.

396
00:25:31,175 --> 00:25:35,425
During a dialysis session, it can
generate an alert for the healthcare team.

397
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:40,525
This proactive measure allows the staff
to intervene early, adjusting fluid

398
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:45,585
removal rates, or providing necessary
medication before a hypertensive

399
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:50,715
episode occurs, thereby preventing
complications and ensuring patient safety.

400
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:55,455
Moving on to the improved operational
efficiency and resource allocation.

401
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,100
It helps in optimizing scheduling based
on a dynamic schedule instead of a

402
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,740
static scheduling and resource matching.

403
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,240
We don't need to do a
manual resource matching.

404
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,200
AI could take take care of
doing that resource matching.

405
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,720
So that also helps.

406
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,330
So, for example, if you take an
instance, where a patient is known to

407
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,530
require longer treatment times due to
complications or unique medical needs, the

408
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,820
AI systems can dynamically schedule their
appointment to a less busy time slot.

409
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,580
This adjustment not only minimizes wait
times for all patients, but also improves

410
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,240
overall patient flow and satisfaction.

411
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:38,725
on to the implementation
considerations for AI in healthcare.

412
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:43,045
When integrating AI into healthcare
systems, particularly in sensitive

413
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:47,235
areas like dialysis management, several
critical considerations must be addressed.

414
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:51,765
Among these, data privacy and security
issues, as well as integration challenges

415
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:54,355
with existing systems are paramount.

416
00:26:55,185 --> 00:27:00,075
Below is an elaboration on
these key considerations.

417
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:04,780
Some of them could be patient, like
as we talked, the data privacy and

418
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,920
security issues, which could cover the
patient data protection, where we need

419
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,470
to follow the, the HIPAA compliance.

420
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,870
And then, this could, include
implementing policies and procedures

421
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,710
that ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and, the availability

422
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,170
of protected health information.

423
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,410
And then the data encryption, implementing
end to end, end to end encryption is

424
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,690
critical for predicting patient's data.

425
00:27:30,785 --> 00:27:32,825
both in transit and also at rest.

426
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:37,495
This means that data is encrypted
before it is transmitted over

427
00:27:37,495 --> 00:27:41,085
networks and remains encrypted
while stored on the servers.

428
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:46,515
The Access Control Establishing strict
role based access controls to the RBAC,

429
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:50,235
which is commonly known as RBAC, is
vital for limiting the data exposure.

430
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:53,545
RBAC ensures that only authorized
personnel can access the

431
00:27:53,545 --> 00:27:57,015
specific data based on their
job roles and responsibilities.

432
00:27:58,505 --> 00:28:02,850
Moving on to the integration challenges
with the existing systems, One of them

433
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,730
could be the interoperability issues
where we could, one of the significant,

434
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,230
the data format standardization, right?

435
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,220
One of the significant challenges in
implementing AI healthcare is ensuring

436
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,120
that the new system can effectively
interpret and utilize the data from

437
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,920
various existing healthcare IT systems.

438
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,100
Many legacy systems may use
different data formats, making it

439
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,240
difficult for AI applications to
process information seamlessly.

440
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,000
The other could be the API development.

441
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:33,585
We're, developing robust application,
programming interfaces, which are also

442
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:37,885
commonly known as APIs, is essentially
for, is essential for isolating seamless

443
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:42,515
data and hence between, exchange between,
the new AI systems and legacy platforms.

444
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:48,355
API serves as a bridge that enable
different software applications to

445
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:53,205
communicate with each other, allowing
for the faster transfer of data

446
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:54,705
without significant disruptions.

447
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,680
on to addressing the ethical concerns
in AI development, the development of

448
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,720
artificial intelligence in healthcare,
particularly in sensitive areas

449
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,220
like dialysis management, raises
several ethical considerations.

450
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,620
These concerns primarily revolve around
patient autonomy, informed consent,

451
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,300
access, and the potential
for bias in AI algorithms.

452
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:25,110
Addressing these issues is critical
in building trust and ensuring that AI

453
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,020
technologies enhance Patient care without
compromising the ethical standards.

454
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:34,545
Talking about the patient autonomy
and informed consent, this could be

455
00:29:34,545 --> 00:29:38,745
achieved through the transparency
and, the opt-out options.

456
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:43,235
And then moving on to the, the
ensuring equitable actions and

457
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:44,945
avoiding bias and AI algorithms.

458
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:50,715
We, here we could, train the AI
with the diverse data sets so there

459
00:29:50,865 --> 00:29:55,445
by, achieving the equitable access
and then also considering their

460
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:57,630
representative sampling the data updates.

461
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:06,610
The future trends in AI
and dialysis healthcare.

462
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:10,810
So AI continues to advance its
applications in healthcare,

463
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,950
particularly in dialysis management,
are becoming increasingly sophisticated.

464
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,000
One of the most promising areas
is natural language processing.

465
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,160
Which focuses on interaction
between computers and human

466
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,220
through the natural language.

467
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,390
So this could be considered as one
of the emerging technologies, which

468
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,040
is the natural language processing.

469
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,730
It is a rapidly evolving, it is a
rapidly evolving branch of AI that

470
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,270
allows computers to understand,
interpret and generate human language.

471
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,460
Its significance in healthcare lies in
enhancing the communication, improving

472
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,470
the documentation and processes.

473
00:30:46,775 --> 00:30:54,945
The key advancements in NLP lately are
the improved semantic understanding.

474
00:30:55,665 --> 00:31:02,185
The multilingual capabilities is another
big improvement in this area lately.

475
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:06,795
So, coming to the applications
in the incident management.

476
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,920
the natural language processing
capabilities are particularly

477
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,350
beneficial in incident management
within the dialysis healthcare, where

478
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:20,160
timely and accurate documentation can
significantly impact the patient outcomes.

479
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:25,245
Some of them could include the
automated documentation, clinical

480
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:29,915
load analysis, the patient complaint,
and the patient complaint processing.

481
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:36,515
Moving on to the collaborative AI systems,
the integration of AI into healthcare,

482
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:42,375
particularly in dialysis, necessitates
the formation of collaborative AI systems.

483
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:46,359
These systems leverage the expertise
of interdisciplinary teams to maximize

484
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,274
the effectiveness of AI technologies.

485
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,103
These systems leverage the expertise
of interdisciplinary teams to maximize

486
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:50,275
the effectiveness of AI technologies.

487
00:31:51,665 --> 00:31:56,675
Here is some details where
the collaboration could help.

488
00:31:57,605 --> 00:32:03,425
the first one being the diverse
expertise integration, where we go

489
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:07,655
with a multi faceted approach to
fully utilize the AI capabilities.

490
00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:12,885
It is essential to adapt to a
multi faceted approach that draws

491
00:32:12,885 --> 00:32:14,185
from the various disciplines.

492
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:18,705
The next one could be
the team composition.

493
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,780
Like, we've been, in a healthcare, in
a dialysis healthcare system, we would,

494
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:27,500
could have a team composition with
nephrologists, nurse, technicians, data

495
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,570
scientists, AI specialists, ethicists.

496
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:36,445
And then the IT professionals within
one setting, so which could also help.

497
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:42,395
But if we take an example, in developing
AI and AI driven fluid management systems,

498
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:47,895
Nephrologists can offer insights into
the clinical complications, implications

499
00:32:47,895 --> 00:32:49,815
of fluid balances in dialysis patients.

500
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:55,025
Data scientists would be responsible for
designing the algorithms that predict

501
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:57,625
fluid needs based on the patient data.

502
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,910
While nurses provide feedback on
how the system can integrate, can be

503
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,130
integrated into the daily practice.

504
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,360
This collaboration ensures that the
final product is clinically relevant,

505
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,660
technically robust, and user friendly.

506
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,160
Enhancing the communication and
collaboration among healthcare providers.

507
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:20,930
This could be achieved through
shared understanding or the

508
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,350
common language development.

509
00:33:23,855 --> 00:33:25,885
training sessions, et cetera.

510
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:31,385
Looking at an example, organizing
monthly AI nephrology seminars

511
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,715
can serve as a platform where team
members present on a range of topics.

512
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:39,065
For instance, a data scientist
might explain the basics of machine

513
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:42,065
learning while a nephrologist discuss
the clinical dialysis challenges.

514
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:47,209
Such lessons foster knowledge
sharing, enhance the team cohesion.

515
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,560
and encourage collaborative
problem solving.

516
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,840
With all that, discussed, coming
to the conclusion, as healthcare

517
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,710
systems increasingly adopt artificial
intelligence technologies, the potential

518
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,420
for transformation in, the incident
management becomes, increasingly evident.

519
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,390
AI's capabilities offer profound,
profound improvements in

520
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:12,240
patient safety and care quality,
particularly in areas like dialysis.

521
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,980
Let's take a quick recap of
the transformative potential

522
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,390
of AI in incident management.

523
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,700
The first one being enhanced predictive
capabilities, where we could, achieve

524
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,260
the early detection with the help
of the AI algorithms that analyze

525
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,910
the vast amounts of data and the
risk satisfaction stratification.

526
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:36,955
Advanced modeling techniques allow
for categorization of patients based

527
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:41,035
on their likelihood of experiences,
experiencing complications.

528
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:45,295
This risk strategy stratification
enables health care providers to

529
00:34:45,325 --> 00:34:48,785
tailor monitor and treatment strategies
according to individual patient needs.

530
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,675
And the next one being the
real time monitoring analysis.

531
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:59,570
which could be achieved through continuous
assessment and anomaly detection.

532
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:07,280
Again, with all that, to summarize in
a final thought, the integration of AI

533
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,120
into incident management represents a
paradigm shift in healthcare, offering

534
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,510
enhanced predictive capabilities and
real time monitoring that significantly

535
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,020
improve patient safety and care quality.

536
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:23,460
By leveraging AI's power to detect
early warning signs and analyze data

537
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,470
continuously, healthcare providers can
act proactively rather than reactively,

538
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,290
leading to better patient outcomes and
a more efficient healthcare system.

539
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:37,595
As these technologies continue to
evolve and become more widely adapted,

540
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:44,145
the role in incident management will
likely grow, into a new era of precision

541
00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:46,925
medicine and, the patient centered care.

542
00:35:49,055 --> 00:35:49,635
Thank you.

543
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:53,195
Thank you for your opportunity to
share this information with you.

544
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:58,495
