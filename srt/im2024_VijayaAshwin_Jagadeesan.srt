pandemic, the market was valued about, 96.

12
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:52,014
5 billion US dollars and it is expected
to grow at an compound annual growth

13
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:56,414
rate of 15 percent between 2021 and 28.

14
00:00:57,174 --> 00:01:01,944
This growth is a great evidence that
the technology plays a very important

15
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:07,494
roles in healthcare, especially in the
light of COVID pandemic, which acted

16
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,934
as a main catalyst for these changes.

17
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:15,854
The pandemic paved the way for widespread
adoption of Telehealth services with

18
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:21,054
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention reporting a 154 percent

19
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:25,834
increase in telehealth usage and after
COVID compared to the previous years.

20
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:30,454
So the telemedicine and digital
health solutions are here to say

21
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:34,994
signaling a fundamental shift
in how healthcare is delivered.

22
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,969
And next, let's talk about the role of
artificial intelligence in healthcare.

23
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,539
the AI market in healthcare was
valued around 7 billion US dollars

00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:14,344
These AI systems have reduced
the false positive by 5.

30
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:16,674
7 percent and the false negatives by 9.

31
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:19,664
4 percent in breast cancer detection.

32
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:26,174
And let's see how the, how AI plays a
major role in personalized treatment.

33
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:33,144
So AI analyzes patient data to develop
personalized custom treatment plans.

34
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:38,744
For example, a particular clinic,
the AI guided treatment improved the

35
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:43,524
remission rates for depression by
6%, enhancing the patient outcomes.

36
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,084
So what is the potential?

37
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:51,734
so the AI is creating, is a game
changer in the patient care, by making

beyond just predictions.

62
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:51,584
So these tools assist doctors in making
data driven decisions that optimizes care

63
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,304
and reduce the risk of medical errors.

64
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:58,644
So AI powered clinical decision
support system provide real time

65
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:03,204
recommendations for diagnosis and
treatment, while the natural language

66
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:08,244
processing tools analyze electronic
health records to identify the trends.

67
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:13,319
Helping the clinicians monitor the
treatment outcomes and spot at risk

68
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:19,939
patients Additionally the AI helps
in triaging Emergency room patients

69
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:24,649
by accessing symptoms by assessing
symptoms and prioritizing those in

70
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:29,999
need of immediate care Enhancing the
patient outcomes and reducing wait times

71
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:39,259
and next see let's see the advanced
data analytics in healthcare so

72

optimizing workflows and resource
allocations and reduce cost.

83
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:34,414
For example, a major hospital
successfully utilized predictive

84
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:39,164
analytics to reduce emergency department,
boarding hours by 20%, and increase

85
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:44,444
the early discharge by 21%, which
significantly improved patient flow.

86
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:51,684
Moreover, predictive analysis is, It's
also useful to foresee high risk patients

87
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:56,454
for chronical conditions or readmissions,
allowing for timely interventions.

88
00:06:57,074 --> 00:07:01,684
Analytics further enhance clinician,
clinical decision support, guiding

89
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:06,184
positions with data driven insights
to improve the diagnostics, accuracy,

90
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:08,124
and personalized treatment plans.

is reshaping both patient.

97
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,634
and operational
effectiveness in healthcare.

98
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:39,784
Then, the next topic is like on
the integration of legacy systems,

99
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,014
with the latest technologies.

100
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:52,334
First, let's talk about the
challenges of integration.

101
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:57,244
as, healthcare technology
evolves, the seamless integration

102
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:00,959
of new systems with the legacy
infrastructure remains a challenge.

103
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,939
critical challenge for
the health care providers.

104
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:09,289
The continuity of patient care depends
on ensuring that new technologies

105
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:14,609
such as electronic health records,
telehealth systems, and the other AI

106
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:20,079
tools are successfully integrated to
into the existing IT environments.

107
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:25,439
The challenge is underscored by the
fact that 19 percent of the hospital

108
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,769
executives cite, integration with the
legacy systems as a top IT priority.

109
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:37,539
These legacy systems are often outdated,
fragmented, and incompatible with the

110
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,289
modern technologies, creating data
issues that hinder real time access

111
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,949
to patient information and reduce the
overall efficiency in clinical workflows.

112
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:53,899
to address these challenges, the FHIR and
the other standardized data frameworks

113
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,329
are playing a pr a very important role.

114
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,839
The FHIR based solutions facilitate
a smoother integration by

115
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:06,579

119
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:24,879
or remote monitoring systems
into hospital IT infrastructure.

120
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:31,959
With FHIR, the healthcare providers can
improve the interoperability, ensuring

121
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,999
that patient data flows seamlessly
between different departments, hospitals,

122
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:42,389
and even external health systems,
thus enhancing the care coordination.

123
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,889
Let's talk about the blockchain
and the importance of cloud

124
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,129
migration in the next slides.

125
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,769
the cloud, migration.

126
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,209
So the cloud migration is another
key strategy that healthcare

127
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:12,499
organizations are trying to
overcome the integration challenges.

128
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:19,869
So the global healthcare cloud computing
market is exported to reach, 65 billion

129
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,779
by next year, driven by the demand for
scalable and cost effective solutions.

130
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:30,909
So to migrate to the cloud offers,
increase scalability, allowing the

131
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:35,649
healthcare chains to easily expand their
IT capabilities without the need for large

132
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,439
scale, large scale like, investments.

133
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:45,134
The cloud based platforms provide flexible
and secure environments that enable the

134
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:50,134

135
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:56,894
analytics at a lower cost and with
faster, time and a faster turnaround time.

136
00:10:57,404 --> 00:11:03,794
So this shift not only enhances system
performance, but also offers real time

137
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:07,984
data accessibility, supporting more
responsive and efficient patient care.

138
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:09,499
So bye.

139
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:15,599
Leveraging the cloud healthcare systems
can reduce the complexity and cost with

140
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,089
maintaining the on premise hardware
while improving the overall integration

141
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:23,589
with innovative healthcare technologies.

142
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:28,479
next is a blockchain.

143
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:31,429
So blockchain for the

144
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,239
another emerging solution for secure
and efficient data exchange is a

145
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:45,549
blockchain technology, which provides a
decentralized and tamper resistant method

146
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:47,699
for sharing sensitive healthcare data.

147
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:53,339
So blockchain has the potential to
save the healthcare industry 100 to

148
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,219
150 billion annually by next year,
primarily by reducing the data breaches,

149
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:01,599
IT costs, and operational costs.

150
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:02,794
inefficiencies.

151
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:08,674
So blockchain ensures data
integrity and security by creating

152
00:12:08,964 --> 00:12:10,914
immutable records of transactions.

153
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:17,009
A notable example is an pilot project
involving two major healthcare chains,

154
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:22,639
which used blockchain to synchronize
the provided data across the systems.

155
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:29,079
So this initiative, showed a 50 percent
reduction in admin costs by emulating the

156
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:31,439
data and discrepancies, reducing errors.

157
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:36,019
which really showed the, which really
shows a major, reduction in the cost.

158
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:50,039
So with these, new technologies,
what is, we have for the future.

159
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:55,450
invest in the digital infra.

160
00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:00,319
So healthcare organizations should
upgrade their IT systems to work with the

161
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:01,809
new technologies and allow for growth.

162
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:09,429
The hospitals that, made a huge investment
in better digital systems saw a 2.

163
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,939
5 increase in profit margins.

164
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:16,469
So the focus on the data management,
the poor data quality is costing

165
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:19,509
the US healthcare systems
billions of dollars each year.

166
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,989
By improving the data management, they
can cut down the errors by 30 percent

167
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,079
and make more reliable decisions.
