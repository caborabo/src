280
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,320
This diagram visually represents the flow
and, integration of a threat intelligence

281
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,110
platform within your security framework.

282
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:10,820
We have threat intelligence platform,
which has aggregated aggregation of data.

283
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,060
and then, using aggregation data, we
have, data analysis and actionable

284
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,840
intelligence, generated by the TIP.

285
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,458

from a wide array of threats.

288
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:36,438
Now let's dive into Intuition Detection
System, and IDS in short, monitors

289
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:40,748
network traffic from suspicious
activity and potential threats.

290
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:46,878
This helps in alerting security
teams to any anomalies that

291
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:48,428
could indicate a security breach.

292
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:53,778
Ideas can be classified into two
types, one being network based ideas

293
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:55,418
and the other being host based ideas.

294
00:18:55,418 --> 00:19:02,208
Network based ideas monitors
network traffic across the entire

295
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,768
infrastructure, detecting threats
that move through the network.

296
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:11,928
Host based ideas focuses on individual
devices, monitoring for suspicious

297
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:16,448
activity at the endpoint level, making
it ideal for detecting insider threats.

298
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:19,668
or attacks on specific assets.

299
00:19:21,518 --> 00:19:24,738
Both network and host based
IDAs are critical components in

300
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:27,368
identifying and mitigating threats
within a cloud environment.

301
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:32,858
detection systems utilize different
detection methods, which help in

302
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:33,988
identifying potential threats.

303
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:36,978
We have signature based detection.

304
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:40,398
This method encompasses network
traffic against a database

305
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:41,938
of known threat signatures.

306
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:45,598
It's effective for detecting
known threats, but may miss novel,

307
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:47,138
previously identified attacks.

308
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:50,678
We have next anomaly based detection.

309
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:54,478
This approach uses machine learning
and statistic models to detect

310
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:55,738
deviations from normal network.

311
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:01,758
It's more adept at identifying
new or unknown threats

312
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:06,128
that can generate more false positives.

313
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:11,883
In terms of response capabilities,
passive ideas is the type of ideas

314
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:15,513
which allows the security team but
doesn't take action against or detect

315
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:21,543
a threat Leading the response to human
intervention, we have next active ideas,

316
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:24,583
also known as inclusion prevention system.

317
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:28,693
These systems can automatically
block or mitigate detected threats,

318
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:30,983
providing real, real time protection.

319
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:35,453
I solutions can, integrate with the.

320
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:39,833
Threat intelligence platforms for
enriched threat data and automated

321
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:43,063
response mechanisms, enhancing
their overall effectiveness.

322
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:47,673
They are also compatible with
other security platforms like

323
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,953
firewalls, security information,
and event management systems,

324
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:54,403
ensuring comprehensive protection.

325
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:59,753
Finally, when considering IDRS
implementation, it's important to

326
00:20:59,763 --> 00:21:01,203
evaluate their performance impact.

327
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:05,613
This includes ensuring that they can
handle high volumes of network traffic.

328
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:09,753
without introducing significant
latency, which is critical for

329
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:11,283
maintaining operational efficiency.

330
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:16,143
This slide presents a comparison
table of different AIR intelligence

331
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:19,223
detection systems based on their
detection methods, response

332
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:21,463
capabilities, and integration options.

333
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:28,173
We have three solutions here
which you can compare, one

334
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:29,573
being signature based detection.

335
00:21:30,303 --> 00:21:33,833
This method relies on comparing network
traffic against a database of known

336
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:37,393
threat signatures, which is effective
for identifying well known threats.

337
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:41,088
However, it may miss novel attacks.

338
00:21:41,498 --> 00:21:46,398
this offers a passive ideas approach,
meaning it allows the security

339
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:50,268
team to such special activities,
but takes on automated action.

340
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:52,088
It takes no automated action.

341
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:59,118
It integrates with TIPS and firewalls,
providing a basic layer of protection.

342
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:04,698
We have an IDEAS B, for an example,
which employs anomaly based detection,

343
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:10,043
which uses machine learning and
sophisticated statistical models to

344
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:13,593
detect deviations from network behavior.

345
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:16,323
This data is more adept

346
00:22:18,473 --> 00:22:22,960
and can identify new or unknown threats,
but can generate more false positives.

347
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,133
It is based on active ideas capable of
automatically responding to threats, but

348
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,736
blocking or mitigating them in real time.

349
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:34,223
It integrates with SIEMs.

350
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:40,173
and tips, making it ideal for more
dynamic and complex environments.

351
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:43,283
We have mixed IDS C.

352
00:22:43,553 --> 00:22:48,243
This solution offers a hybrid
detection method that combines

353
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:52,303
both signature and anomaly based
approaches, providing a balanced and

354
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:54,233
comprehensive detection mechanism.

355
00:22:55,153 --> 00:23:01,063
Like IDS B, IDS C is also an active IDS
with automated response capabilities.

356
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:06,443
It offers the broadest integration
options, working seamlessly

357
00:23:06,443 --> 00:23:08,333
with TIPS, FIEMs, and firewalls.

358
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:12,228
So we have a holistic security framework.

359
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:17,318
Understanding these differences can
help you choose the right idea solution

360
00:23:17,878 --> 00:23:21,998
that's that best fits your organizational
specific needs and security posture.

361
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:29,478
Now let's visualize how these ideas tools
fit into broader security infrastructure.

362
00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:36,048
We have this diagram which illustrates
how ideas integrate with a broader

363
00:23:36,378 --> 00:23:40,548
security infrastructure including threat
intelligence platform and security

364
00:23:40,548 --> 00:23:42,418
information and event management systems.

365
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:47,058
At the core of this diagram, we
have IDS, which plays a central

366
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:50,338
role in monitoring network traffic
and identifying potential threats.

367
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:55,308
It feeds information to TIPS, which
enhance threat detection by aggregating

368
00:23:55,318 --> 00:23:57,398
and analyzing data from multiple sources.

369
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:03,063
TIP then processes this information,
generates actionable intelligence

370
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:07,251
that can be fed back to, the ideas
for, for real time threat prevention.

371
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:13,541
Then we have SRM systems, which are also
integrated into this ecosystem, serving

372
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:17,911
as a hub for collecting, analyzing,
and storing log data for various, from

373
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:20,891
various sources, including ideas and tips.

374
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:27,601
This diagram also shows, security
organization, orchestration, and

375
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:29,131
automation response tools and tools.

376
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:34,536
which can be integrated further automating
the incident response processes by

377
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:42,496
triggering predefined actions based on
insights provided by TIPS and SIM systems.

378
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:47,356
This holistic approach to security
ensures that your organization

379
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:48,756
has multiple layers of defense.

380
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:52,931
With each component reinforcing
the others to create a robust

381
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:54,261
and dynamic security posture.

382
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:59,201
Next, we'll explore some real world
case studies that demonstrates

383
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:01,901
the effectiveness of these
integrated security solutions.

384
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:05,671
Firstly, we talk about
Capital One Data Breach.

385
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:12,531
In 2019, Capital One experienced a major
data breach that exposed the security,

386
00:25:12,631 --> 00:25:15,981
like sensitive personal information
of more than 100 million customers.

387
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:16,261
Bye.

388
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:22,651
This breach was caused by a misconfigured
firewall on a cloud based storage system,

389
00:25:22,661 --> 00:25:24,291
which allows, unauthorized access.

390
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:29,331
The security gap was, the attack
exploited weak, weak access controls.

391
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,376
And a misconfigured web
application firewall.

392
00:25:32,756 --> 00:25:36,166
The attacker used a vulnerability in this
infrastructure to gain access to sensitive

393
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:38,286
data stored in Amazon S3 buckets.

394
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:44,746
this breach resulted in a significant
financial loss for Capital One, including

395
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:48,946
an 80 million fine by the Office of the

396
00:25:51,706 --> 00:25:54,376
Controller of the Currency, which is OCC.

397
00:25:54,416 --> 00:26:01,966
It also damaged the company's, The
learned being, this emphasize the

398
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:07,566
importance of, properly configuring cloud
security settings, regularly auditing

399
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:10,096
and updating security configurations.

400
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:14,981
Also employing stronger access
control to protect sensitive data.

401
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:21,151
Another notable case is Netflix approach
to security automation and orchestration.

402
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:27,091
Netflix, as a leading streaming service
provider, operates entirely on cloud using

403
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:29,331
AWS to manage its infrastructure as well.

404
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:34,440
Given its massive scale, Netflix faced
potential threats from large scale

405
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:36,190
cyberattacks, including DDoS attacks.

406
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:38,461
inside our threats and data breaches.

407
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:43,231
To counter these threats, Netflix
implemented a multi layered security

408
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:46,991
strategy that includes advanced threat
detection systems, continuous monitoring,

409
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:51,621
and the development of internal security
tools such as Security Monkey and

410
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:53,841
Limo to automate security processes.

411
00:26:56,356 --> 00:27:00,306
Netflix also adopted a chaos engineering
approach, regularly simulating

412
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:04,946
failures and security breaches to
test the robustness of its systems.

413
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:11,676
Netflix's proactive approach has
significantly reduced security incidents,

414
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:18,276
enhancing its ability to quickly detect
and respond to threats, and it also

415
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:20,536
improved its overall security policy.

416
00:27:22,816 --> 00:27:27,686
Similarly, Sony PlayStation Network Breach
offers some important lessons as well.

417
00:27:28,006 --> 00:27:28,896
So let's talk about that.

418
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:34,606
it was a while back, in 2011, Sony's
PlayStation network was hacked.

419
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:39,606
which led to a theft of personal
information from, 77 million

420
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:41,326
user accounts, including
credit card details as well.

421
00:27:42,316 --> 00:27:46,206
The attack was facilitated by
inadequate security measures, including

422
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:50,416
outdated software and insufficient
encryption of sensitive data.

423
00:27:51,306 --> 00:27:56,101
The breach forced Sony to
shut down the PSN for 23 days.

424
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,691
resulting in a significant
loss of revenue.

425
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:04,721
Sony also faced numerous lawsuits and
had to invest heavily in improving

426
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:05,941
its security infrastructure.

427
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:12,961
This case underscores the need for
regularly updating software, encrypting

428
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:17,491
sensitive data, and implementing
strong incident response protocols to

429
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:19,521
mitigate the effects of a data breach.

430
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:24,221
Dropbox's multi layered security
approach provides another

431
00:28:24,221 --> 00:28:25,261
instructive example as well.

432
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:26,521
So let's talk about that.

433
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:31,701
Dropbox, as is a cloud based
file storage service used by

434
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:33,021
millions of users worldwide,

435
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:39,051
like including enterprises
that store sensitive data.

436
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:44,281
As a cloud service provider, Dropbox
faced threats from data breaches and

437
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:49,811
unauthorized access and data leaks, which
could compromise the privacy of its users.

438
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:55,971
So Dropbox adopted a multi layered
security approach as well, including

439
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:59,761
two factor authentication, encryption of
data at rest, and I'm in transit as well.

440
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:01,027
security audits.

441
00:29:01,027 --> 00:29:05,958
Dropbox also engages in regular
penetration testing and has

442
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:10,889
a robust boundary program to
identify vulnerabilities as well.

443
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:16,041
Because of this comprehensive
security strategy, Dropbox maintains

444
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,881
a strong security record with
minimal incidents of data breaches.

445
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:22,761
The proactive measures taken
by Dropbox have significantly

446
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:26,711
enhanced its operation as a secure
cloud storage provider as well.

447
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:32,171
Looking ahead, what are the
emerging threats in cloud security?

448
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:36,911
So let's explore some of the future
trends as computing continues to

449
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:41,891
evolve or shape or does the threats
and challenges associated with it.

450
00:29:43,111 --> 00:29:46,191
Let's explore some of the emerging threats
that organizations need to be aware of.

451
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:53,511
Firstly, container security issues,
containers, which efficient, while

452
00:29:53,511 --> 00:29:57,551
efficient can introduce vulnerabilities
if not properly secured, especially

453
00:29:57,551 --> 00:29:58,901
when using shared resources.

454
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:04,781
This can lead to privilege escalation
or container escapes where an

455
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:08,001
attacker breaks out of a container
to gain access to other host systems.

456
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,521
You have serverless
architecture vulnerabilities.

457
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:16,831
Serverless environments reduce
the attack surface, but can.

458
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:20,541
Still be vulnerable to issues
like insecure configurations,

459
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:22,041
mismanaged permissions, etc.

460
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:24,051
You have supply chain attacks.

461
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:28,861
As organizations more rely more on
third party vendors, supply chain

462
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:32,961
attacks, where attackers compromise the
security provided to infiltrate their

463
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,701
customers are becoming more common.

464
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:39,981
So some of the strategies for these, for
mitigating some of these threats, right?

465
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:45,591
If we, if we talk about that, we have
adopting zero trust architecture, which

466
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:49,191
means implementing a zero trust model
where no entity inside or outside,

467
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:54,401
outside of the network is trusted by
default, continuously verifying users

468
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:56,251
and devices before granting access.

469
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,846
Ensuring that even those within
the network are monitored

470
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:02,826
and authenticated regularly.

471
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:05,456
We have regular security audits.

472
00:31:08,396 --> 00:31:10,966
Basically conducting frequent
security audits to identify

473
00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:12,166
and address vulnerabilities.

474
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:17,696
And then we have vendor risk management,
which strengthens supply chain security

475
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:22,346
by carefully vetting vendors, requiring
them to adhere to security standards, etc.

476
00:31:24,886 --> 00:31:30,341
Let's look at the future trends as well
in cloud security that are shaping up.

477
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:36,331
As we look into the future, cloud
security will increasingly rely on

478
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:39,891
advanced technologies to protect
or against involving threats.

479
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:44,991
Two key trends, trends are at forefront,
which are AI driven threat detection

480
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:46,691
and quantum resistant encryption.

481
00:31:46,691 --> 00:31:51,051
Yeah, AI driven, or artificial
intelligence and machine learned driven

482
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:57,620
are becoming, are becoming integral to
detect, This technology can identify

483
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:06,180
vast amounts of data at very incredible
speeds, enabling us to detect anomalies

484
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:08,373
and potential threats that might be
missed by traditional creativity measures.

485
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:09,170
We have quantum resistant

486
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,010
encryption,

487
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,460
which is being developed to protect
data against potential future threats.

488
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,170
quantum computing.

489
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,380
Quantum computers could potentially
break traditional encryption methods

490
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,490
such as RSA and ECC by solving complex
mathematical problems exponentially

491
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,380
faster than classic computers.

492
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,620
To counter this threat, new encryption
algorithms are being developed.

493
00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:41,655
Together, these environments represent
the cutting edge of cloud security,

494
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:44,415
providing robust defenses against
both current and future threats.

495
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:49,005
Organizations that adopt these
technologies will be better equipped to

496
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:53,605
protect their data in an increasingly
complex and dangerous cyber landscape.

497
00:32:55,885 --> 00:33:01,565
Let's look at this encryption,
quantum resistant encryption, and

498
00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:05,005
AI driven encryption, and why it's
crucial for the future as well.

499
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:09,695
Quantum computing poses a significant
threat to encryption methods, as we rely

500
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:14,075
on the vulnerability of current encryption
and quantum resistance algorithms.

501
00:33:14,715 --> 00:33:17,895
Quantum computers have the potential to
break widely used encryption methods,

502
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:24,615
because they solve mathematical
problems exponentially faster

503
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:25,935
than classical computers.

504
00:33:27,335 --> 00:33:31,015
This capability would encryption
techniques ineffective.

505
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,860
Exposing sensitive data
to potential breaches.

506
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:40,020
To counter this threat, new encryption
algorithms are being developed that are

507
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,140
resistant to quantum attacks as well.

508
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,340
As we prepare for the advent of quantum
computing, organizations must begin

509
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,180
assessing their current encryption
methods and planning for the transition

510
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,250
to quantum resistant encryption as well.

511
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,980
How do we prepare for these, right?

512
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,640
Organizations should assess their
current encryption methods, like I said.

513
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:10,355
And then, also transition like planning,
begin like planning for the transition

514
00:34:10,355 --> 00:34:14,585
to quantum register and encryption
techniques, including, new algorithms

515
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,285
and updating key management practices.

516
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:22,855
And also, organizations need to be
stay informed, on what, encryption

517
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:26,705
techniques are being built, and then,
necessity of, adopting them as a.

518
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:36,670
In summary, let's review the key points
we have covered today and look at how

519
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:44,310
our missions can stay ahead to mitigate
any emerging and existing threats.

520
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,950
In summary, we have explored the
critical aspects of cloud computing

521
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:52,720
security, including the importance of
multi layer protection strategy and

522
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,120
the role of advanced threat detection.

523
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,920
By understanding the various
levels, layers of protection and

524
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,660
employing cutting edge technologies
to detect and mitigate threats.

525
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,030
Organizations can significantly
enhance their cloud security posture.

526
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,980
As cloud computing continues to evolve,
staying informed about future trends and

527
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,680
adapting security strategies will be key
to maintaining robust cloud security.

528
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,207
The integration of AI driven threat
detection systems and the adoption of

529
00:35:19,207 --> 00:35:22,725
quantum resistance, resistance encryption
are just two examples of how the

530
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:25,205
industry is preparing for the future.

531
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:30,115
By being proactive and forward thinking,
organizations can protect their data and

532
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:31,955
maintain the trust of their customers.

533
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,220
Finally, thank you for the
opportunity and hope you for I hope

534
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,200
you find the information valuable.

535
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,140
Thank you again.
