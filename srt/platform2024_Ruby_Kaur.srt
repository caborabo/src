1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,819
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,530
Thank you for taking the time
out of your day to be here.

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,079
I'm delighted to be here today
to talk about crafting an

4
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,049
effective developer roadmap.

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,209
This process is essential for ensuring
that our development efforts are

6
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:29,749
aligned with our business goals.

7
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:33,464
and can effectively address
the challenges our teams face.

8
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:35,394
A little bit about myself.

9
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:40,184
As a seasoned product manager, I have
honed my skills in leading both front

10
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:41,994
end and back end product development.

11
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:48,264
Currently, I play a pivotal role
at Bestech, a fintech firm, where

12
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:51,244
I drive the product strategy
for our communications division.

13
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:56,894
I've also worked at firms such
as AWS, where I orchestrated the

14
00:00:56,894 --> 00:01:00,525
product strategy for automating
AWS infrastructure deployment.

15
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:05,904
At Newmark, I headed their product
department, successfully leading a

16
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:10,864
website redesign on Microsoft Azure
and establishing a dedicated team on

17
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,995
customer centric product development.

18
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:19,585
I also worked at Moody's, where I was
head of deploying cloud data leaks

19
00:01:19,604 --> 00:01:24,845
on the AWS tech stack, enhancing ETL
processes and data analytics capabilities.

20
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:28,315
I'm also committed to
fostering innovation.

21
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:32,405
I actively serve as a board member,
providing strategic direction and

22
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:37,464
technical acumen to enhance the growth
trajectory of a company by the name

23
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,455
of Yieldwink's digital platform.

24
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,485
We have a jam packed agenda,
so let's get started.

25
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:42,729
Let's get started.

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,169
We'll start by understanding the
fundamental importance of roadmaps.

27
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,300
A roadmap serves as a strategic
guide that outlines the direction and

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,660
priorities for our development efforts.

29
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:59,119
It's not just a plan, but a communication
tool that aligns everyone in the

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,069
organization, from stakeholders
to developers, on what needs to be

31
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,659
achieved and how we intend to get there.

32
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:07,520
It's a product strategy.

33
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,250
It's crucial to have
a solid understanding.

34
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,950
Of our business and
organizational strategies.

35
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,610
These strategies provide the foundation
upon which we build our product plans.

36
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,160
They help us understand the broader
goals of the organization and

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,210
ensure that our development efforts
are contributing to these goals.

38
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,700
Let me give you a concrete example.

39
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,330
Suppose our company's overarching
strategy is to increase revenue

40
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,869
by 20 percent over the next year.

41
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:39,469
Bye.

42
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,430
For our product strategy, this means
we need to align our development

43
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,890
efforts with these revenue focus goals.

44
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,120
We might prioritize building features
that improve cross sell, up sell,

45
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:58,250
like showing customers premium plans,
or help with renewal probabilities.

46
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,540
By aligning our product strategy
with the company's revenue goals,

47
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,725
we ensure that every piece of code
written And every feature developed

48
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:10,785
is a step towards achieving these
broader business objectives.

49
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:16,145
This alignment not only helps in
achieving our revenue targets, but

50
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:19,705
also ensures that our development
efforts are recognized as valuable

51
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:21,835
contributions to the company's success.

52
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:23,424
Concepts of life.

53
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:25,335
Let's take a practical case study.

54
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:29,915
Our case study today focuses
on a significant challenge.

55
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:32,335
A made up company has been facing.

56
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,250
They are a marketing led company,
and communication in the form of

57
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,290
emails is a very big revenue driver.

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,290
But the business problem is, it
takes too long for us to get email

59
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,150
communications out to our customers.

60
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,409
This delay in communication affects
our business in several critical ways.

61
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,769
Firstly, let's frame the problem clearly.

62
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,540
The time it currently takes from
conceptualizing an email campaign

63
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,425
by our marketers to engineers
actually delivering it to our

64
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:07,665
customers is longer than we desire.

65
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:15,065
This lag impacts our ability to respond
quickly to market opportunities, customer

66
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:16,825
feedback, and competitive pressures.

67
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:23,115
It means that by time our emails
reach our customers, the information

68
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:26,945
might already be outdated, reducing
its relevance and effectiveness.

69
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,155
Now let's talk about the business
value if we solve this problem.

70
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:37,255
The faster we can get our email
communications out, the quicker

71
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:40,765
we can realize revenue or
increase our monthly active users.

72
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:45,364
In other words, reducing the
time to value is crucial.

73
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:53,404
This case study, framed by how might
we statement, how might we deliver

74
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:57,714
an email communication in under
an hour, when given this problem.

75
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,390
Will guide us through the process of
identifying pain points, prioritizing

76
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,180
them and developing actionable solutions.

77
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,909
By addressing this challenge, we not only
improve our operational efficiency, but

78
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,399
also drive significant business outcomes.

79
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,095
perform a current state assessment
of our technology stack.

80
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:25,184
We won't be going over technical details
today, but just high level frameworks.

81
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:30,865
For today's case study, we'll focus,
we'll be focusing on reviewing a part of

82
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:35,725
our marketing technology stack, focusing
on the email communication process.

83
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:41,074
This assessment involves a deep dive
into our existing tools, processes,

84
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:44,885
and capabilities, and how well
they support our business outcomes.

85
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:50,475
To get a comprehensive view, we
interviewed different personas involved

86
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,275
in this email communication workflow.

87
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,470
These personas include marketers,
engineers, and customer

88
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,630
support representatives.

89
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,460
To better understand the high level
pains and needs within this process, we

90
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,689
utilize the Jobs to be Done framework.

91
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,920
This framework helps us focus on what each
persona is trying to achieve, the obstacle

92
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,870
they face, and the outcomes they desire.

93
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,150
By framing our understanding around
their jobs, we gain valuable insight into

94
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,850
their key pain points and motivations.

95
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,160
Analyzing the feedback from
these interviews through the

96
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,520
Jobs to be Done lens, we decided
to focus on the engineers.

97
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,460
Why engineers?

98
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,900
Because they play a critical role
in the development and deployment

99
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,989
of the systems that enable
faster dissemination of emails.

100
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,629
By addressing the engineers pain
points first, we can streamline

101
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,800
the entire email delivery process.

102
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,080
This will allow us to release email
communications to customers more quickly.

103
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,490
which directly supports our company's
goals of increasing revenue.

104
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,300
The clear understanding of our
current state and the personas

105
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,240
we're focusing on, we can now define
our vision and success criteria.

106
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,700
This vision acts as our target
destination, while the success

107
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,329
criteria provide measurable
benchmarks to track our progress.

108
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,669
Our vision is to enable the engineering
team to deliver email communications

109
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,229
to customers in under an hour.

110
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,470
Achieving this will significantly
improve our operational efficiency

111
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,909
and align with our company's strategic
goal of increasing revenue by

112
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,430
facilitating quicker market responses
and enhancing customer engagement.

113
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,760
To set clear success criteria, we need
to outline specific measurable goals that

114
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,660
indicate progress towards our vision.

115
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,679
These criteria might include
what listed to your left.

116
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:58,095
You might want to include reduction
in email delivery time, which is

117
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:02,365
decreasing the time it takes to
deliver an email campaign from several

118
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:04,445
days or weeks to under an hour.

119
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:10,695
We might want to focus on increasing
engineering productivity, enhancing

120
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:15,585
system reliability, or focusing
on stakeholder satisfaction.

121
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,895
So increasing satisfaction levels
among marketing and customer support

122
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:24,575
teams by providing faster and more
reliable email communication tools.

123
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,380
Or we focus on none of the
above or all of the above.

124
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,799
Next,

125
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,160
we have our how might me
statement on the left.

126
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,289
Walk through the developer
journey and identify the pain

127
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,260
points experience at each stage.

128
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,490
At this stage, we list out the
common engineering development

129
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,770
journeys and ask them to list out
all pain points based in these areas.

130
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,840
As it relates to deploying
an email communication.

131
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,580
That is what in the middle of the screen.

132
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,005
Next, The tool of choice here is
Miro, but you can use whatever

133
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:04,605
tool works for you and your team.

134
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:09,035
The journey here includes
requirements gathering.

135
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:15,335
Here, engineers often face challenges like
unclear requirements, changing priorities,

136
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:17,185
and lack of stakeholder alignment.

137
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:21,915
These issues can lead to
significant delays and rework.

138
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:24,785
Moving on to development.

139
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:29,814
During development, pain points
might include inadequate tooling,

140
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,930
technical debt, and integration issues.

141
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,600
These factors can hinder productivity
and extend development cycles.

142
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,430
Next, we have UAT or
user acceptance testing.

143
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,629
In this phase, engineers may encounter
challenges like insufficient testing

144
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:53,830
environments, poor test data quality,
and limited feedback loops, all

145
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,420
of which can delay deployment.

146
00:09:58,195 --> 00:09:59,225
You then have deployment.

147
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:04,555
Deployment pain points often involve
complex deployment processes, manual

148
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:06,735
interventions, and configuration errors.

149
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,854
These issues can lead to failed
deployment times or failed

150
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:12,655
deployments and increased downtime.

151
00:10:14,144 --> 00:10:15,415
And then we have monitoring.

152
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:20,125
Post deployment monitoring can be
hampered by inadequate monitoring

153
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,405
tools, lack of real time alerts,
and insufficient metrics.

154
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,480
This makes it difficult to quickly
identify and resolve issues.

155
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,970
Identifying these pain points is
crucial as it allows us to focus on

156
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,210
the areas that need the most attention.

157
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,510
Once we've listed the pain points, the
next step is to vote on their severity.

158
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:46,740
We take each sticky from the prior slide
and categorize each pain point as high,

159
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,800
medium, or low severity based on the
impact it has on our ability to deliver

160
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,280
email communication in under an hour.

161
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,140
Remember to always tie it back
to the problem we are solving.

162
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,290
The voting process helps us prioritize
the issues that have the most

163
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,129
significant impact on our goals.

164
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:16,379
So for example, a pain point like unclear
requirements might be rated as high

165
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,690
severity because it affects multiple
stages of the development process.

166
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:23,655
So how might we decrease time to value?

167
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,835
Severity ratings, we then plot these
pain points on a quadrant chart.

168
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:35,414
But now the team will help us estimate
how high or low the effort might be

169
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:36,905
in solving some of these problems.

170
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:43,404
The y axis represents impact and
the x axis represents effort.

171
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:48,935
This categorization helps us
identify what on the top right

172
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:51,335
quadrant Which is major wins.

173
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:54,845
These are high impact and high effort.

174
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:59,075
These are critical issues that
require significant investment but

175
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:01,095
will greatly benefit the project.

176
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,744
What you see next to that is quick wins.

177
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:06,955
High impact and low effort.

178
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:11,155
These are the low hanging fruit
that can be addressed quickly

179
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:12,485
to yield immediate benefits.

180
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,715
Below that we see fill ins.

181
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:18,345
Low impact and low effort.

182
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:22,555
These are the nice to have
improvements that can be tackled

183
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:24,205
when there's extra capacity.

184
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:31,574
Next to that, we have money
pits, low impact, high effort.

185
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:36,255
They should be deprioritized
as they consume resources

186
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:37,755
without significant benefits.

187
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:42,805
You'd be surprised at how many
organizations have money pit items

188
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:46,344
in their backlog and end the year
with very low value delivered.

189
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,470
Focusing on the high impact areas
first ensures that we are making the

190
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,540
most effective use of our resources.

191
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,530
Now that we know what problems
we need to solve, we can start

192
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,960
our product discovery phase.

193
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,110
In this phase, we focus on high
level discovery without getting

194
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,559
into the technical details yet.

195
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,709
This involves brainstorming
potential solutions and defining

196
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,040
the scope of our initiatives.

197
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,259
Here are the steps we typically
follow during product discovery.

198
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,350
Brainstorming solutions.

199
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:25,630
Defining epics, clear acceptance
criteria, prioritizing epics,

200
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,970
and then creating a road map.

201
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,520
Now let's double click on some of these.

202
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,270
brainstorming solutions.

203
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,450
We gather a diverse team of stakeholders,
including engineering, product

204
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,940
managers, and business analysts, to
brainstorm possible solutions for the

205
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,060
identified high impact pain points.

206
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,525
This Creative approach ensures that
we consider various perspectives

207
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:50,295
and come up with innovative ideas.

208
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:51,795
Finding epics.

209
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:55,775
We then consolidate these
ideas into high level epics.

210
00:13:56,455 --> 00:14:00,285
An epic is a large body of work
that can be broken down into

211
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:02,275
smaller tasks or user stories.

212
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:07,775
For instance, if a major pain
point may be the lack of a

213
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:12,135
development testing environment,
an epic might be establishment of

214
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:13,535
developing testing environment.

215
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:17,625
You then want to set acceptance criteria.

216
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,845
For each EPIC, we define
clear acceptance criteria.

217
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:26,405
These criteria outline what success
looks like for each EPIC and

218
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:30,795
provide a way to measure whether the
solution meets the desired outcomes.

219
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:37,145
For example, the acceptance
criteria for our established, the

220
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:42,220
establishment of development testing
environment a significant reduction

221
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,070
in bugs and issues post deployment.

222
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,420
And then we want to prioritize epics.

223
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,860
After the finding the epics and their
acceptance criteria, we prioritize them

224
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,850
based on their impact and feasibility.

225
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,910
This prioritization helps us focus
on the most critical issues first,

226
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,080
ensuring that we deliver maximum
value as quickly as possible.

227
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:15,115
And finally, we create a high
level roadmap that outlines a

228
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,475
sequence of epics we plan to tackle.

229
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:23,035
This roadmap serves as a strategic
plan that guides our development

230
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:25,035
efforts over the next quarter or year.

231
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:30,995
This roadmap is a living document,
always subject to change as new

232
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:34,505
challenges arise and priorities shift.

233
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,090
However, it provides a structured
plan that aligns our development

234
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,200
efforts with our strategic goals.

235
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,360
I always recommend using now
next and later as the first

236
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,800
presentation of the roadmap.

237
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,420
While you start to flesh out the
actual work this entails to provide

238
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,130
accurate estimations of delivery.

239
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,630
This product discovery phase is crucial
because it ensures that we have a clear

240
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,640
and actionable plan for addressing
the high impact pain points first.

241
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:09,495
By involving a diverse team in the
brainstorming process and setting clear

242
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:13,995
acceptance criteria, we can develop
solutions that are both innovative

243
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:15,755
and aligned with our strategic goals.

244
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:21,815
Once our plan is finalized, the product
manager can collaborate with the engineers

245
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:23,385
to further refine the work details.

246
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:28,165
Initially, we may focus on the
minimum viable product or MVP

247
00:16:28,165 --> 00:16:32,395
version of the plan, ensuring it
effectively addresses the problems

248
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:34,175
and aligns with our business goals.

249
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,880
On the right is an example
timeline for breaking down the

250
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,120
plan before we start writing our
technical requirement documents

251
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,340
and entering them into the backlog.

252
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,050
From roadmap to backlog.

253
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,090
Finally, the product manager translates
these roadmap items into detailed

254
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,430
product requirement documents.

255
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,060
These documents are then used to create
user stories that populate our backlog.

256
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,110
This ensures that the development
team has a clear, Prioritize

257
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,830
list of tasks to work on.

258
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,000
This process ensures that every user
story is aligned with the overall

259
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,910
strategic goals and addresses the
critical pain points identified earlier.

260
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:19,770
To summarize, we've explored the
journey from identifying pain points to

261
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,820
creating a detailed developer roadmap.

262
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,340
By focusing on the most critical
challenges first and developing

263
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,240
actionable solutions, We can ensure
that our development efforts are

264
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,680
aligned with our business goals
and deliver the maximum impact.

265
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,180
This structured approach helps
us navigate the complexities of

266
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,340
software development and continuously
improve our processes and outcomes.

267
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,090
Thank you for your attention.

268
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,905
I hope this session has provided you
with valuable insights into creating

269
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,565
an effective developer roadmap.
