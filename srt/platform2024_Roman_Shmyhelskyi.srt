1
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,159
Hello everyone, my name is Roman
Shmahelsky and today I'll talk about

2
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:21,579
business acumen and why it's so
important for software engineers.

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,300
To set up the scene,
imagine you're at your desk.

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,860
You have some free time, so you open Jira
to figure out what you should do next.

5
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:32,269
There are two tasks in your backlog.

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,769
The first task is a
technologically challenging one.

7
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,739
It's complex, it involves cutting
edge technology, and it will require

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,300
you to push your skills to the limit.

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,490
Let's call this task Create Your Own LLM.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,629
It's the kind of task that gets you
excited as an engineer, because it's an

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,599
opportunity to solve a difficult problem.

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,620
However, this task will only
impact a small portion of advanced

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,860
users whom might appreciate the
value that you are building.

14
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:00,245
The second task we can
trust is much simpler.

15
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,085
It's a bit boring to be honest.

16
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:06,105
It involves streamlining few processes
and improving the user experience

17
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:09,155
for a basic function that nearly
all of your customers use daily.

18
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:13,755
Basically, moving buttons in
UI happened with all of us.

19
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:19,164
It doesn't involve anything groundbreaking
from a technical standpoint, but it

20
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:22,305
will make the product significantly
easier and more enjoyable to use

21
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:23,925
for the majority of your customers.

22
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:29,695
And here's the twist, you know you can't
do both, you need to push back on one.

23
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:32,805
Now ask yourself, which task
would you pick, and why?

24
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:37,324
When answering this question, a
lot of developers will think about

25
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:41,235
technological advancement of the
project each task could bring, or

26
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,975
perhaps some knowledge they could gain.

27
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:47,425
In simple words, they'll use their
hard skills to assess the situation.

28
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:51,164
But today, hard skills are not enough.

29
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:52,765
And let me explain you this.

30
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:57,715
Throughout my career, I've had the
privilege of working with many software

31
00:01:57,905 --> 00:02:02,125
engineers, and let me tell you, most of
them are exceptionally bright individuals.

32
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:05,515
I try to stay in touch and
follow their career closely.

33
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:09,345
There is one engineer in
particular who comes to mind.

34
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:15,075
He could easily spend hours debating
the merits of React versus Angular, or

35
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:19,035
intricate methods to optimize database
storage, or diving into the finest

36
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:21,075
details of JavaScript interpretation.

37
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:24,884
Honestly, being in the same
room with him sometimes made me

38
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:26,405
feel like I was out of my depth.

39
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,180
His ability to craft elegant solutions
to complex problems was so remarkable

40
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,380
that I found constantly putting
off my other tasks just to review

41
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,960
his code and learn something new.

42
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,190
But as the years went by, and
despite his impressive technical

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,750
achievements, promotion seems to have
passed him by, and he wasn't alone.

44
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:51,855
I've encouraged many brilliant engineers
who described their technical expertise,

45
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:55,165
struggled to gain recognition,
and move up in the career ladder.

46
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:59,744
And even if you decide to explore
opportunities elsewhere, it's

47
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:03,424
not a secret that today's job
market is highly competitive.

48
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:08,944
Every job posting attracts hundreds of
applications and dozens of interviews.

49
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:14,375
All of these engineers were
technically experts, and in today's

50
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,495
environment, that's simply not enough.

51
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:20,765
To stand out, whether you're seeking
a promotion or a new job, you need

52
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:22,585
more than just a technical excellence.

53
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:25,805
You need a soft skills
and a business acumen.

54
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:28,395
And that's what I want to
talk to you about today.

55
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:31,884
How leveraging business insights
can be your key to standing

56
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:33,224
out in this crowded field.

57
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,760
But, who am I to talk on this topic?

58
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:41,069
nearly a decade ago, I first began
my journey as a JavaScript engineer.

59
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:45,919
Over these years, I had the opportunity
to work in the wide range of environments

60
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:49,829
from small startups to corporations,
from product focus companies to

61
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,269
outsourcing companies, and each of these
experiences have shaped my perspective.

62
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,129
And recently, two years ago, I was
promoted to software engineering manager.

63
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,829
So LifeSync Syncs provides
managerial perspective as well as

64
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:07,469
individual This gives me a good
view of how business acumen plays

65
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:09,149
a crucial role in our careers.

66
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,919
Alright, before we dive back into
the soft skills, let's briefly review

67
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,309
the key actors in our projects.

68
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:22,069
In any project there are multiple parties
who shape the outcome, and each of these

69
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,439
groups brings a unique perspective to
the table and their input is crucial

70
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,924
at different stages of the project.

71
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:31,565
But when it comes to making
decision, whose opinion matter most?

72
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:36,895
The truth is that all of these
opinions are matter, but not

73
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:39,164
equally and not in every stage.

74
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:42,635
When making decisions, it's
important to prioritize these

75
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:44,244
voices based on the context.

76
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:48,065
So first and foremost,
we have the customers.

77
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,594
They are the ones who ultimately
bring the revenue, so their

78
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:53,114
needs and feedback are critical.

79
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:56,304
Business leaders are also key players.

80
00:04:57,044 --> 00:05:00,034
They are the ones who took the
risks, created the business,

81
00:05:00,164 --> 00:05:01,625
and set the overall direction.

82
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:01,694
for listening.

83
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:06,515
Without their vision and leadership, there
simply would be no project to work on.

84
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:11,975
Project managers comes next, cause
they act as a voice of customers

85
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:16,015
within our teams, translating
customers needs into actionable tasks.

86
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:19,155
And finally, we have tech teams.

87
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:23,574
While our technical expertise is
essential in bringing the project to

88
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:26,953
life, it's important to remember that our
decisions should align with overarching

89
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:29,494
business goals and customers needs.

90
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:35,054
In summary, while it might be tempting
to focus solely on the technical side,

91
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:39,215
by aligning our decisions with the
priorities of business leaders and project

92
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:43,275
managers, we can ensure that our work
not only solves the technical challenges,

93
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:46,914
but also drives the business forward
and meets the customers expectations.

94
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:51,625
Now, let's talk about how our skills
are perceived in this context.

95
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:55,655
For most managers and business
leaders, they don't come

96
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,805
from technical backgrounds.

97
00:05:57,885 --> 00:06:00,875
To them, your hard skills and
ability to code and develop

98
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:03,375
features are like a binary switch.

99
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:06,944
You either can't develop a feature
in time, or you simply can't.

100
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:11,974
And once you demonstrated a certain level
of technical proficiency, others might see

101
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:13,694
you as capable of getting the job done.

102
00:06:14,214 --> 00:06:17,165
However, due to the lack of
understanding of the complexity of the

103
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:20,805
work, they might not fully appreciate
the excellence in certain skills.

104
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:26,975
On another hand, soft skills are more like
a flaws, they exist on spectrum and can be

105
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:28,985
easily assessed by non technical people.

106
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:33,694
Your ability to communicate effectively,
collaborate with others, and think

107
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:36,044
critically are all visible and measurable.

108
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:39,744
This is why once you reach the
certain level in coding abilities,

109
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:43,495
investing good time in developing
your soft skills became crucial.

110
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:47,555
These are the skills that will
set you apart and will make your

111
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:51,525
work visible and appreciated by
everyone, not only technical folks.

112
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:55,724
And this helps you advance in
your career, when the technical

113
00:06:55,724 --> 00:06:57,804
expertise alone is no longer enough.

114
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:01,794
This all brings us to the
concept of business acumen.

115
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:04,034
So what is this business acumen about?

116
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:08,134
I would define it as a
combination of several soft skills

117
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:09,804
applied to the right context.

118
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,979
And what soft skills are we talking about?

119
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,640
Think about what's essential for starting
and running a successful business.

120
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:19,760
Problem solving.

121
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,410
Every business is funded on the need
to solve some specific problems.

122
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,260
Next, we have communication.

123
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:29,870
To be successful, you need to
be able to deliver your ideas

124
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,229
and solutions effectively.

125
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:33,979
Next, we have critical thinking.

126
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,289
Critical thinking, we have to understand
the problems that we are trying to

127
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,179
solve, and this is very essential.

128
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,249
Leadership and proactivity.

129
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:45,655
You need to take action and drive the
initiatives to achieve the success.

130
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:50,195
These are the same principles that
apply directly to software engineering.

131
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:55,154
If you think about each feature that you
work on as a small business, you would see

132
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:58,854
that the problem solving, communication,
critical thinking, and leadership

133
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:00,924
are just as crucial in our field.

134
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:04,465
Having business acumen in
software development means more

135
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:05,655
than just writing a good code.

136
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,570
It means to understand stakeholders
needs, making decisions that

137
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,879
aren't just technically sound,
but also strategically smart, and

138
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,759
anticipating the effect of your work.

139
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,070
It's ability to see beyond the immediate
technical challenge and grasp the

140
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,969
broader implications for the business.

141
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,779
This is what distinguish the good
engineers from the great ones.

142
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,974
Those who not only solve the problems,
but do it so in the way that they can.

143
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:31,504
that drives the business forward.

144
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:36,385
And you might be thinking this is all
sound very complicated and boring and I

145
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:39,625
just want to write some software without
getting caught up in the politics.

146
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,934
But let me break down what business
mastery really means in practical terms

147
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:45,645
and you'll see it's not so complex.

148
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,355
So at its core business is
all about earning money.

149
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:53,435
Even non profit organizations
need to generate income not

150
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:56,694
for profit, but to fund their
operation and achieve their goals.

151
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:59,464
And to do this, business owners employ us.

152
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:01,664
That's a sad capitalist reality.

153
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:02,645
But it's true.

154
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:06,664
The main reason we have jobs is not
to experiment with new frameworks or

155
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:11,095
play with cutting edge technology,
but to contribute to the financial

156
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:12,885
success of our organizations.

157
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:17,345
And in a software company,
making money means attracting

158
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,565
and retaining more clients.

159
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,270
As simple as that, more
clients, more money.

160
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,930
To achieve this, a few things are crucial.

161
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,700
Understand client's needs.

162
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,779
You need to know what your clients wants
and you need to figure out it fast.

163
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:33,740
It involves listening to their
feedback, analyzing market trends

164
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:37,480
and anticipating their future
needs, solving client's problems.

165
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:42,274
Once you understand what clients need,
the next step is to solve their problems.

166
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:43,994
And again, speed is of the essence.

167
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:47,845
The faster you can provide the solution,
the more competitive you become.

168
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:50,085
And iterating.

169
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:54,304
Finally, it's not enough to just
release a solution and call it a day.

170
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:58,124
You need to continuously iterate,
refine, improve, and adapt your

171
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,935
software to changing client
needs and market conditions.

172
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,395
And we need to do it fast to
stay ahead of the competition.

173
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:08,105
This cycle of understanding,
solving, iterating at the speed

174
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:11,435
is the essence of how the software
companies succeed in the marketplace.

175
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:16,145
Now you might wonder, what about
all of these business analysts,

176
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,324
product owners, and project managers?

177
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:20,074
Isn't this their job?

178
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:22,174
And you are right.

179
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:27,224
These roles are specifically designed to
focus on understanding business needs and

180
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:29,214
translating them into actionable tasks.

181
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,659
They spent years learning
and mastering these skills.

182
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,150
Your job isn't to replace them, but to
act as a bridge between their strategic

183
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,530
vision and your technical execution.

184
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:43,219
Here is where your technical
expertise becomes invaluable.

185
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:48,390
While business analysts and product
owners excel in identifying what

186
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:51,829
needs to be done, They often lack
of the technical knowledge to

187
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,819
understand the best way to solve this.

188
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,589
For example, have you ever been in a
situation when the project manager tells

189
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:01,919
you that the change is very small because
a similar change was made in another

190
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,730
project, but you realize that in reality
it's not that simple and it might require

191
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,469
significant architectural changes?

192
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,400
This is a perfect example of where your
technical knowledge comes into play.

193
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,220
By understanding both the business
goals and technical constraints,

194
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:20,280
you can propose a better solution
that meets the business needs.

195
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,319
while also being efficient and
feasible from a technical standpoint.

196
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,230
This is a win situation.

197
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,290
You're helping the business to achieve its
goals while you're ensuring the technical

198
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,600
implementation is sound and sustainable.

199
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,660
This is what business acumen looks like
in practice for a software engineer.

200
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,170
Leveraging your unique position to
connect the dots between business

201
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,939
strategy and technical execution.

202
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:47,929
Now let's talk the way how you can
develop the business acumen skills.

203
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:51,720
First step in mastering business
acumen is to truly understand the

204
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,390
industry your company operates in.

205
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:56,704
This means more than just
knowing the technical details.

206
00:11:57,335 --> 00:12:00,415
You need to learn the language
of your industry, the specific

207
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,015
terminology that is commonly used.

208
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,785
Understanding this glossary will
help you to grasp the requirements

209
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:09,285
more effectively and communicate more
fluently with non technical colleagues.

210
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:13,735
Additionally, take the time to learn
about the key aspects and regulations

211
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:15,094
that apply to your industry.

212
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,130
Every industry has its own set of rules
and standards that can significantly

213
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,610
impact how business is done.

214
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,920
By familiarizing yourself with this,
you not only improve your understanding

215
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,180
of why certain decisions are made,
but also increase your value as

216
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,000
someone who can foresee potential
challenges and opportunities.

217
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:39,120
One practical approach is to read
industry articles regularly or even

218
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,740
take the course related to your field.

219
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,870
Whether it's through online
platforms, industry publication, or

220
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,430
professional development courses.

221
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:50,015
Explaining your knowledge beyond,
expanding your knowledge beyond

222
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:53,805
just software will make you a more
rounded and insightful contributor.

223
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,595
Next, it's crucial to understand the
internal structure of your company, and

224
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:01,504
most importantly, how it makes money.

225
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:06,605
This might seem straightforward, but
it can be more complex than it appears.

226
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:10,425
For instance, the revenue model
might not be immediately obvious,

227
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:14,375
especially in larger organizations
or those with diverse product lines.

228
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:17,355
Start by learning who your customers are.

229
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:21,105
Are they individual consumers,
other businesses, or

230
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:22,585
perhaps government entities?

231
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:26,425
Then dive deeper into understanding
how your company earns revenue.

232
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,680
This could involve subscription
models, direct sales, partnership, or

233
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,570
other streams to get the information
and engage with departments within

234
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,340
your company, such as leadership,
project management, and sales.

235
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:42,810
These teams are often more than
happy to share insights about how the

236
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,239
business operates because they know.

237
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,930
When the tech team understand the
business model, everyone benefits.

238
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,340
One of the simplest yet most effective
ways to develop business acumen is by

239
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,329
listening proactively, especially during
company town halls and other board

240
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,840
meetings, this session often covers
strategic goals, company performance,

241
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,660
and future plans, essential insights
for anyone looking to understand the

242
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,720
business better, instead of just having
these meetings on the background, as

243
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,800
usual, make a point to actively listen.

244
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,290
Take notes, ask follow up questions.

245
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,310
If the opportunity arrives and reflect
on how the information shared might

246
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,490
impact your work, you'll find that
many of your answers to your questions

247
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,630
could be followed in these discussions,
providing you with a cleaner sense of

248
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,189
direction and purpose in your role.

249
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,420
When the new feature I handed over to you,
don't be afraid to ask why initialize.

250
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,930
This might be feel a bit awkward,
but it's a powerful habit to

251
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,990
develop by asking why each feature
is being implemented, you start to

252
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,550
understand the reasoning behind it.

253
00:14:45,195 --> 00:14:48,045
What problem is it solving
and why is it important now?

254
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,215
Over time, you will see the bigger
picture without even needing to ask.

255
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:56,025
You'll develop an instinct to
understanding the motivation behind

256
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:59,444
the feature requests, which allows you
to align your technical solution more

257
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:01,014
closely with the business objectives.

258
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,625
This understanding transforms your
role from simply executing tasks

259
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:07,775
to contributing strategically.

260
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:13,075
As you start connecting the dots between
the motivation and the proposed solution,

261
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,055
you might come up with even better ideas.

262
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,320
Perhaps a technologically superior
solution, or a faster approach,

263
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,800
or something that achieved both.

264
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,520
I have to admit that someone who is
a little bit lazy, there is nothing

265
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,859
more satisfying than taking just a
long boring task and proposing a minor

266
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:33,569
update to existing project that solves
the problem just as well if not better.

267
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,900
And when everyone agrees to
your proposal, it's a win.

268
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,080
Don't hesitate to share your ideas.

269
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:43,125
It's your opportunity to demonstrate
your expertise and show how deeply

270
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,085
you understand both the technical
and business sides of the equation.

271
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:51,815
Even if your idea is not as good and
not getting picked up, expressing it

272
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,975
is far better than just staying quiet.

273
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,065
It shows that you're thinking
critically about how to improve

274
00:15:57,074 --> 00:16:00,175
the business, which is exactly what
this business acumen is all about.

275
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:05,505
Finally, one of the best ways to
accelerate your development in

276
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,575
business acumen is to find a mentor.

277
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,545
But don't limit yourself
to a technical side.

278
00:16:10,974 --> 00:16:14,004
Seek out a mentor from a non
technical department or even

279
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,555
someone outside of the company.

280
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:20,185
A mentor will, with a different
perspective, can provide invaluable

281
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:24,015
insights into how the business
decisions are made, how to communicate

282
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:27,435
with more, more effectively with
non technical colleagues, and

283
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:30,704
how to position yourself as a key
contributor to the company's success.

284
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:35,775
This relationship can open up new ways
to thinking, how you can bridge the

285
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:39,475
gap between technical expertise and
business strategy, making you a more

286
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:41,545
well rounded and impactful professional.

287
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:48,895
Alright, at its core, business acumen
is all about ability to understand

288
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:52,175
the needs of others and deliver
solutions that addresses those needs.

289
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:56,164
It may take some time while
until you start seeing these

290
00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:59,754
needs of different parties, but
here are some shortcuts for you.

291
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:08,180
In startups, the focus is often on
innovation, speed, and adaptability.

292
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,839
You need to implement your products
fast, and you need to be willing

293
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,399
to pivot based on the customer
feedback and market shifts.

294
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:22,809
The need here is for agility, a solution
that can be implemented rapidly,

295
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:27,160
often with limited resources, to test
ideas and iterate based on what works.

296
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,230
Tech depth is not only
norm, but necessity.

297
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,320
Big companies prioritize stability,
scalability, and optimization.

298
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,450
Their focus is on maintaining
what they already built while

299
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,540
carefully expanding and optimizing.

300
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,530
Here is a need often for robust,
tested solutions that can handle large

301
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,480
scale operations without disruptions.

302
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,780
When working on this or with big
companies, the emphasis should be on

303
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,540
creating reliable, efficient systems
that align with existing processes

304
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,665
and can support future growth.

305
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:07,585
Product companies focus on building
and maintaining their own products.

306
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:12,315
The goal is here to create value
through innovation, user experience,

307
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:14,405
and long term customer satisfaction.

308
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:18,095
Their needs here is often to
deep understand of the domain of

309
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:21,785
the project and the strong focus
on quality and user feedback.

310
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:25,485
When you're working with a product
company, focus on understanding

311
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:28,585
the product lifecycle, user
needs, and long term vision.

312
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:33,555
Outsourcing companies, on the other
hand, provide services to businesses,

313
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:38,865
often working with the projects for a
variety of clients, their primary need

314
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:43,945
is efficiency and delivery, completing
project in time within budgets and to

315
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:48,915
the client expectations, the emphasis
on meeting client expectations and

316
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:54,505
managing resources effectively to maximize
profit margins with outsourcing firms.

317
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:57,495
The priority is delivering high
quality work efficiently and

318
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:58,735
managing clients responsibilities.

319
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:00,235
Relationships carefully.

320
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:02,305
Okay.

321
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:03,235
Project managers.

322
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:07,955
They can take a task by converting
customer's needs into actionable

323
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:11,055
requirements that could be done
with allocating the smallest

324
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:12,525
possible resources and time.

325
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:17,175
As an engineer, one of the best way you
can support your PM is by helping to

326
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:19,355
find the most effective path to solution.

327
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:23,125
This means identifying ways to
achieve the desired outcome with the

328
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,455
smallest possible resource allocation
and within the shortest timeframe.

329
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:30,044
It's about finding the sweet spot
where you meet the customer's

330
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,715
needs without creating unnecessary
complexity or burden on the team.

331
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:39,245
Business leaders, they focus on
driving company strategic vision

332
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:43,404
and ensuring profitability and
fostering long term growth.

excites you, but only benefits a small
group of advanced users, or focus on
