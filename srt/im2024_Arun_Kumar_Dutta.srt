1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,319
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,990
I am Arun Kumar Dutta.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,489
Currently, I'm working as an
associate director in LTI Mindtree.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:12,020
Welcome to Incident Management
2024 powered by Conf42.

5
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:16,129
Today, I will be talking about
sustainability with performance

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,659
and resiliency testing.

7
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,309
Let me share my screen.

8
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:26,619
from agenda perspective, today I will
talk about sustainability and then I

9
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:28,699
will talk about what is carbon footprint.

10
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:34,604
Then we'll talk about Why sustainability
is so important to information

11
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:39,134
technology And then I'll talk about
sustainability with performance

12
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:43,134
and resiliency testing as I am a
performance tester by profession, right?

13
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:48,334
And then I'll talk about how
performance and resiliency testing

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:54,134
In with web performance optimizations
assist in sustainability.

15
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:58,284
Lastly, I will discuss on how
performance and resiliency testing

16
00:00:58,284 --> 00:01:02,484
assist to improve sustainability
post digital transformation.

17
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:05,014
Before I start, let me introduce myself.

18
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:09,869
I have been into industry for
last 19 years doing performance

19
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,599
and resiliency testing.

20
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:17,464
I have almost 22 plus testing conferences,
12 plus of global webinars, and

21
00:01:17,464 --> 00:01:21,049
72 plus of blog articles have been
published, and most of them are into

22
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,229
performance and resiliency testing field.

23
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:26,789
Also received many global
and organizational awards.

24
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,139
Let's understand what is sustainability.

25
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:35,589
Sustainability is nothing but meeting
our own needs without affecting

26
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:37,229
the future generation needs.

27
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:41,639
Yes, we all have to think
about our future generations.

28
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,159
Sustainability is not just
the environment, but also

29
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:49,119
it has other dimensions.

30
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,359
Like sustainability has three pillars.

31
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,734
environment, economy and society.

32
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:58,114
Sustainability assist
in many different ways.

33
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:02,724
You talked about creating a healthier
environment, you talked about

34
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:06,614
energy consumption, you talked
about employment, economy, you

35
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:08,844
talked about, good public health.

36
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:11,334
All this comes from the sustainability.

37
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:15,254
Sustainability helps in creating
a better future for all of us.

38
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:19,399
And we have all have to remember.

39
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,729
Sustainability is not a single person job.

40
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:25,969
It is everyone responsibility.

41
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:31,379
All of us has a role
To for sustainability.

42
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,349
No matter what do we do or
what background we came from.

43
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:35,829
I

44
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,989
will say like time has already come.

45
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,729
and we all need to think about if
you are not already started, right?

46
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:49,219
That about the sustainability and reducing
the carbon put free into the society.

47
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,169
And this will lead to a
better, sustainable environment

48
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:53,639
for our future generations.

49
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,379
So as I talking about reduce your
carbon footprint, let's understand

50
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,139
what is carbon footprint, right?

51
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:06,399
Carbon footprint is the total
amount of greenhouse gases that

52
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:09,079
are created by all of our actions.

53
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:13,349
So when I say greenhouse gases, I
was meaning mostly carbon dioxide and

54
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,899
Methane gases, but there are some other
gases also in terms of the greenhouse.

55
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:23,509
If you like, ozone could be one, nitrous
oxide could be one, or maybe hydro

56
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,199
fluorocarbons could be one or hydro
chlorofluorocarbons could be one, right?

57
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:33,599
So these all greenhouse gases are
actually not good for our society.

58
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,619
The more it gets emitted, the more
harmful to the society, right?

59
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,566
And people's products,
organizations, industry, everybody

60
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:45,439
is having a carbon footprint.

61
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,439
So we all have to think about it.

62
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:52,109
And your carbon footprint
includes all your daily actions.

63
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,909
Like how, what do you do in
your day to day life, right?

64
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:00,059
How you commute, what is the food
you take, what are the clothes that

65
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:05,859
you buy, you wear, the devices that
you use, everything you throw away.

66
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:07,309
All your daily actions.

67
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:10,269
Everything comes under
the carbon footprint.

68
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,999
So overall, what I'm trying to
say is that larger the carbon

69
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:21,569
footprint, the heavier it is for the
our society or environment, right?

70
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,449
So you all have to think about reducing
your carbon footprint and which is

71
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:31,019
better for our environment and it is
better for our future generations.

72
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:38,124
And if we all think about our daily action
in such a way that it is having a little

73
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:43,054
less carbon footprint, then eventually
it will be a huge, means it can create

74
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:44,864
a huge sustainable environment for us.

75
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:47,964
If we all start thinking about
in that direction, right?

76
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:53,344
Now sustainability is very important
to IT or our information technology

77
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:56,574
because we all people are from
belongs to the IT industry, right?

78
00:04:57,034 --> 00:05:01,904
And if you closely look into the
information technology business, right?

79
00:05:02,284 --> 00:05:08,884
We have Lot of servers, lot of server
forms, many devices, hundreds, thousands,

80
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:12,064
or even nowadays, like for iot cities,
like millions of devices, right?

81
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:18,054
And all these devices or servers or
server forms or whatever it is, right?

82
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:22,284
Basically it takes lot, tons,
or tons of resources, right?

83
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:26,144
And think about how much energy.

84
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:31,354
It requires to, to ensure all these
servers and devices are working, right?

85
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:36,214
And then think about the immense
greenhouse gases that are emitted

86
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:37,994
from those devices or servers.

87
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:43,364
And lastly, and most importantly, this
device generates a huge hit, especially

88
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:45,529
for the traditional data centers, right?

89
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:47,759
That they generate huge amount of heat.

90
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,759
So additional energy is required
to cool down those devices

91
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,019
or those equipments, right?

92
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:58,019
So overall it has a
massive sustainable impact.

93
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:03,089
And today, all people are
talking about it, right?

94
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:06,999
Internet is the biggest place for
the carbon footprint and it is

95
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:09,429
having the huge environmental impact.

96
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:12,604
Everybody is now connected
into the Internet, right?

97
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:17,604
And now, we are in an age where we are
not even talking about the only Internet.

98
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:19,524
We are talking about
the Internet of Things.

99
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:21,304
We are talking about AI.

100
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:23,054
We are talking about JAD GPT.

101
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:26,404
All these have a vast, sustainable impact.

102
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:28,234
And we have to think about it.

103
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:34,449
It is like a You cannot even
keep your keep silent, right?

104
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:35,889
You have to do something, right?

105
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,899
So what we have to do is the
organization and individual must think

106
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:45,329
about the sustainability to reduce
the carbon footprint to the society.

107
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:49,909
And we all it professionals
should work in such a way.

108
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:57,289
Think in such a way that we can make it as
sustainable or we can make it as green or

109
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:59,599
maybe like we can think about a green it.

110
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,479
And that's why we all
have to think about it.

111
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:05,759
If we had to think about
our future generations.

112
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:13,859
Now if you are new to this, sustainability
concept, I will recommend you guys to

113
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:20,004
go through, Two free courses, one by
Green Software Foundation and Linux

114
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:21,734
Foundation and one by Microsoft.

115
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:26,334
Green Software Foundation course is LFC
131 Green Software for Practitioners

116
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:30,364
and Microsoft course name is Principle
and Sustainable Software Engineering.

117
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,534
These are free courses,
but these are very good.

118
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:36,424
That means I personally went
through both the courses and it's

119
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:40,304
very, very well, um, documented.

120
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:41,314
I can say that way, right?

121
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:43,284
And still it's not the only two.

122
00:07:43,284 --> 00:07:43,504
There are.

123
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:46,264
Plenty of other, free and paid courses.

124
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:47,434
You can go through that also.

125
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,544
There are a lot of blogs.

126
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:49,574
There are forums.

127
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:52,764
if you wanted to learn,
it is absolutely required.

128
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:53,964
you can go through those things.

129
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:54,204
Okay.

130
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:59,094
But what all we're trying to say, or
maybe what I'm trying to portray with

131
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:02,564
this particular slide is, We all I.

132
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:02,744
T.

133
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:07,704
Professionals would think about the green
ideas and we should, learn this concept.

134
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:09,404
We should play a role.

135
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:13,614
Maybe like I can say, like a active
role to reduce the carbon between to the

136
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:19,694
society and make this world a sustainable
places for our future generations.

137
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:25,474
Now let's talk about the, the,
how performance and resiliency is

138
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:27,514
actually related to sustainability.

139
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:32,324
So as I am a performance tester and
resilience tester by profession, I'm

140
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:37,314
always inclined towards seats and
knowingly or unknowingly, if you are

141
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:42,264
doing performance testing and conducting
resiliency testing, then basically

142
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:44,544
you are helping in sustainability.

143
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:48,714
Let's understand how, how, It
basically does in two ways.

144
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:53,539
First, Performance and resiliency
testing always helps in making the

145
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,839
applications or website faster, right?

146
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:00,999
The moment the applications of the
website is faster, it uses less

147
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,589
data to serve the request, right?

148
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,109
And eventually it generates
less Carbon to the environment.

149
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,999
So it actually helps
in reducing the carbon.

150
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:12,389
Okay.

151
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:17,479
On the second approach, it actually
performance and resiliency testing.

152
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:20,809
There are the other thought is
like, it always helps in optimizing

153
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:22,149
the server resources, right?

154
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:26,829
so if the server resources are
optimized, then it consume less

155
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:31,369
energy and which is better for our
sustainable perspective, right?

156
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:34,549
So both ways, performance and
resiliency testing helps in.

157
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:39,929
Right now, in a nutshell, what I'm
trying to say is like by conducting

158
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:44,999
continuous performance and resiliency
testing, carbon footprint will be reduced

159
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,909
and sustainability will be improved.

160
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:49,359
Now let's understand in both ways.

161
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:53,019
So yeah, either it could be your,
your data center is an on premises

162
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,379
or it could be in the cloud, right?

163
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:59,279
So if it is a on premises, traditional
data center does not have the

164
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:03,329
flexibility to scale up or down easily.

165
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:08,984
But it can always ensures optimal service
server resource utilization, right?

166
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:13,174
And how that will be done, that will
be done via conducting continuous

167
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:14,794
performance and resiliency testing.

168
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:19,454
In fact, there are other ways also,
you can think about optimized resource

169
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:23,524
driven, high availability concept
nowadays, application containerizations

170
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:27,724
are there, but ultimately all this
leads to reducing the carbon footprint.

171
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:28,884
That is what I'm trying to say.

172
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:33,364
Now, if you think about the cloud,
cloud itself is a sustainable.

173
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:35,794
And it is having a less carbon footprint.

174
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:39,784
It has the flexibility to
add or, not maybe reduce the

175
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,524
environment as and when required.

176
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,994
And it is shared by many teams.

177
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:46,014
and, the most important it
uses green and clean energy.

178
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:47,354
So all these are actually.

179
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:52,864
from a sustainability perspective and
what I will say like over the years,

180
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:57,004
last year, especially for the last few
years, we have seen many traditional data

181
00:10:57,004 --> 00:11:01,044
centers are nowadays using green energy,
which is better for our environment.

182
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:07,304
So overall, our objective is to
minimize the wastage and optimize

183
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:12,664
the resources as much as possible
so that it can be more sustainable.

184
00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:19,394
It can reduce the carbon footprint
to the And we all can do this by

185
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:23,634
doing or conducting continuous
performance and resiliency testing.

186
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:28,634
And in, in cloud, you can think about
the sustainable capacity planning.

187
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,774
So these are the ways you
can think about it, right?

188
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:37,984
Now I'll talk about one more thing, like
web performance optimization, right?

189
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:40,764
We performance people are very
much interested about it, right?

190
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:44,764
We always talked about the web performance
optimization and web performance

191
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:48,444
optimization actually helps in,
reducing the carbon footprint, right?

192
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:53,404
as I said in, last slide,
there are two ways it does, the

193
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:54,934
helps in sustainability, right?

194
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:58,594
the first one I said is if your
application is faster, it uses

195
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:02,464
less data to solve the request
and eventually it will, omit or

196
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:04,194
less carbon footprint, right?

197
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:09,934
So optimizing web pages or web
performance optimization is one such

198
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:14,664
activity, which can help into, using,
your application faster, right?

199
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:15,254
The moment.

200
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:20,364
So you can think about, web performance
optimization by both ways, like whether

201
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,284
it is a client side or a server side.

202
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:26,024
In the client side, you can think about,
you can think about reducing the initial

203
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:31,464
page load time or javascript that runs
behind the browser or maybe downloading

204
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:33,414
all the resources and many more, right?

205
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:37,204
There are a lot of other ways also you
can do in the in terms of server side,

206
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,204
there will be much more concept, right?

207
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:44,274
You can think about optimizing your
web servers, app server or DB server.

208
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:47,254
You can think about,
improving your DB queries.

209
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:50,744
You can think about, optimizing
your other application dependencies

210
00:12:50,744 --> 00:12:52,314
or third party, components, right?

211
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:56,719
And there are a lot of best practices
also available, like you can think about,

212
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:01,549
caching, you can think about, content
delivery networks, you can think about

213
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:07,329
minification or maybe syncing your file
sizes, you can think about optimizing

214
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:12,219
your images, you can think about,
replication dependencies or optimizing

215
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:14,669
the most business critical web pages.

216
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:20,154
Which is in terms of your user loads
and maybe like the business function or

217
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:24,894
maybe like you can reduce the number of
resources in the web pages itself, right?

218
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:31,014
So all these are different ways to
reducing the overall page response time.

219
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:35,549
The moment your page response time is
It's less, it becomes faster, right?

220
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:40,719
And when your application is faster, it
emits less data, less carbon footprint

221
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:42,929
to the less carbon to the society, right?

222
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,639
which is better for
our environment, right?

223
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:50,959
web performance optimization is actually
helps in, reducing the carbon footprint.

224
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,699
Now, before I talked about the
post digital transformation, let

225
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:59,469
me tell you a different aspects of
performance and resiliency testing.

226
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:05,469
So while performance and resiliency
testing assist in sustainability,

227
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:11,219
however, too many performance testing
or too many resiliency testing leads

228
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:14,549
to a creates higher carbon footprint.

229
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:18,854
So let's say you can think about any
types of performance testing, whether

230
00:14:18,854 --> 00:14:22,139
it's a load, whether it's a stress,
whether it's endurance, whether it's

231
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,519
a, capacity planning, or there is
a volume or maybe like whether it's

232
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,269
your game day testing or any kind of
resiliency testing scenarios, right?

233
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:36,219
All of these are actually driven by
higher workload and higher resource

234
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:39,439
utilization, because performance
testing does for that only.

235
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,919
Testing does for that only, right?

236
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:46,059
So it all leads to hired or
maybe like huge workload.

237
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:49,199
The moment it is having huge
load, that means it creates

238
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,629
a higher carbon footprint.

239
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:55,379
So too many performance testing
or too many resiliency testing

240
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,749
is also not good for the thing.

241
00:14:57,749 --> 00:14:59,289
So you have to think about it.

242
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:04,109
You have to reduce the resiliency testing.

243
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,899
And I wrote LinkedIn article
on this specific topic.

244
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:08,189
Okay.

245
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:10,974
So organizations should
start thinking about it.

246
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:14,934
Now let's talk about the
digital transformation.

247
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:19,494
So while we in the terms of when we
are doing the digital transformation

248
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:23,644
more organized and moving towards the
cloud and then doing all this digital

249
00:15:24,144 --> 00:15:28,434
transformation activity, their whole
objective was to optimum the performance

250
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:31,414
and optimum the utilizations, right?

251
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:35,634
So that they can make their end
user first happy and then by

252
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,044
doing that, they can also save.

253
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,469
Cost and ensuring the
sustainability, right?

254
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:46,899
But post digital transformation,
organizations are more interested in less

255
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:49,559
carbon footprint at every stages of SDLC.

256
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:56,449
Okay, software development, life
cycle activities and which leads to.

257
00:15:57,304 --> 00:16:01,434
More cost savings, which leads to better
for our future generations, right?

258
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:07,154
But they are all doing it in post digital
transformation without comprising the

259
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:10,614
quality attributes, because quality
attributes still plays a major role

260
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:12,924
for post digital transformation.

261
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:14,934
So you have to think about it, right?

262
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:19,864
And the moment we are talking about the
sustainability aspect, with performance

263
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:24,969
and resiliency testing, Post digit and
I think the organization should think

264
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:31,459
about, maybe, at least 10, 10 points that
I have, wrote down in a form of a article.

265
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,239
so I'll come up with
those 10 points, right?

266
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:40,539
So first and foremost, Any unnecessary
or unplanned performance or resiliency

267
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:46,519
testing should be strictly avoided if
you are doing full blown and performance

268
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,149
testing and resiliency testing in a
very low scalable environment or your

269
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:55,489
hardware or software configuration
doesn't match with your live environment

270
00:16:55,739 --> 00:17:01,069
then please do not do that performance
or resiliency testing it will not help

271
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:04,829
you in neither you are going to get the
correct performance test result which

272
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:10,399
you can compare or It is not helpful
for the sustainability perspective.

273
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:16,389
So both of these are not only helps
in reducing the carbon footprint,

274
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:21,539
but it also helps in efforts as well
as in cost because that conducting

275
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:26,049
performance and resiliency takes a
lot of efforts and cost as well as

276
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,109
now organization.

277
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:32,424
Should not conduct full blown
performance testing frequently

278
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:34,294
like the earlier days is right.

279
00:17:34,324 --> 00:17:37,564
We used to do full blown performance
testing all the time, right?

280
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:41,754
So you are what I'm saying
is you should not avoid it.

281
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:44,714
But what I'm saying is you should
do it in periodically, right?

282
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:48,764
And also performance
environment should be smaller.

283
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,299
When you are not doing the full blown
performance testing, when you are doing

284
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:56,689
component level performance testing that
you do all the time, right component

285
00:17:56,689 --> 00:18:00,209
level performance testing, you set
up a baseline, you set up a benchmark

286
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:04,069
for your component level performance
testing compared the when you have a new

287
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:09,199
release comes, you Compare the results
with that lower environment itself.

288
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,479
And if your lower environment doesn't
prove you it is good, then you know,

289
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:15,559
there's no point of going into a full
blown performance testing, right?

290
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:21,759
So basically, you are not only doing
big performance testing or full

291
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:23,209
blown performance testing list.

292
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,639
Your environment size
is also getting reduced.

293
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,339
So that is a practice
of green testing, right?

294
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,459
So that you can also think about, right?

295
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,009
And.

296
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:36,694
You do only full blown performance
testing as and when required,

297
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:39,074
required and for, periodically.

298
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:43,504
And it is not only helps in saving
the, the cost, but also in, in

299
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:44,814
terms of the sustainability.

300
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:50,294
And time duration of the performance
testing should be also less.

301
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:53,254
if you're running two hour load
test, try to run it for one hour.

302
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:56,314
If you are running a long
duration endurance test, think

303
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:57,524
about, people run it for.

304
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,329
16 to 24 hours, 48 hours
of endurance testing.

305
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:03,349
You do that, but you do that periodically.

306
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:07,449
And in, in terms of, if it has
to be done, many times, then you

307
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,109
think about doing it for hours.

308
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,609
So that will be leading to the less
carbon footprint to the society.

309
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:18,129
So I think the, The workload you
can even think about not always you

310
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:19,529
have to run with the peak workload.

311
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:22,109
You can run with your
average workload also.

312
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:23,509
So think those aspects.

313
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:29,689
And now the best part is if your test
duration, performance is duration

314
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:34,639
is reduced and your workload is
also to some extent reduced, you

315
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:37,139
don't have to create a huge set of.

316
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,649
Performance chase data, right?

317
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:42,399
So your performance chase data
activities will be also less, right?

318
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:46,089
So that will also help you in
terms of the, the reducing or

319
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:47,709
minimizing the carbon footprint.

320
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:53,269
In fact, when your workload is
reduced, your, load generator, count

321
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:56,689
the machine or maybe like the load
injector count will be less, right?

322
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:00,799
Load generator are load injectors are the
machines which generates the load, right?

323
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:03,024
the moment, you'll be having a less walk.

324
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:05,994
load or you are not running it
for longer duration, you can go

325
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:07,644
with only single machines, right?

326
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:12,734
On those cases, your overall carbon
footprint will be again reduced, right?

327
00:20:12,734 --> 00:20:16,724
It actually helps him and try
to use a cloud load generator

328
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,904
because it will help him.

329
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:21,834
Rather than the traditional setup.

330
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:25,494
So that also helps to some
extent in sustainability, right?

331
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:31,054
So overall what i'm trying to say in
post digital transformation when you are

332
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:36,679
talking about performance and resiliency
testing you should think about a Overall

333
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:45,109
impact based, low volume, short duration,
specific goal oriented performance and

334
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:50,469
resiliency testing, which is not only
helpful in terms of the cost, which is

335
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:56,339
not only helpful for the organization
to get, or maybe like to ensure that end

336
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:02,899
users will be happy or maybe ensure end
user happiness and then, it will also

337
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,359
better for our sustainable environment.

338
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,809
You can also think about
conducting performance and

339
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,009
resiliency testing at off hours.

340
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,019
this will lead to a less
carbon footprint, right?

341
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:21,749
And even a green testing techniques
like optimizing the performance

342
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,309
test scenario will assist in
reducing the carbon footprint.

343
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:31,849
And if you are using the on premises, on
premises, then try to use your existing

344
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,859
hardware for a longer duration, right?

345
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:38,019
So this is basically the expanding
the hardware lifespans, right?

346
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:39,909
Which helps in, carbon footprint.

347
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:44,839
And if you are using it for a long
duration, your u waste will be also less.

348
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:47,509
So that is also good for
the perspective, right?

349
00:21:48,864 --> 00:21:53,074
In fact, you can evaluate your
power consumption on the background

350
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:57,724
applications or the mobiles,
laptops, devices, servers, right?

351
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:03,304
And if you can actually possible,
you can minimize that, the bad,

352
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:04,744
those power consumption, right?

353
00:22:04,774 --> 00:22:07,834
Which is another way of, doing
the, sustainability, right?

354
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:14,754
So and I'll also suggest organizers
would continuously look for reducing

355
00:22:14,754 --> 00:22:16,174
the amount of data transfer.

356
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:19,164
So and then, the distance they work.

357
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:22,334
If they do that, their
web pages will be faster.

358
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:26,114
And then when their web page is
faster, their end users will be happy.

359
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:31,024
In fact, the organization can start
using the emulator instead of the real

360
00:22:31,344 --> 00:22:35,074
devices, because we all always do a lot
of mobile performance testing, right?

361
00:22:35,074 --> 00:22:38,604
On those cases, it is better to
use the emulator, which is having

362
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:41,474
the less carbon footprint rather
than using the real devices.

363
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:47,624
And if you are, no, if you wanted
to do the rewired devices, then you

364
00:22:47,644 --> 00:22:49,964
must think about the device lifespan.

365
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:51,744
It has to be increased.

366
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:55,154
The moment it will be increased, it
will be better for the environment.

367
00:22:55,864 --> 00:23:00,934
So overall, in post digital
transformation, organizations should be

368
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:07,324
conducting performance testing in, so they
had to do continuous performance testing,

369
00:23:07,324 --> 00:23:09,624
but they had to think in a different way.

370
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:15,534
Now they have to do it in
test early and test only.

371
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,269
When it is required rather than earlier
days when you used to talk about test

372
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:26,169
always or test often I think that has been
changed in post digital transformation

373
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:27,609
that we all have to remember it

374
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,929
This is a blog that I was talking
about performance and resiliency

375
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:35,249
testing for improved sustainability
post digital transformation

376
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,339
The links are available.

377
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:42,660
There are a few other blogs articles
that i've already published Like

378
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,209
one of them is in euro star.

379
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:50,644
This one is a global testing
You retread from Agile testing.

380
00:23:51,244 --> 00:23:55,424
these two are from Quality Matters
magazine, sustainable capacity planning

381
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:58,354
and application performance sustainability
with auto scaling and thought,

382
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,114
and then organization need to
be very serious when conducting

383
00:24:02,114 --> 00:24:03,514
full blown performance testing.

384
00:24:03,524 --> 00:24:05,434
That's the LinkedIn article
I was talking about.

385
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:10,184
And this was a very old article
I published in 2020 application

386
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:13,904
do not run fast in cloud with
continuous performance testing.

387
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:15,659
All links are available.

388
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,749
You can go through those, articles,
as and when you have time.
