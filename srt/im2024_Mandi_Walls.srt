1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,430
All right, thanks for
listening to my, presentation.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,990
it's nice to be back at
another CONF42 event.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,250
this is Managing Vendor Incidents.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,995
things you can do when you're Vendors
have an incident or an outage.

5
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:15,584
I am Mandi Walls.

6
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:18,475
I am a DevOps advocate at PagerDuty.

7
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:19,884
you can get in touch with me.

8
00:00:19,884 --> 00:00:23,924
I'm LNXCHK on most social media things.

9
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:25,665
Not really on X.

10
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:26,604
com anymore.

11
00:00:26,784 --> 00:00:27,754
you can find me on Blue Sky.

12
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:31,984
If you are totally old school and you
want to email me, I'm mwalls at pagerduty.

13
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:34,214
com or you can join our community site.

14
00:00:34,374 --> 00:00:37,694
We just relaunched it
in September of 2024.

15
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:40,154
It's brand new and that is community.

16
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:40,294
pagerduty.

17
00:00:40,964 --> 00:00:41,264
com.

18
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:44,834
That's as much PagerDuty
as I'm going to talk about.

19
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:47,904
if you'd like to talk PagerDuty,
I'd love to hear from you.

20
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:48,894
Go ahead and get in touch.

21
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:53,754
What I am going to talk about
is vendor incidents, because

22
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,144
they're everywhere, right?

23
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:58,274
And there's reason for that, right?

24
00:00:58,294 --> 00:01:03,334
One of the first key tenets or
mantras of cloud computing was

25
00:01:03,624 --> 00:01:05,694
you own your own availability.

26
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:10,219
If you look for that, search for that on
your search engine of choice, You should

27
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:17,669
find a post by John Allspaugh on his
Kitchen Soap blog from like 2013, I think.

28
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:18,489
It's old, right?

29
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:19,549
It's been out for a while.

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,079
But the idea is being that, your
cloud providers are making this

31
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:26,999
infrastructure and all these
great services available to you.

32
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:32,849
And then you and your organization has
to decide what to use, how to use it in

33
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,349
order to meet your organization's goals.

34
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:40,104
Your cloud provider They don't have
any knowledge of your KPIs, they just

35
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:43,054
know you've got something going on
and you're paying them for it, right?

36
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:48,194
over the last 10 to 15 ish years,
more organizations have become

37
00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:51,124
increasingly reliant on cloud computing.

38
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:52,654
Because it's great, right?

39
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:57,715
you've got the ability to focus on
the things that your business does

40
00:01:57,715 --> 00:02:01,495
that sets you apart, and not having
to worry about all of the other

41
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:03,355
stuff that goes into your tech stack.

42
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:06,850
you fire up some stuff
on your cloud vendor.

43
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,490
And it just appears, you don't
have to wait for provisioning

44
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,160
and tickets and purchase orders.

45
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,920
And maybe you had to do reverse
auctions and all that kind

46
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,840
of stuff back in the day.

47
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,770
And you spent Hundreds of
thousands of dollars on

48
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,650
equipment for your applications.

49
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,910
And you had to wait six to
eight weeks before they'd even

50
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,400
arrive at the data center.

51
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,049
And then they had to be racked and
stacked and networked and powered

52
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,230
up and all that great stuff.

53
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,459
And it would take forever.

54
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:34,530
And now it's much less friction, right?

55
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,610
You can Add the functionality you need
without all of that stress and to a

56
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,670
certain extent without a lot of the
hassle like if you were around in those

57
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:51,950
days 20, 2006 or so and you wanted
a large, reliable traffic shaper and

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,980
firewall kind of device, 40 grand, right?

59
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,140
Things have moved along, but that means
that you are accepting a certain amount of

60
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,280
risk for how your vendors run their stuff.

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,550
And sometimes, most of
the time, it's great.

62
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,640
You, things just run.

63
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,880
They're just, they're gonna be there,
you're gonna click on them, you're

64
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,690
gonna do the job that you need to
do, and they're up all the time.

65
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,200
But things do happen, right?

66
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,940
There is, there's risk, right?

67
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:24,485
Cloud providers have experienced outages,
sometimes due to configuration errors.

68
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,285
It does pop up.

69
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:28,265
sometimes due to, denial
of service attacks.

70
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:29,695
Those also come up.

71
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:33,845
And even other, the catastrophic problems.

72
00:03:34,065 --> 00:03:37,645
if you recognize this photo, it
was the OVH cloud data center that

73
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:40,285
burned in Stroudsburg in 2021.

74
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:42,025
the data center was a total loss.

75
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:43,895
Those machine rooms
were completely gutted.

76
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,625
fire started in a battery.

77
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,090
And it just ate the entire data center.

78
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,570
there's a fire truck in the foreground,
but if you look closely, the stream

79
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,880
of water that is in the background
is coming from an actual boat that

80
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,130
was a fire boat that was fire,
fighting the fire with them as well.

81
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,730
yeah, absolute disaster for folks
who didn't have other plans.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,440
it's still annoying for folks
that did and could get out.

83
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,260
and we know lots of folks who did.

84
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:07,529
yeah, that's it.

85
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,980
Those are rare, but they do happen.

86
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,390
What happens more often are smaller
errors, hiccups, other problems,

87
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,860
and we can learn to deal with
those a little bit better too.

88
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,020
your organization has accepted
that you own your availability.

89
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,160
The things that matter to your customers,
the services that you provide, the

90
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,870
products that you make available,
don't really matter to your vendors.

91
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,256
They matter, in that we
want you to be successful.

92
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:33,594
Bye!

93
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:37,135
It's not that we don't care, it's
just that we don't necessarily

94
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:38,495
know exactly what you're doing.

95
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:44,435
Your vendors have a lot of customers, and
your business is your business, and you

96
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:46,235
know what's going on there best, right?

97
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:48,975
Your vendor recognizes that
you've got work happening.

98
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:51,215
They might even ask you
to do a case study, right?

99
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:53,125
That's awesome, you want
to participate in that.

100
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:55,535
But your services are your services.

101
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:59,775
Your vendors, Whether it's your cloud
provider, another SaaS provider, they're

102
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:02,185
just your landlord on the internet, right?

103
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:05,715
So you need your own insurance and
your own way of dealing with things,

104
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:07,575
when your landlord has a boo, right?

105
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:09,495
so you're answerable to your customers.

106
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:14,215
You're, as a customer, Then your
vendors, the folks that you use, should

107
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:16,625
be answerable to you as well, right?

108
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,385
You should have that
relationship with them.

109
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:21,985
So we're going to talk about being a
good vendor customer and how that's

110
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:25,595
going to help us deal with, working
through these issues and things when

111
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:26,995
incidents happen on our vendors.

112
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:31,395
So the first thing we want to do is
take stock of our vendors and I'm going

113
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:36,135
to suggest a sort of organizational
strategy to approaching this, but I know

114
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,695
that you have lots and lots of vendors.

115
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:42,435
You open up your authentication
authorization platform and you

116
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:46,135
have like dozens and dozens of
tiles of different applications

117
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,450
that you might have access to.

118
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,930
I open ours and I have no idea
what some of this stuff is.

119
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,330
I know it's for other teams, maybe in
my department, but I don't have any,

120
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,520
role in the things that they're doing,
but the stuff is there just because we

121
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,980
happen to belong to this department.

122
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,480
there's just so much stuff that
you might potentially need to be

123
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,220
thinking about in the course of
preparing for a vendor outage.

124
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,090
So we're going to classify them a
little bit to make them a little

125
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,000
bit easier to manage and easier to
think about and easier to prioritize.

126
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,910
especially when we see things like.

127
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:20,185
vendor outages, to a greater or lesser
degree, depending on the functionality.

128
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:23,155
I've arbitrarily decided
to call them tiers.

129
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:26,195
You can pick whatever classification
you'd that makes sense to you.

130
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:30,175
We use, severity and priority
for dealing with incidents.

131
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:33,825
this, we didn't want to pull
that, Sort of priority part in,

132
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:34,895
because it would be confusing.

133
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:39,325
if you are familiar with networking, and
internetworking, your tier one providers,

134
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:40,735
they are going to be your backbone folks.

135
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:41,735
the same idea.

136
00:06:42,355 --> 00:06:48,835
Your tier one folks, are the
directly customer facing components.

137
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:52,055
Things that are in support
of your production systems.

138
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:54,455
It's going to be your
infrastructure as a service.

139
00:06:54,835 --> 00:06:55,555
Obviously.

140
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:59,245
It's maybe going to be shopping
cart and payments providers,

141
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:00,335
if you're outsourcing that.

142
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:01,805
Hopefully you are.

143
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:03,615
No one wants to write
their own payments library.

144
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:05,065
It might be search.

145
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:07,665
We outsource some of that
for parts of our site.

146
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:12,565
and also things that you're going to need
if something goes wrong on your side.

147
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:14,085
Metrics, monitoring, alerting.

148
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:20,015
Things that if you have an incident
or an outage on your systems, you

149
00:07:20,015 --> 00:07:22,855
want those folks to definitely
be available at that time.

150
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:27,605
So they're all sort of production
touching, related to the customer

151
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:29,875
experience for your customers, right?

152
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:33,885
in a way, a Tier 1 provider
outage or an incident on their

153
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:38,065
components might actually mean a
revenue hit for your organization.

154
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:42,995
If you are at a point where you can
actually codify how much it would cost

155
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:47,805
you for, say, a minute or ten minutes
of outage in the main major components,

156
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:49,415
you want to make a note of that as well.

157
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:54,275
Not everyone has that granularity, or has
that kind of understanding, or has that

158
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:57,655
sort of predictability in their revenue
stream, but if you do have that and

159
00:07:57,665 --> 00:07:59,315
you know, then you can mark that down.

160
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,450
Tier twos.

161
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,450
These are part of your build
and test processes, right?

162
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:10,240
The things that are like your QA
tools, CICD deployments, maybe some

163
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,140
infrastructure as code components, where
if they're not available, you're, it's

164
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,390
gonna slow you down in your solutions.

165
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,620
It might also be your source code
management and maybe even user

166
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,590
documentation and things like
that, that the customers use.

167
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,970
But on a less lesser basis, or if your
customers are mostly internal things

168
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,490
that they would also necessarily rely
on, but wouldn't necessarily, get in the

169
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,590
way of them finishing their work, right?

170
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,550
For example, so an incident on
a two tier, a tier two provider.

171
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:42,635
might not impact all of your customers
directly, but it could impact your

172
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:47,175
ability to then ship a fix if you have
an incident on those platforms, right?

173
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:52,405
So thinking about all the things
that impact your SDLC, all the

174
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:55,715
things that sort of get in the
way or are part of that workflow

175
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:57,865
are, important components of that.

176
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,765
So if I have an outage in my production
and I want to be able to push a

177
00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:04,105
fix for it, these are the things
that would be part of that process.

178
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,250
Tier 3 and below, if you'd like, are
additional tools, workflow components.

179
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,770
They're usually outside the workflow
to get things into production.

180
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,570
an incident on a Tier 3 provider
should not impede work on production.

181
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,010
So these are going to be anything
else that might come up, right?

182
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,870
lots of other tools that you
might have, lots of things that

183
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,550
might run in test occasionally,
other sort of provisioning things.

184
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:35,885
The system that builds new images
for you, whatever the case might

185
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:38,935
be, that you don't necessarily
have to fix things in production.

186
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:42,045
And then there's stuff that
might fall under other.

187
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:45,415
There's plenty of, you probably
have plenty of vendors and

188
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:52,205
providers that are other parts of
your incident response process.

189
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:55,835
You have, maybe your conference software.

190
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,020
your team chat, whatever that is,
internal docs, like your wikis, if

191
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,990
you're, purchasing that as a SaaS,
these are things that you may want to

192
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,290
note and have a backup plan for, right?

193
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,320
So we use PagerDuty,
we use Zoom and Slack.

194
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,210
We know if an incident happens when
those are down, we have a backup plan.

195
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,680
We go to somewhere, go somewhere
else, make sure that everyone has

196
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,420
accounts in those places and can get
to them and knows where they are.

197
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:26,225
Okay, I'm going to have a backup.

198
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:31,585
A lot of this stuff is probably owned by
IT, whereas many of the other systems,

199
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:37,954
probably the primary owner or decision
maker happens to be in the technical area.

200
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:41,825
organization rather than say
in IT, which often reports into

201
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,865
like your CFO or maybe a CIO.

202
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:46,585
So you may have different reporting
structures for how things are

203
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:48,255
billed and how they come in.

204
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:52,565
So if these are owned by IT for you,
they may already have a backup plan

205
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:57,155
or a run book or things like that,
that you can crib off of to figure out

206
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:59,355
how you want to manage your vendors.

207
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,485
If you have them for your
operational components.

208
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:04,215
Okay.

209
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,980
Note down all of your vendors.

210
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:14,900
We want to know who they are, the
things that our customers rely on,

211
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,590
that rely on our vendors, right?

212
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,950
for infrastructure as code,
everything they hit, obviously.

213
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,860
That's where those things go.

214
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,910
But it might be less obvious of which
parts, which components of those cloud

215
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,130
providers all of your services are using,
so make sure that we're noting that down.

216
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:36,635
Add them to your service diagrams.

217
00:11:36,955 --> 00:11:38,225
Sometimes they just don't appear.

218
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:40,515
There's like this nebulous
thing that kind of goes off the

219
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:42,785
diagram into the cloud somewhere.

220
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:45,535
But we want to know exactly
what services we're consuming.

221
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,790
So that if we do see how there's a
problem on this service, we know exactly

222
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,170
where that is, how it impacts our users.

223
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,400
So we can definitively say,
yes, we are seeing this degraded

224
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,860
behavior on our application.

225
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:02,580
We're waiting for the vendor
to, to respond and to be very,

226
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,010
structured about how that functions.

227
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,700
So we need to have that documentation
of knowing exactly where So customer

228
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,010
requests would come in and where that's
going to be impacted by a potential

229
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,750
third party vendor that we might have.

230
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,940
So noting where all of those
live in our ecosystem, super

231
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,740
important, doesn't always happen.

232
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,340
We also want to be very conscious of
building positive vendor relationships.

233
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,310
It's easy for me to say
this as a vendor, right?

234
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,840
But at the same time, like your
tier one vendors, you've declared

235
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,910
them as tier one because they're
important to your customers.

236
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,370
That's a kind of a big deal.

237
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,660
People are paying you for a service, and
you're paying someone else for a service.

238
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,920
You want to have those
positive relationships there.

239
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,330
For your Tier 1 vendors, the folks
that, if they have an incident,

240
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,030
it might impact your revenue,

241
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:03,020
consider buying up to a premium support
package if you don't already have one.

242
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,970
For a lot of vendors, if you spend X
number of dollars or euros or whatever,

243
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,150
you will get extended benefits.

244
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:12,135
a premium support package.

245
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,705
Not everyone does that
for all their vendors.

246
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,940
Totally makes sense.

247
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,330
You have a lot of vendors.

248
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,860
It's a lot of things to think about.

249
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,680
But for your Tier 1 providers, if
you don't have a large enough spend

250
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,300
based on the capacity that you're
purchasing, consider upping that

251
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,840
a little bit on the support side.

252
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,890
It's not because you expect to
need help with the implementation,

253
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,800
which is what a lot of people
sort of associate support with.

254
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,540
It's so you can access the VIP
relationships that you will

255
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,010
get with that vendor based on
that premium support contract.

256
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,470
I say it again.

257
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,020
You buy up to support, not because
you need help with the implementation,

258
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,560
but because you want a closer
relationship with the vendor.

259
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,200
Secrets, right?

260
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:56,870
Who knew?

261
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,740
Usually when that happens, you'll
get like an account manager.

262
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,930
You'll have more of a direct
line of contact with the vendor.

263
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,970
Almost none of us are big enough to
get this based on our spend with the

264
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,920
cloud providers, but you can buy up.

265
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,450
For a lot of these,
premium support contracts.

266
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,470
For all of your other vendors,
everybody's got something available.

267
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,760
Some of it's pretty affordable.

268
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,860
Sometimes you're like,
oh man, we don't know.

269
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,320
You really do need to run the numbers.

270
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,450
If they are down for X number of
minutes and it costs us this much of

271
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:34,300
revenue, 10 minutes of outage on their
side pays for the entire contract.

272
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,600
you want to run those numbers
and figure that out based on

273
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,720
how much you use of their stuff.

274
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,610
You also want to make sure you
are maintaining that relationship.

275
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,765
Have the calls that they want to have.

276
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:52,255
Often you'll get like an every four
to six week check in and yeah, it

277
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:55,405
might feel like a slog that like, Oh,
you feel like they're just going to

278
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:58,925
try and sell you something else, but
they're also there to listen, right?

279
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:02,605
To your concerns, to your problems,
the things that you want out

280
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:05,525
of them as a vendor, the things
you want out of their products.

281
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:07,995
It should be a two way relationship.

282
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:10,095
That's not what you're getting
from your account manager.

283
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:15,765
Talk to their boss, but, you want to have
this, very reciprocal relationship with

284
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:22,505
your Tier 1 providers so that you can be
first in line if something happens, right?

285
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:26,625
Have those calls so that they know
who you are, they have a personal

286
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:32,020
relationship with you, And they know,
hey, company X, they're a great customer,

287
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,620
and they're having a problem with this
particular feature, or they're seeing

288
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,490
this, do we have an incident running?

289
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,290
And you may be the customer
that reports an incident into

290
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,560
them, have that relationship.

291
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,830
It also helps to be helpful, right?

292
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,190
Think about the folks that are your
customers, and they say, oh, this thing

293
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,890
isn't working, and that's all they tell
you, and you're like, what isn't working?

294
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,690
What are you talking about?

295
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,700
Be helpful with your vendors, right?

296
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,250
Bug reports, feature
feedback, all of that stuff.

297
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,830
Anything that gets you more time
and attention in a positive way

298
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,500
from that vendor that gives you
a better relationship with them.

299
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,080
They might invite you to their customer
advocacy board, or they might invite

300
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,660
you to talk at their conferences,
or talk to their other customers,

301
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,170
or any of those kinds of things.

302
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,330
And that gives you a better
relationship, better term on that

303
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,195
vendor, so that If incidents do
happen, they're your friends, right?

304
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:27,975
They know who you are, you've talked
about your kids, all that great stuff.

305
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:30,405
And you have a more personal
relationship with them.

306
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,325
It's super helpful.

307
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:34,805
Because vendors are
going to have incidents.

308
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:37,685
Not all of them have them
all the time, for sure.

309
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:39,965
And not all of them have very large ones.

310
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:43,045
But, I happen to be
recording this on a Tuesday.

311
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,920
And yesterday, one of the big
wireless providers in the United

312
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,470
States had a massive outage.

313
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,080
We still don't know why, but it
was like nationwide is a mess.

314
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,870
My mom's like frantically calling me.

315
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,640
What's going on?

316
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,020
I'm like, it's Verizon.

317
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,610
It's not you.

318
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,530
My niece had to go find a
landline because my brother

319
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,750
doesn't have a landline anymore.

320
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,860
It was drama, right?

321
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,580
Like it happens.

322
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,560
So your vendor has an incident.

323
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,460
How does this come into you, right?

324
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,520
Your customers see a problem on your site.

325
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,850
They don't know that you have.

326
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,440
linked to some other provider for that
particular piece of functionality.

327
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,250
They have no idea what you're doing there.

328
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,260
Your team might be alerted
by PagerDuty as well.

329
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,140
Hopefully you've got monitoring and
it's saying, Hey, we're getting 500

330
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,230
errors back from this vendor, right?

331
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,810
We don't know if this
request is us or them.

332
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,730
So you start your incident response
process as you would for anything else

333
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,140
because right now it looks like it's a
vendor, it's having a problem, but we're

334
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,850
not sure, so we're going to investigate.

335
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,770
So we start our incident review
process, our incident process,

336
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:44,705
Everybody joins the Zoom call or the
Slack channel or wherever you are

337
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:47,295
and your engineers are investigating.

338
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:51,995
And as they unpeel all the layers in
your distributed system, it's yeah,

339
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:53,895
this does actually point to the vendor.

340
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,985
So you pull up the vendor's status
page and there's nothing there.

341
00:17:58,225 --> 00:17:59,555
now what do you do, right?

342
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:00,515
What's going to happen?

343
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:04,455
Hopefully, if you have had
that relationship with your

344
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:06,615
vendor, contact them directly.

345
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,190
You contact your account manager.

346
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,090
Hey, we're seeing this.

347
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,930
What are you guys seeing?

348
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,210
Or you've got a support line that you
can call or email or get in touch with.

349
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,870
Somebody that you have built this
relationship with over the past 12

350
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,270
months or whatever of your contract,
so that they know that you're

351
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,830
seeing a problem with their stuff.

352
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,270
Part of that will come down
to, over time, clarifying the

353
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,280
ownership of the relationship.

354
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,960
Because, especially if you are in
the enterprise, And you have to

355
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,970
go through like a purchase order
process or a procurement process.

356
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:43,000
Lots of people are interacting with your
vendors and it can become very unclear who

357
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,540
actually should be the one to reach out.

358
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,550
Who are the folks who know the vendor,
who have the relationship to the vendor,

359
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,950
who should have that relationship to
the vendor, who attends the QBR calls,

360
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,430
attends the monthly call with the account
manager, who those people are, right?

361
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,300
Because it can change over the
course of the relationship.

362
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,520
At the beginning You might have
procurement, they're the ones, somebody

363
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,460
has picked this product to use, and
they ship it over to procurement for

364
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,360
whatever lengthy process that they have.

365
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,820
you might have legal and finance
that are involved in the contract

366
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,870
negotiation process, all of that kind
of comes in, and that can be pretty

367
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,880
onerous depending on, where you
are, what kind of, process you have.

368
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:26,145
Once you get to implementation,
depending on the size of your

369
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:30,815
organization, you might have, program
managers or project managers who are

370
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:32,475
in charge of that implementation.

371
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:37,265
They sign teams up to get onboarded, they
make sure everybody has training, they get

372
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:42,495
everybody aligned, and they keep moving
through the process across the department.

373
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:45,485
Depending on the scope of the product,

374
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:52,155
catch all teams might own the relationship
after it's been implemented, right?

375
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:55,475
So depending on where you are in all
these phases, It might be somebody,

376
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:59,585
different who would reach out to
your vendor if there's an issue.

377
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:03,105
eventually you might get to a place
where, hopefully in most places you'll

378
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:07,375
get to a place where, some kind of
application team owns the primary part

379
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:12,325
of the relationship because they are the
main consumers of that vendor's products.

380
00:20:12,905 --> 00:20:17,085
For things like your app, Infrastructure
is a service and larger components

381
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:21,915
like that, it might fall to platform
engineering or SRE, or even call it a

382
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:25,825
DevOps team somewhere, and they own that
relationship because they're the ones that

383
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,915
interact with those components most often.

384
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,055
They're the ones making changes,
they have the administrative rights,

385
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:32,435
all of those kinds of things.

386
00:20:32,705 --> 00:20:35,905
You might have a DevTools team
for things like your CI, CD, and

387
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:39,485
deployment tools that own that
relationship, know where the accounts

388
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:40,925
are, and how everything is managed.

389
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:46,175
So depending on What the thing is and
who's consuming it, that's probably

390
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:51,325
who should own it from the perspective
of what do we do if there's a problem.

391
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:55,055
So when you are relying on a vendor
for something in your production

392
00:20:55,055 --> 00:21:02,625
environment, someone or some team,
hopefully, that has an on call

393
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:07,705
responsibility already, should be the
internal contact point for the vendor.

394
00:21:07,815 --> 00:21:08,875
Let me give you an example.

395
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:11,325
Let's say you've got like
some kind of retail site.

396
00:21:11,585 --> 00:21:15,670
You have an external shopping cart
provider that is going to help

397
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,520
you, main manage your, customer.

398
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,240
shipping and billing and
all those kinds of things.

399
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,120
So you have an external service for that.

400
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:29,010
Your main website has the content on
it and points out to the billing site

401
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,500
when people are ready to buy something.

402
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,250
The people who implemented that
integration between your website

403
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,960
and the external biller should be
the folks who are responsible if

404
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,650
something is wrong on the billing side.

405
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,950
They can talk to those people,
they know how it's implemented,

406
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,415
they should Hopefully 'cause most
likely they wrote most of it, right?

407
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:50,345
that's the kind of the point.

408
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:53,675
You wrote it, you run it, but
in this case you integrated with

409
00:21:53,675 --> 00:21:55,705
it, you know what's going wrong.

410
00:21:55,915 --> 00:22:00,045
They know where the logs are for the
code that consumes the external website.

411
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:02,655
So they're gonna be best placed to be
able to say, Hey, there's something

412
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,145
wrong on our external side here.

413
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:07,635
The vendor that we're using, they're
also the ones that are gonna be able

414
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:11,505
to say, Hey, it looks like everything
is good again, and we're all clear.

415
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,480
we don't want folks fumbling around.

416
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,950
This happens from time to time.

417
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,680
There's different components that
we have that are publicly facing,

418
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,080
say, our documentation site.

419
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,860
The regular engineering folks who are
on call for, the rest of our production

420
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,950
environment don't touch the main
components of the documentation site,

421
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,929
things that support documentation.

422
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,480
knowledge base, right?

423
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,710
The tech writers are the ones
who maintain that content.

424
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,840
They chose the platform that it runs on.

425
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,640
So if something happens on that platform,
like the search isn't running, or it's

426
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,320
not rendering correctly, or something
is going on, the rest of the engineering

427
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,030
team can't fix that for us, right?

428
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,986
We have to go to the tech writers and
say, hey, look, you guys know more

429
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:50,720
about this platform than any of us do.

430
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,890
You have the accounts to log
into their portal or whatever

431
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,280
and can tell us, how to fix this.

432
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,905
So you need to have The tech
writers in that example have an

433
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:04,945
on call responsibility because
it's a user facing site, right?

434
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:09,115
It faces external to your customers
So making sure that all those things

435
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:13,275
are covered and all those bases are
covered as you onboard a new vendor

436
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:19,105
relationship super important Just
making sure that If our customers

437
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:23,225
see it, it looks like us, but we're
using a vendor, someone on our side

438
00:23:23,255 --> 00:23:25,175
can take responsibility for it, right?

439
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:27,085
And maintain that relationship.

440
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:30,795
Part of that is going to come
down to creating vendor runbooks.

441
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:34,935
And your IT team may already
have something in place for

442
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:36,165
the things that they own.

443
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:41,085
If you don't have it as part of your tech
team, consider putting these together.

444
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:43,875
You might have some stuff that
looks a little bit like this.

445
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:45,855
It doesn't have all the stuff in it.

446
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,985
But it's good to have
all this as a baseline.

447
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:52,315
And definitely do this for
your Tier 1 and Tier 2 vendors.

448
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:56,105
The folks that are, in your revenue
stream, or are going to impact

449
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:59,865
your ability to ship a bug fix,
or fix an incident on your side.

450
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:01,875
Make them available to everyone.

451
00:24:01,885 --> 00:24:05,335
I know that sounds a little scary, right?

452
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:08,625
For folks who have a more
tied down procurement system.

453
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:12,750
But this, If there's an incident going
on at three o'clock in the morning, the

454
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,070
last thing you want to be needing to do
is call up some procurement person who

455
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,290
doesn't have an on call rotation, right?

456
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,670
So you're trying to find their phone
number, figure out who their boss

457
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,790
is, and all that kind of stuff.

458
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,030
We don't want to be doing any of that.

459
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:26,635
So some stuff to collect up.

460
00:24:27,555 --> 00:24:29,055
Account numbers and user IDs.

461
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:30,365
Super important.

462
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,415
That's how your vendor
knows who you are, right?

463
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:37,035
That's the piece of information that's
going to be able to tell them, Okay, this

464
00:24:37,205 --> 00:24:39,215
particular customer is having a problem.

465
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:42,355
It helps them triangulate
all the information about

466
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,835
their own incident as well.

467
00:24:44,045 --> 00:24:46,665
If they're looking at, Oh,
it's just customers on this

468
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,765
particular database, segment.

469
00:24:48,815 --> 00:24:52,205
Or it's just customers in this
region, geographical region,

470
00:24:52,215 --> 00:24:53,295
that are seeing this incident.

471
00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:56,315
They, that helps them pinpoint
all of that stuff, right?

472
00:24:56,515 --> 00:25:00,025
So you want to know exactly what your
account numbers, user IDs, however

473
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:03,225
they identify you as their customer.

474
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:04,245
have that.

475
00:25:05,215 --> 00:25:07,965
That may not necessarily be
all the logins, but you should

476
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:11,775
have those, at least the names
of them or the keys as well.

477
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:15,605
Some of that stuff is probably
in your vault and the part of the

478
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:19,315
having, I want to call responsibility
for the relationship owner is also

479
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:22,265
knowing where those things are in
the vault if you're not able to put

480
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:24,205
them in plain text somewhere, right?

481
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:26,975
So have those pointers
that people have access to.

482
00:25:27,265 --> 00:25:30,415
Because a lot of the times if you're
using an API or something like that.

483
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:35,865
You're consuming it and you're only using
some kind of token or API key to do that.

484
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:37,885
You want to make sure that
you know exactly what that is.

485
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:41,265
have the contact, your
contract information.

486
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:43,835
This seems a little weird,
but like it comes up, right?

487
00:25:44,205 --> 00:25:46,395
Know what feature set
you purchased, right?

488
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:48,835
Because the last thing you want
to do is like contact the vendor

489
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:49,851
and say, Hey, this isn't working.

490
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:51,765
And they're like, you
didn't buy that, right?

491
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:55,605
Make sure you know exactly what you bought
and you have it documented somewhere.

492
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:59,945
Because a lot of the folks that you're
dealing with are large vendors, they have

493
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:04,245
lots of different components, and you have
to subscribe to some stuff individually,

494
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:07,865
or to buy a package of particular
features, and all that kind of stuff.

495
00:26:07,885 --> 00:26:10,585
So save yourself some headache and
document what you bought, right?

496
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:11,075
So you know.

497
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:12,935
also your level of support.

498
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:16,135
So you know, I put a ticket in and
I haven't heard back in 30 minutes.

499
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:18,205
it's because you bought the
two hour support, right?

500
00:26:18,465 --> 00:26:22,535
I also have that documented, know your
email address, support phone number,

501
00:26:22,535 --> 00:26:26,815
support website, however you contact
those folks, as well as your dedicated

502
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:30,965
account manager, if you have a direct
line for them, or their email address,

503
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:36,030
or you share a slack channel with them,
they, in either direction, they're,

504
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,460
they have a channel in your slack,
or you have a channel in their slack.

505
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,140
Whatever the case might be, make sure you
document that so people can find things

506
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,000
as quickly as possible when an incident
indicates the vendor is having an issue.

507
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,190
Include the status of your
account and the renewal date.

508
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,830
Again, you don't want to be contacted by
the vendor and things aren't working and

509
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,700
find out that, Oh, your contract expired.

510
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,910
Making sure you're keeping
up on those things.

511
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,415
When your renewal date comes
around, They're probably telling

512
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:05,725
you about it in your monthly calls
or, quarterly calls with them.

513
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,285
Hey, we're up for a renewal.

514
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:08,665
are you going to renew with us?

515
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:09,865
We'd like to see you do that, da.

516
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:11,865
They're trying to upsell
you, all that stuff.

517
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:13,935
So you should know when
your renewal date is.

518
00:27:14,185 --> 00:27:18,245
Hopefully, you also know
when it's been paid, right?

519
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:21,505
that you're not calling them when
you haven't paid your bills, right?

520
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,995
Any other guides that they provide
you for specific reporting.

521
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:28,085
Someone, some of them will ask
you for specific error codes.

522
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:29,845
They might want stack traces.

523
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:32,905
back in the day they might
have had a TFTP site.

524
00:27:32,915 --> 00:27:36,085
I hope no one's still doing that, but
who knows, maybe out there they are.

525
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:40,995
or a place to like upload stuff in a
customer portal or things like that.

526
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:43,005
make sure you're documenting
that for folks as well.

527
00:27:43,225 --> 00:27:46,435
Because your on call person,
your responder might be the

528
00:27:46,435 --> 00:27:47,605
newest person on your team.

529
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,425
They don't know all the
ins and outs of this.

530
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:55,295
These are also good to have if you've
caused your own problem, right?

531
00:27:55,335 --> 00:27:58,525
Like we occasionally see, we've
got vendors where we've made too

532
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:01,685
many requests of the wrong type
and they lock us down, right?

533
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:02,425
That happens.

534
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:05,615
we've tested something out, it hasn't
worked, or it's like something changed

535
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:09,295
and we didn't catch it and, we were
making bad requests, they lock us out.

536
00:28:09,765 --> 00:28:12,835
We want to know, okay, here's the
vendor, here's the contact, how do we

537
00:28:12,835 --> 00:28:16,315
know, so that we can get that fixed,
so have this stuff anyway, like it's

538
00:28:16,315 --> 00:28:20,725
just important to know so that you're
not struggling to fix something, and

539
00:28:20,725 --> 00:28:22,525
not delaying your own response times.

540
00:28:24,965 --> 00:28:28,185
The biggest question you're going
to get then when you have a vendor

541
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:32,935
incident or vendor indicated incident
is do you contact them or do you wait?

542
00:28:35,245 --> 00:28:38,345
Contacting them if you're not sure
exactly that it is an incident

543
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:41,795
or they haven't verified it's an
incident on their status pages yet.

544
00:28:42,565 --> 00:28:44,995
definitely do that for
your main providers.

545
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:48,725
Large outages obviously are
going to make the news, right?

546
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:52,395
And they become a train
wreck that everyone watches.

547
00:28:52,735 --> 00:28:57,785
So for large incidents that way you'll
know that something is going on.

548
00:28:58,215 --> 00:29:03,825
small subsystems though, Generally don't
make the re the regular media news.

549
00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:08,005
They don't always even make the status
page depending on what's going on.

550
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:10,915
If it's something that doesn't
have a lot of users, some vendors

551
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,235
get very sloppy about that.

552
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:16,735
but making contact with your
account team, you should do that.

553
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:20,635
If you're not seeing any indicators from
the vendor that something is going on.

554
00:29:21,145 --> 00:29:24,865
You definitely do that too if you
want to be on the first notified list.

555
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:29,075
It's one of those things that you often
get with that premium support package is

556
00:29:29,195 --> 00:29:32,335
front row for remediation on incidents.

557
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:35,645
Especially if it's we're only seeing
this on a limited number of cases.

558
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:37,205
It's only in this database segment.

559
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:38,595
It's only in this geography.

560
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:41,625
It helps them, reaching out
to them helps them narrow down

561
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,015
the scope of their own issue.

562
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:47,165
It also gets you into that list
of folks who want to be notified.

563
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:53,245
If you decide to wait it out,
don't all hang out and wait, right?

564
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:55,765
And I've definitely seen this.

565
00:29:56,045 --> 00:30:00,595
Bridge calls, 80 people, 100 people
sitting around waiting for some

566
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:02,625
big vendor to fix an incident.

567
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:05,705
It's a huge waste of time, right?

568
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:08,555
You have other things you could be doing.

569
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:10,785
Let folks go.

570
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:15,265
Appoint a contact person who's going to
watch the updates and be the contact point

571
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:17,805
for, the responses back from the vendor.

572
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:21,840
Someone who can then keep
your stakeholders up to date.

573
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,450
Hopefully you have a
stakeholder communications plan.

574
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:28,670
That's a whole other talk, but
briefly, you should have some other

575
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,730
way that folks who aren't actively
responding to an incident can get

576
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:38,310
updates about that incident, whether
that is a special channel in your

577
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:43,270
team chat, or they can subscribe to
other updates and get text messages.

578
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,410
However, your methodology and
your tools work, you should have

579
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,570
that for the folks who are not
responding so that they know that.

580
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,360
Someone's still looking at this.

581
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,960
Top people are on it, right?

582
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,450
have that in place.

583
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,320
Hopefully that's already part
of your incident response, plan.

584
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,530
Make sure you're also
engaging your response team.

585
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,050
For your Tier 1 vendors,
obviously something is down.

586
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,610
It's going to impact how
your services perform.

587
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,200
So your support team needs
to know about that, right?

588
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,710
They're going to be on the receiving
end of all the sort of reports from

589
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,710
the customers, whether it's social
media or emails, or you've got a

590
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,580
phone number, or they reach out
to account teams, whatever it is.

591
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,100
They want to be able to collect all
that stuff up and make sure they

592
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,190
reach out, reach back out to all
those customers when things are fixed.

593
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,180
Update your status pages, keep your
customer message, messaging up to date.

594
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:38,305
If you've not worked in support, the
way a lot of those tools will work

595
00:31:38,335 --> 00:31:43,345
is that there'll be one big incident
ticket that has some boilerplate in it.

596
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:47,935
We know, here's what we're seeing, we
know it's an issue, we've contacted the

597
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:49,865
vendor, we're waiting for remediation.

598
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:53,435
Really straightforward, whatever,
and they can send that directly

599
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:57,225
back to those customers and they'll
add that customer to that ticket so

600
00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:59,235
they know this person reported in.

601
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:02,485
about this particular issue
that's ongoing, right?

602
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:03,635
So they can track all of that.

603
00:32:04,685 --> 00:32:07,555
Make sure that you are engaging
your support team so that

604
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:08,825
they can keep that up to date.

605
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:12,635
So the person who is watching for
updates from the vendor can also be

606
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:15,945
updating the support team to say this
is what they're telling us, they're

607
00:32:15,945 --> 00:32:17,575
anticipating another half an hour.

608
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:22,155
We don't want to prematurely say
that, but we can say that, yeah,

609
00:32:22,305 --> 00:32:23,335
the vendor is looking at it.

610
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:29,695
For things like status pages and
external status updates, beware

611
00:32:29,695 --> 00:32:31,645
of disparaging comments, right?

612
00:32:32,505 --> 00:32:33,595
Be nice to your vendors.

613
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:35,985
You don't want them to, kick
you off their platform because

614
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:37,125
they don't like you, right?

615
00:32:37,585 --> 00:32:42,105
it also sucks for your customers
to say, Oh, yeah, we were out

616
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:44,355
because vendor X is crap, right?

617
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:46,375
you decided to use them, right?

618
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:48,220
So it's still your problem.

619
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,490
making sure that you're
using, nice language.

620
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,730
There, you've built this relationship
hopefully with some of these providers.

621
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,950
You're able to say, recognize that our
customers experience blah, blah, blah.

622
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,340
Our vendor remediated
it, blah, blah, blah.

623
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,600
and go from there.

624
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,410
But, beware, shit talking
anybody on the internet that way.

625
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,140
Finally.

626
00:33:12,135 --> 00:33:13,565
Run a post incident review.

627
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:18,135
A lot of folks are hesitant to
do this about vendor incidents,

628
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:20,135
but you absolutely want to.

629
00:33:20,985 --> 00:33:23,145
You do really and truly want to do this.

630
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:27,465
I know it's a lot of work to run another
incident review for things that are like

631
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:30,205
our fault, but you want to do it, right?

632
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:35,815
Just like you do for your own incidents,
because there's learnings to be had

633
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:38,725
here for your organization as well.

634
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,800
Create your timelines, put
all that stuff together.

635
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,680
As you collect these up over time, you're
replacing your vibes and your feelings

636
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,830
about this vendor with actual data.

637
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:54,715
it feels like this vendor is down all
the time, but then you go back through

638
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:59,105
your history, you can say, Oh, it was
five minutes in December and then three

639
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:03,335
minutes in March, but then they did
have that great big long thing, like 15

640
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,425
minutes, half an hour in June, right?

641
00:34:05,435 --> 00:34:07,035
You have that data, right?

642
00:34:07,635 --> 00:34:12,485
It also gives you some leverage when
you go to renewal that contract, right?

643
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:16,945
You can say, we're not really seeing
the reliability we need from you guys.

644
00:34:17,175 --> 00:34:18,275
What can you do for us?

645
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,580
And you have the data.

646
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,830
Because they're not going to come
forward with their reliability data.

647
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,830
Especially if it's still
within their contractual SLAs.

648
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,020
But you have it.

649
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,140
Because you recorded it in
your post incident reviews.

650
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,360
So you have it for yourself.

651
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,570
Creates all that stuff.

652
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,410
Discuss any missing information.

653
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,520
Anything that's new.

654
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,660
Anything that's changed.

655
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,820
this time they ask us for logs in
this particular part of the portal.

656
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,930
It was different from the last time.

657
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,320
Update the runbooks.

658
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,320
Any new learnings about the vendor.

659
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,365
Right here.

660
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:49,095
You can also invite the
vendor to these, right?

661
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:50,305
Think about that.

662
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:54,365
You've spent all this time during the
duration of your contract building up

663
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:59,295
this great relationship, and you meet
with them every month, and they tell

664
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:03,275
you all about the new stuff, and you
talk about whatever sport ball you

665
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:05,515
like or whatever on these great calls.

666
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:08,835
You're going to have a post incident
review about their incident,

667
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:10,355
how it impacted your customers.

668
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:11,795
Invite them along.

669
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:12,915
They might send.

670
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:15,335
A bigwig, right?

671
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,145
They might send a C level
executive to your incident review.

672
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,355
That expands your
relationship with them, right?

673
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:24,995
It helps them also get better
at mitigating those incidents.

674
00:35:25,005 --> 00:35:27,135
It's a reciprocal relationship there.

675
00:35:28,665 --> 00:35:32,265
And then after everything has quiesced
and everyone has calmed down and

676
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:34,375
you've left the vibes behind, right?

677
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:40,345
Then it's time to discuss if this has
been enough impact to find a new vendor.

678
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:44,835
It's not a decision you're going to
make in the moment when they're down.

679
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:47,265
Because you're probably not
going to be able to get your

680
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:48,485
stuff out of there anyhow, right?

681
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,535
When everything is quiet,

682
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:55,595
then you can discuss finding a new vendor.

683
00:35:55,915 --> 00:35:57,625
Because there's a lot of
things to balance out.

684
00:35:57,825 --> 00:36:01,905
If you have that history and you're able
to say, this year, since our contract

685
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:06,655
started, they've only reached 95 percent
reliability, that's not good enough

686
00:36:06,655 --> 00:36:11,305
for us, we want to start looking for
someone else, that's Then you can discuss

687
00:36:11,315 --> 00:36:14,575
things like your switching costs and
the contract duration, if you need to

688
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:18,795
buy out the contract, how long it would
take you to implement on a new vendor,

689
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:22,705
what are the potential other vendors
that meet your needs, will you need to

690
00:36:22,705 --> 00:36:26,975
re architect anything to use a different
vendor, and have another discussion there.

691
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:29,565
Because that's going to be in depth,
it's not going to be something that

692
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:31,525
you can solve in an hour meeting.

693
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:34,265
It's going to be something that
takes several weeks to do all the

694
00:36:34,265 --> 00:36:36,405
discovery and figure everything out.

695
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:38,575
So it's not something that
you want to jump into.

696
00:36:38,855 --> 00:36:40,235
While they're having an outage.

697
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:43,915
If the data center is burned
down, that's a different story.

698
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:46,345
And you need to, you don't
have anywhere else to go.

699
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:50,105
That, that might be a
mitigating factor there.

700
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:54,935
But for a lot of the incidents that we do
see across SAS providers and those kinds

701
00:36:54,935 --> 00:36:58,965
of things, like there's, and rushing is
not going to help you in that respect.

702
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:02,675
You want to be in a place where
you can make a rational decision

703
00:37:02,945 --> 00:37:05,945
outside of the scope of the
incident to figure things out.

704
00:37:07,095 --> 00:37:09,065
So there's a lot of things here.

705
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:12,015
a lot of things that we don't
necessarily think about all the

706
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:15,155
time because we figure, Oh, it's
their problem, they'll fix it.

707
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:18,095
But taking ownership of your
customer experience for your

708
00:37:18,095 --> 00:37:20,125
customers is super important.

709
00:37:20,145 --> 00:37:24,485
And it does encompass how you have
relationships with your vendors.

710
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:28,745
So in summary, organize your vendors,
figure out who's most important to

711
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:33,705
you, and who maybe you should spend a
little bit more time and resources with.

712
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,970
Document your relationship owners.

713
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,000
Who knows that vendor the best?

714
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,220
Who is out there in our team who
knows how to use that thing the best?

715
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,150
Create your vendor runbooks.

716
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,240
Know exactly who you are to the
vendor, how your relationships

717
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,720
go, how to contact support.

718
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,240
Keep in touch with the important vendors.

719
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:58,500
I know sometimes it feels boring to have
those regular calls, but do it, right?

720
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,580
Do it for yourself.

721
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,840
Keep your customers
informed in a positive way.

722
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:07,368
We're working with the vendor,
we're expecting remediation, da.

723
00:38:07,848 --> 00:38:13,148
Run your post incident reviews, capture
that data, capture those timelines,

724
00:38:13,588 --> 00:38:16,678
know how things went, work with them.

725
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:20,758
Hey, we would really appreciate it if
you could update your status earlier.

726
00:38:22,028 --> 00:38:24,608
Let us know things earlier,
those kinds of things.

727
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:27,568
You're building those relationships,
and they can take that feedback.

728
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:29,428
They may not change, but
they can take their feedback.

729
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:32,738
So there's a lot of things here that you
can be doing in a more proactive way,

730
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:37,488
even though what's going on is outside
the scope of something you can fix.

731
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:40,538
hopefully that's helpful, it gives
you something to chew on, and think

732
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:45,853
about, because obviously as we move
more and more into what's SAS based

733
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:49,113
products, they're going to happen, right?

734
00:38:49,343 --> 00:38:53,393
Even if you bring everything internally,
you probably have someone else that

735
00:38:53,393 --> 00:38:57,503
you've outsourced a lot of things to
somewhere else in your, in your workflows.

736
00:38:57,503 --> 00:39:00,383
A lot of things that hopefully
you haven't built yourself, right?

737
00:39:00,393 --> 00:39:02,123
Because, That's a lot of
work for some of that stuff.

738
00:39:02,763 --> 00:39:04,313
Alright, so you can learn more.

739

746

We also have a podcast episode
about this, with Jeff Martens.

747
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,918
And, it was great.

748
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:25,888
I'd love for everyone to listen to that.

749
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:27,318
