1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,300
Today, I'm going to discuss about
the future of utility management

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,780
system leveraging the advanced
customer information systems.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,200
Basically, we are trying to transform the
utility industry using the latest and the

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,399
greatest technology that we recently had
AI to efficiently manage the operations

5
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,119
and increase the customer satisfaction.

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,330
So here, it's mostly related to the
utilities industry, but we're trying

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,570
to discuss more about the technologies
that we used for this conference.

8
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:35,075
So here is the content, table of
contents that we are going to discuss.

9
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:39,095
this is all about introduction to
CIS, challenges with the legacy CIS

10
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:44,865
system, and the benefits of upgrading
the CIS system, and the key components

11
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:48,675
of a CIS upgrade, the whole CIS
upgrade process, how it can be done.

12
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:52,525
we'll take an example of Catapult project
that we recently implemented here in

13
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:55,185
Kansas Board of Utilities, Kansas City.

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,650
board of public utilities.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,700
And, the, what are the, all the
tangible outcomes for, the CI

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,660
subgrid that we did, the future
proofing of these utility operations.

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,300
And then we'll have a small
conclusion for question and answers.

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:15,430
let's talk first about the introduction to
CI system, what CI system, would encompass

19
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:22,635
and what all the systems that it includes,
to help the We are to help the utility

20
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:25,395
system utilities to manage the customers.

21
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:28,365
So this is a critical part of the.

22
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,820
managing, customer interactions
like billing and services, drives

23
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,350
efficiency in utility operations
by centralized, customer data.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,450
And it also enables adaptation to future
technologies like smart grids and IoT.

25
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:48,350
So whenever the, so for example, you have
a lot of meters connected all together.

26
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,260
To the system and whenever the billing
happens, there is nothing manual here.

27
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,260
So everything is automated from the
grid to the billing system, and how

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,970
this automation is done and how this,
customer information system leverages

29
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,965
the whole, collection of data to enhance
the customer, customer satisfaction

30
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,655
is what it is all about in the CIS.

31
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:16,095
So the modern energy sector demands
responsive and data driven systems.

32
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:21,015
the modern system where the customers
are using a lot of mobile phones and

33
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:25,955
they want to get an idea about how much
energy is being used and, how far the

34
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:30,180
bill is and when did they pay and they
wanted to pay online using the mobiles

35
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,840
and all these, operations which the
customers want to do can be done using

36
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,580
upgrading the customer information system.

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,220
So the legacy systems lack
the flexibility and power to

38
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,550
meet growing industry demands.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,620
That's obvious.

40
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,350
and, thus, CIS modernization
enhances the ability to meet

41
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,890
regulatory and compliance standards.

42
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,960
So the most of the public utilities,
they have these regulatory and compliance

43
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,590
standards, which they got to meet
with the, the state's public utility

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,340
commission, where they Fix the rates,
even if they want to increase any of

45
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,290
the burden on the financial burden
on the customers, they, these state

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,530
organizations, they make sure the
customers are satisfied and there is, they

47
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,510
follow some rules to, in case of they want
to increase the cost for these utilities.

48
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,570
And, what are all the challenges
with the legacy systems?

49
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,860
the scalability issues, and integration
difficulties, poor user experience

50
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,640
inefficient workflows due to outdated
design, maintenance challenges like the

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,080
higher cost if you want to go to upgrade
it can't be pushed to cloud and this

52
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,645
the existing legacy systems is all about
in the They're all in the cloud, right?

53
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:46,455
the latest and greatest technologies
are all in the cloud and, the computing

54
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:48,125
is all performed in the cloud.

55
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:53,975
But when you come to the old legacy
systems, the systems are all installed

56
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:58,475
in the on prem like Linux and other
late, Technologies which sit on the

57
00:03:59,385 --> 00:04:05,445
on premise server room where we have a
server team and a lot of administrators

58
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:11,455
and DevOps personnel working on
automating all these operations on the

59
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:16,225
on premise, coming from installation,
upgrades and all the stuff, right?

60
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:19,575
so we don't want to go with the
legacy system where all these

61
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:23,845
operations are taken care on site
by the, within the, people, IT

62
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:26,155
personal staff of the utilities.

63
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:31,665
So when we go to the new system, all these
are taken care of in the cloud, right?

64
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:35,635
So that's obvious with the latest
technologies that are going on.

65
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:39,915
And there are also a lot of security
vulnerabilities with the legacy systems

66
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:46,340
and Cyber security threats, legacy systems
leads to bottlenecks in operations,

67
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,060
impacting customer satisfaction and
long response times during high demand

68
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,060
periods due to outdated infrastructure.

69
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:56,715
so what are all the benefits
of, upgrading the CI system?

70
00:04:56,765 --> 00:05:00,375
the enhanced user interface, the
customizable dashboards, improved

71
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:04,375
navigation for quicker access to data,
improved, data handling, supports

72
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:09,780
large scale data, processing with
real time insights and superior

73
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,090
customer service where interactive
self service portals and instant

74
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,840
communication via multiple channels.

75
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,020
So it easily integrates with
emerging technologies like

76
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,580
renewable energy and management.

77
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,365
So some, for example, you want to
have a solar farm where customers

78
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:32,135
wanted renewable energy from the
solar farm, or they want to install

79
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:35,195
a renewable energy source on their
own, sy on their own premise.

80
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:40,265
and, the grid can accept, absorb
some of the energy from their

81
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,275
system when they have access.

82
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:42,995
And, and.

83
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:47,925
When they want more energy, which they
can't produce, the grid can supply.

84
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:51,745
So all this is called net metering
system in, the modern system where,

85
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:55,995
using the latest and greatest
technologies can be configured, right?

86
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,560
and scalability and future proofing.

87
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,790
easily integrating with, integrates with
the emerging technologies like Yeah.

88
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,470
That we discussed, we just discussed.

89
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,370
So data driven insights enables
advanced analytics for productive

90
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,050
maintenance and demand forecasting.

91
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,410
Yeah.

92
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,300
there, there is a system by
name called Maxima within the

93
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,020
CIS utility system where, uh.

94
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,020
where all the meters, all the inventory
and all the personnel that you see during

95
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,580
the outages, the outages, this can be
automated using the preventive maintenance

96
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,480
that we are using the latest technologies.

97
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,940
the cost efficiency obviously reduces
operational costs by automating tasks

98
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,650
and workflows, which the billing
and other teams, most of their

99
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,560
administrative tasks can be, automated.

100
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,560
So regulatory compliance, streamlines,
adherence to the evolving,

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,830
evolving, industry regulations.

102
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,660
So the utility system is a wide, more
than, 50 utility systems within the

103
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,790
states and in some states have, so
everything, every utility system has to

104
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,700
follow some rate structure approved by
the, commissioner or something through

105
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,510
Zoom calls to the customers where they
have to, agree with the rate structure

106
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,670
that is prescribed by the utilities, put
forward by the utilities for the future.

107
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,490
all these.

108
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:15,655
Standards are taken care of by using
the latest and latest CIS upgrades.

109
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,165
So the what about the key components?

110
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:21,720
So what does these key
components of CS upgrade include?

111
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:29,240
So the enhanced user interfaces because
of the latest, user interactions, with

112
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,670
the new software takes very less time.

113
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,760
It improves the productivity, making
the system user friendly, right?

114
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,740
Oh, the older system, there are, let's say
if they want to go to a workflow, if they

115
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,130
have 10 clicks to reach the end, to get
to information to respond to a customer.

116
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,700
So with the enhanced user interface, the
time to reach, to get the information

117
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,820
and respond to a customer is very less.

118
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,580
So advanced data handling capabilities
and capable of processing data from

119
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,840
various sources such as smart meters
and IOT devices So all these IOT

120
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,170
devices and this and smart meters, they
produce lots and lots of data whether

121
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:14,810
it could be testing those meters whether
the voltage is testing is performed

122
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:20,795
with the without going through the We
thought, sending the personal from the

123
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:23,495
inventory station to the, location.

124
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:28,515
So all these, data that we are getting
from, The meters and IOT devices

125
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:32,655
which are managed by the utility,
can be analyzed within the CI system.

126
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:35,505
So that's, one of the
major advantage, of this.

127
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,605
So robust integration capabilities,
the CI system can be integrated with

128
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:43,135
all the GIS information system and
customer relationship management

129
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:45,225
and, and metadata management.

130
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,045
So metadata management is
some, something like a sucker,

131
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:50,215
which gets all the information.

132
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:51,495
And there are some.

133
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,640
capabilities within the MDM system,
which processes before it spits out that

134
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,700
information to the CI system, right?

135
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:03,570
the, all the integration is between all
these systems and the CI sits like a

136
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,620
heart within, between all these systems.

137
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:13,003
So when you get real time analytics,
the, it provides operational insights,

138
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:17,573
helping utilities and manage peak
demand periods, obviously when all the

139
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:22,913
customers, when there is a game like
an NFL, when all of them want to sit

140
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:28,423
and watch, and, during such peak demand
periods can be addressed easily with the,

141
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:32,753
By forecasting the energy demand usage
with this latest information that we are

142
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:38,623
using, that we are getting from these
smart devices and, and when you have all

143
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:45,323
this information, so you can predict the
future of the, energy usage and, have,

144
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:48,503
a lot of initiatives where, with the.

145
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:54,328
you can propose a time when if a
customer wants to use less energy

146
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:57,318
during those peak times, you can
reward the customer for that time.

147
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:03,238
And all these, new features can
be enhanced using the CIS system.

148
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:07,938
obviously the security and compliance
sits at the forefront of, The CS system

149
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:11,298
or whichever system we are having now
in the IT world because of the cyber

150
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:16,208
security threats that we are getting where
all we need to make sure the customer's

151
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:25,688
data is secured and it's stored in a
reliable place like a dedicated cloud

152
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:33,285
location like, for a lot of these,
latest, like AWS, Azure, and other.

153
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:39,685
vendors like Oracle, they build a
separate, data centers for government

154
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:44,025
organizations so that they don't
have to, worry about the compliance

155
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:48,200
and, regulatory issues, which comes
with this, data accessibility things.

156
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,570
So what is the whole process
of CIS upgrade process, right?

157
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,850
The comprehensive evolution of current
systems weakness and bottlenecks,

158
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,120
identify pain points through feedback
from end users, understand regulatory and

159
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,370
compliance gaps, planning, obviously the
developer roadmap for technology section,

160
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,940
selection and resource allocation.

161
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,630
All, some of these things are project
management, tasks, where, the technology

162
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,450
roadmap and, resource allocation,
comes under that, align upgrade.

163
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,760
So the strategic initiatives from the
CIO or the, the organization from the

164
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,790
board, needs the IT needs to map and
align our initial, tasks according

165
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,521
to the plan, proposed by their board.

166
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,881
so how the implementation, obviously
it has to be a phased manner.

167
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,581
You can't just, take down the
legacy system and then have

168
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:36,851
the new system available.

169
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:37,771
that's how it is, right?

170
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:42,051
So it has to be a phased manner where
each functionality is moved out and

171
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:44,541
then eventually a cut, a cutout is done.

172
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:48,471
so let's say, and we're talking
here about training and support.

173
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:52,051
it's obvious that, all the new system.

174
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:59,451
It shouldn't be more easy for the
existing billing clerks and MDM analysts

175
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:04,501
or the business users to get on as
soon as they were given the new system.

176
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:08,371
So obviously there is a lot
of training and regression

177
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:11,176
test cases that they executed.

178
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:13,236
execute before the system goes live.

179
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:18,271
That makes them more comfortable in using
this and, and also the risk mitigation

180
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:22,391
is separate, separate team where they're
identifying the potential risk and impact

181
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:24,181
upon operations during this transition.

182
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:29,351
So that this is all about the whole
upgrade process, what all different steps

183
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,101
that we include and different measures
that we take for the smooth transition.

184
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:37,991
for example, we implemented a
project by name Catapult, which we

185
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:43,161
call it as because, we are moving
from, existing legacy system for all

186
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:47,291
these head end MDM, CIS, and Maxmo.

187
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:51,141
All these systems could be upgraded
at a single shot and Make the,

188
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:55,461
utility system in the, latest and
greatest technology use usable, right?

189
00:12:55,721 --> 00:13:00,331
so the legacy system, the obviously slow
processing and high operational costs.

190
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:04,141
the, with an upgraded system, we have
modular design, faster data processing

191
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:05,581
and improved customer interaction.

192
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,841
What are all the tangible outcomes?

193
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:12,436
So impact of CIS upgrade, the key outcomes
are Operational efficiency, reduced

194
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:15,836
processing times, automation, and manual
workflows like we discussed earlier.

195
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:23,136
The business users can easily automate and
process time and the processing time is

196
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,696
reduced and manual workflows are reduced.

197
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:31,726
So obviously operational efficiency
is achieved by saving a lot of time.

198
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:35,516
Faster query selection with comprehensive
customer data at fingertips.

199
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:38,176
the more easier, the more flexible.

200
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:41,501
For a business user to get
information, the better he

201
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,571
can serve the customer, right?

202
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:47,581
The billing accuracy, the more the
number of issues that you get with the

203
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:53,611
billing system with the cycles that you
run every day are reduced by more than

204
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:58,146
50 to 60 percent with the new billing
system, obviously, because of the

205
00:13:58,236 --> 00:14:02,256
availability of data and the accuracy and
the dashboards that we discussed before.

206
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:07,906
The data driven decisions, the use of real
time analytics for data forecasting and

207
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:14,146
energy management, that's coming from the
smart grid and analyzed at the, Dashboards

208
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,176
that are provided with the new CS upgrade.

209
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:19,836
There are a lot of cost savings through
automation and modern infrastructure,

210
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:23,546
improved collaboration, seamless
data sharing across departments,

211
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:27,246
improves overall energy, operational
synergy, employee productivity,

212
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:31,291
improved system usability, results in
faster onboarding and fewer errors.

213
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:35,201
how do we use this as a future proofing
utility operation system, right?

214
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:41,911
financial services API security access,
success, scalability, designed to grow

215
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:46,641
with increased customer base, data volume,
In integration with smart technology,

216
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:51,981
seamless adaptation to smart meters,
electrics, charging stations and renewable

217
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:57,611
energy sources, regulatory adaptability
and customer engagement enhances customer

218
00:14:57,611 --> 00:15:02,411
facing features such as mobility app,
mobile apps and self service portals and

219
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:06,540
system architecture allows for incremental
upgrades ensuring long term cost control.

220
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:12,211
Finally, the modernization of CIS
system is just not a technical upgrade.

221
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:17,801
It is a strategic improvement for,
utility companies, looking to thrive.

222
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:19,401
Sorry.

223
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:24,101
Thriving in the modern energy
landscape, upgrading to a modern CIS

224
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,931
offers immense benefits including
enhanced operational efficiency,

225
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:31,971
improved customer satisfaction, and a
scalable foundation for future growth.

226
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,501
By addressing the limitations of
legacy systems, utilities can unlock

227
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:39,051
the potential of real time data
analytics, advanced customer service

228
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:42,851
features, and seamless integration
with new technologies such as smart

229
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:44,111
meters and renewable energy sources.

230
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:48,766
As the energy sector continues to
evolve, staying competitive requires

231
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:54,666
adaptable, adapting, fixable, future
proof, systems that can grow the needs

232
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,236
of both company and its customers.

233
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:59,766
Investing in sales modernization
today ensures that utilities are well

234
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:04,106
positioned to meet rising customer
expectations, comply with emerging

235
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:07,896
regulatory requirements, and optimize
their operations for long term success.

236
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,230
That's all.

237
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,511
Thank you so much.

238
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:15,341
And if you have any questions,
you can post me online or you can

239
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:18,781
post to the virtual conference
question and answer section.

240
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:21,511
So I'd be happy to answer
all those questions.

241
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:21,971
Thank you.
