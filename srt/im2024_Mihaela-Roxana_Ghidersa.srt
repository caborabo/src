1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:01,150
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,950
My name is Mihaela Guitersa.

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,020
Happy to be with you here today.

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,590
Thank you to the organizers for giving
me the opportunity to share what I love

5
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:14,510
and what I've learned into my experiences
and challenges that I had along the way.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,439
At my core, I'm an engineer and I also
like, even though it sounds being an

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,827
engineer and someone that does some
public speaking, it's not really coming

8
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:29,353
together, but I really like to do this
and Besides my interest in software and

9
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:34,393
technology, I like to research and prepare
content that I gather from my experiences

10
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:38,453
or from things that I would have liked
to know at some point, and I didn't.

11
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:40,333
I didn't have anyone to tell me.

12
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:45,063
And I wrap this in my presentation
and, open the conversation in

13
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:46,123
events like this one today.

14
00:00:46,123 --> 00:00:50,293
So thank you to the organizers
for having me again, and.

15
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:55,733
I hope that we have a beautiful
conversation or that I at least

16
00:00:55,743 --> 00:01:01,683
challenge you a bit to go outside of
your, your area of looking at things.

17
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:06,483
Why I'm saying this because
today's conversation, it's

18
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:14,368
going into the area of not so much
technicalities, but the way we are looking

19
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:18,688
at the problems and challenges that we
encounter every day, the way that we

20
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:24,888
organize our work, the way we think about
ourselves as developers, I'm trying to

21
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:30,278
open the conversation about how we are,
interacting with, with our work and with

22
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,748
our challenges on, on a daily basis.

23
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:38,258
I want to open the conversation
with a little exercise, an

24
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:39,708
imagination exercise, basically.

25
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:44,468
Think that you're standing at the
base of a towering skyscraper and you

26
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:46,408
marvel at its intricate design, right?

27
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:50,778
Every element in the structure,
it was meticulously planned.

28
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:53,998
Each element is serving a
purpose in the overall structure.

29
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:58,878
Now let's think about the architect
who designed that, how they had to

30
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:00,958
envision all those interactions.

31
00:02:01,418 --> 00:02:06,958
How their building is going to
stand, withstand the test of time

32
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:13,418
and face storms and all sorts of
challenges, serve its occupants.

33
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:19,178
How everything was so purposeful
thought of in order to have the best,

34
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:21,488
yeah, the best structure in the end.

35
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:22,958
So starting with this mindset,

36
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:27,228
we can transform the way
we are building software.

37
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:33,698
Taking this kind of concepts from another
field encourages us to think beyond the

38
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:37,668
immediate, to consider the long term
impact of our decisions, and to create

39
00:02:37,668 --> 00:02:43,028
systems that are not just functional,
but resilient and scalable and enduring.

40
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:47,148
I want us to stay with
this analogy in our mind.

41
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:52,163
We are not just coding, we are building
something of a digital skyscraper.

42
00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:55,483
Let's explore how we can build
them with the same level of

43
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,573
care, creativity, and foresight.

44
00:02:57,753 --> 00:03:02,783
Because as programmers, we often
find it challenging to step back

45
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,783
and see our products like we are
looking at a building, right?

46
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:09,683
Most of the time we are deeply
engrossed in our tasks and unlike

47
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:15,038
physical construction, we don't have
the same boundaries, very strict,

48
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:16,498
very exact boundaries, right?

49
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:19,468
Software development does not
have the same limitations.

50
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:23,828
We have freedom and we have flexibility to
push these boundaries, actually push the

51
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,858
boundaries of what's possible in the end.

52
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:32,078
despite this freedom, when we discuss
perspective and way of thinking, we tend

53
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,158
to stick to familiar patterns, rules.

54
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:41,053
And we rarely venture outside the box and
even when we do, we may not really embrace

55
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:45,533
new ways of thinking, we feel comfortable
to stick to our existing beliefs, but by

56
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,473
breaking the cycle through reflection.

57
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:50,888
We can adopt the growth mindset
that leads to better decisions and

58
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:52,408
a more fulfilling work experience.

59
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:57,768
And mindset in this case refers to
attitudes and beliefs that shape the

60
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:01,758
way we approach work, the way we solve
problems, the way we tackle challenges.

61
00:04:02,338 --> 00:04:06,658
It's the lens through which we view
our abilities, tasks, and potential

62
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:12,328
for work, and the way we actually
face challenges and brace for impact

63
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:15,028
when difficult situations appear.

64
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:19,558
And when we're discussing
mindset, We cannot stop,

65
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:28,908
we cannot avoid stopping actually
and looking at ourselves and if

66
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:32,858
you've ever thought Okay, I'm
just not good at algorithms.

67
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:36,348
I'll never understand this framework
instead of I don't understand

68
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:38,328
this yet But I can figure it out.

69
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:43,638
You are topping into fixed mindset
because this perspective limits

70
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:47,538
your growth It creates a mental
barrier to learning and adaptation.

71
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:51,568
Developers with a fixed mindset shy
away from challenges, fearing that

72
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:53,668
failure will expose their limitations.

73
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:57,058
In contrast, a growth mindset
is the belief that abilities and

74
00:04:57,058 --> 00:05:00,908
intelligence can be developed through
dedication, learning, hard work.

75
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:04,208
People with a growth mindset
embrace challenges and view

76
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:06,118
failures as opportunities to learn.

77
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:10,698
So we need to be very honest with
ourselves and see exactly where we are.

78
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:15,833
And I'm not asking you right now to
tell me, okay, what, where are you?

79
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:17,293
Where do you find yourself more?

80
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:21,793
But more I want you to be honest
with yourself, because in the end,

81
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:25,423
the scope of this discussion is to
set a starting point for growth.

82
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:28,803
And since we're discussing about
starting point, I think it's a

83
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:35,313
good thing to bring to discussion
a story that I heard a while ago.

84
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:39,783
I think I was I don't know, doing some
volunteering and someone told me I

85
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:43,843
don't know who is the author, whoever
is, copyrights to you, credits to you.

86
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:47,193
But the story goes like this.

87
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:51,173
There were some people on a
hill that were breaking stones.

88
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:55,663
And then there is this man that
was going towards the hill and he

89
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:58,903
got curious and asked one of the
people, okay, what are you doing?

90
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,413
And that person was very
focused on your work.

91
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:05,153
And they were bothered by the question.

92
00:06:05,763 --> 00:06:07,823
No, they didn't like to be
disturbed from their work

93
00:06:07,823 --> 00:06:08,973
because they were very dedicated.

94
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:11,603
In the end, he answered and
said, I am breaking stones.

95
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:16,043
The man got very curious and he went
to another and to another until at

96
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:20,603
some point he got a different response
because this last person that he asked

97
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:22,743
told him, I am building a castle.

98
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,513
As developers, we grow and
we go to phases, right?

99
00:06:26,513 --> 00:06:31,803
Sometimes we simply complete
tasks and we are just so focused

100
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,223
in that area that we complete.

101
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,158
The entire context.

102
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:36,208
So we are breaking stones.

103
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:41,568
On other times, we are interested in
understanding the system and going

104
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,868
beyond the task and trying to understand
the business, maybe very dedicated,

105
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:49,208
trying to improve and so on, which
is like building castles, right?

106
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:52,818
There are many reasons
this imbalance happens is.

107
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:55,813
Sometimes it's the organizations
where we are working.

108
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:58,933
Sometimes it's the limitation to
information, to the right information.

109
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:03,623
Lack of options, fear, burnout,
not caring about a project.

110
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,723
this is a reality that we
have to be honest about.

111
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:09,123
Or maybe we're just the right,
the wrong person for the job.

112
00:07:09,273 --> 00:07:09,923
this happens.

113
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:17,233
But I feel that we are so
impacted by outside factors and

114
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,598
we are so overwhelmed with it.

115
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:23,968
Checking some sort of what is the image
of the great developer at some point,

116
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:26,928
like we have that thing with the effective
developer or efficient developer.

117
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,388
Should I be an effective developer,
one that takes time to ensure code

118
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:33,218
is clean and scalable and documented,
or should I be an efficient

119
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,868
developer that I implement, I log
box, I deploy, I, this approach

120
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,928
allows me a faster time to market.

121
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:45,718
And, I'll just focus on speed,
skip this part with extended

122
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:47,878
documentation and meetings and so on.

123
00:07:49,398 --> 00:07:52,118
We are trying to comply with some
patterns, but sometimes we have to look

124
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:56,348
at ourselves as professional despite, the
context in which we are at some point.

125
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:57,708
add our skills.

126
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:05,403
And again, I dare you to be honest
and use the circle of competence to

127
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,493
understand what are your strengths,
your limits, and expertise.

128
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:15,313
Using this mental model in the end, it's
about focusing on what you know well and

129
00:08:15,313 --> 00:08:17,173
recognizing where your knowledge gaps are.

130
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:20,743
And in this way, you can work
effectively with your expertise

131
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:21,863
while expanding it over time.

132
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:24,523
So we can start from the
inside circle, right?

133
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:29,423
Identifying that, seeing what are
your strengths, what technologies,

134
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:31,963
languages, patterns, you truly
understand at a deep level.

135
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:34,378
Be honest about your limits.

136
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,628
Stay focused on your areas of expertise
while delivering a current project

137
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:42,478
because this allows you to build
confidently and produce high quality work.

138
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,898
When presented with tasks outside
your circle, collaborate with others,

139
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:48,538
whose strengths complement yours.

140
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:50,768
People that inspire
and you can learn from.

141
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:55,528
While you're going, outside
in the circle, right?

142
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:57,398
Outside of your, the stuff you know.

143
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:01,478
Identify knowledge gaps or areas of
interest that you want to grow into.

144
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:03,438
Set clear goals.

145
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:04,728
practice.

146
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:08,488
Take on projects that stretch
just outside your circle but

147
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:09,578
are manageable with effort.

148
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:13,738
Of course, we're going into
this process, we're having this

149
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:15,598
process, taken into consideration.

150
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:22,088
Helps you avoid a situation of
overextending your, and having

151
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:27,698
overconfidence, because you must be
cautious about assuming you're skilled

152
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:32,168
in areas just because you've been working
at some point with something similar.

153
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:38,448
And there is this, cognitive bias,
the Dunning Kruger effect, where it

154
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:42,978
is demonstrated by this psychologist,
through a series of experiments that

155
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:47,443
People with low ability or knowledge in a
specific area tend to overestimate their

156
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:52,643
skills, while others with higher ability
often underestimate their skills, right?

157
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:57,853
So this keeps a balance for
you to know exactly where

158
00:09:57,853 --> 00:09:59,593
you are and don't overextend.

159
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:03,363
I'm sure that each of you had a
situation at some point where you had

160
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:09,193
to deal with someone that was having
this bias and you were just so you

161
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,493
know, maybe pissed about the fact that
they are being so confident when you

162
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:13,673
know exactly how things should be.

163
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,793
So don't be that person.

164
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:23,153
On another part, there is this mental
barrier that we need to be careful about.

165
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:31,253
Because even if we don't realize, this
is something that is very powerful

166
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:32,893
and limiting at the same time.

167
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:39,123
Because, let's say, if you identify
as a NET developer, you are a

168
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:40,073
NET developer, you are stuck.

169
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:40,748
Right?

170
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,048
in your mind, you are a
NET or Java or whatever.

171
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:44,568
It doesn't matter.

172
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:46,728
You are an X developer.

173
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:53,388
But if you are identifying as a
developer who is using X, which can

174
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:59,143
be NET, Java, whatever, you suddenly
can be a programmer that knows and can

175
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:01,713
learn and can try other things too.

176
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:06,763
Just think of situations where you, maybe
someone in your company and said, okay,

177
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:10,573
we don't have a project right now that
it's using the skills that you have.

178
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:14,743
But look, there is this opening
in here, something that we think

179
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:16,063
that might be interesting to you.

180
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:18,563
technologies are going to evolve.

181
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:20,763
So try to not identify with them.

182
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:24,873
Try to keep your mindset fluid
in this area and don't block

183
00:11:24,873 --> 00:11:26,613
yourself into a, a bubble.

184
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:30,188
The circle of competence isn't
just about recognizing your skill.

185
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:31,628
It's a tool for growth in the end.

186
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,488
When you understand where you excel
and where you need to improve,

187
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,548
you can make better decisions.

188
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:44,208
You can work on yourself constantly and
become not efficient or effective or, all

189
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:51,108
sorts of labels, but be a developer that
is bringing some impact in your work.

190
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:56,328
We've been discussing about the inner
circle and we've been discussing about

191
00:11:56,348 --> 00:12:01,488
that circle where we know what we don't
know and we want to grow, but we also

192
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:04,888
touched the areas where we think we know
something, but we actually don't know.

193
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:06,598
But how about that outside circle?

194
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:08,388
The thing that we don't
know that we don't know.

195
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,938
How do we tap into that area?

196
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:15,153
that area that I think that is the
area of blind spots, It's difficult to

197
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:18,483
understand the system we're a part of
precisely because there are blind spots.

198
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,703
We can't see what we are looking for.

199
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,953
We only see them at some point where
we have, we have somebody porting from

200
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:25,273
production or something like this.

201
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:30,633
And a way to do this, I found, of course,
a lot of the conversation that we are

202
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:36,953
having today has a lot of points from the
book, that can be found also in the book.

203
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:44,938
This precisely got my attention because
these are three things that if we work

204
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:52,298
with, are going to help us see the
blind spots that we have to reveal those

205
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:57,318
blind spots and, at least minimize that
area, if not completely, reveal it.

206
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,828
So first would be that.

207
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:05,948
Of course, we are discussing, I was
mentioning the book, which is The

208
00:13:05,948 --> 00:13:07,928
Great Mental Models by Shane Pursh.

209
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,438
And in the book, we have these three

210
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:11,078
factors.

211
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:14,208
Perspective, ego induced denial,
and distance from the consequences.

212
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:19,193
We need to approach problems with
different perspectives, even if it goes

213
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:21,473
on different models, mental frameworks.

214
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:24,763
We are going to discuss today some mental
models and some example of mental models.

215
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:30,753
So this is one area where we
need to expand our knowledge.

216
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:34,013
Then we need to lay low on the ego
and be honest and ask for help and

217
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,463
accept that we are continuous students.

218
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:39,953
And we need to face and stay close
to the consequences of our decisions.

219
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:43,863
When we are making
decisions that we are not.

220
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:49,213
assuming the consequences for we
create that broken window effect, just

221
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:53,403
as an urban environments where one
broken window left unrepaired signals

222
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:55,503
lack of care and invites more damage.

223
00:13:56,183 --> 00:14:00,053
So also in our work, small
RSO issues in our code.

224
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:05,078
our mindset, our processes can accumulate,
leading to bigger problems over time.

225
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:09,488
If we don't address these issues
as early as possible, we're

226
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:14,248
just letting all sorts of poor
practices and blind spots take root.

227
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,738
So it becomes harder and
harder to solve problems.

228
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:23,898
And going further in the
perspective part, because this is

229
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:27,238
maybe the most powerful of them.

230
00:14:29,398 --> 00:14:31,038
You know how in school we are learning.

231
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:34,348
are learning about different areas, right?

232
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:41,578
We are learning about physics
and biology and math and all

233
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:43,138
psychology, economics and so on.

234
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:49,758
And we are, we've been learning
and creating this way of

235
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:51,488
thinking in departments, right?

236
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:56,458
But in the real world, we need to
combine these departments because

237
00:14:56,808 --> 00:15:01,043
problems in the real world are
not divide it so precisely, right?

238
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:04,573
So we need to work on our
multidisciplinary mindset, because

239
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:09,123
if we don't, we miss the full
picture of a problem, and our next

240
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:14,043
step is not going to be the, the
closest to the best, if not the best.

241
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:18,053
If a single worldview dominates
our thinking, we'll try to explain

242
00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:20,833
every problem through that lens,
even if it's not the right fit.

243
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:24,763
the old saying with, to the man with
only hammer, everything looks like

244
00:15:24,763 --> 00:15:29,298
a nail, but not It's not like this
in this, in this world, we need to

245
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:31,408
understand the complexity of the world.

246
00:15:31,828 --> 00:15:37,688
And we need to understand how important
it is to draw knowledge from, from

247
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:40,918
different models and different
perspectives and different fields.

248
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:45,218
And an example, and actually the
first mental model that I would

249
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:50,148
like us to discuss today is the
Swiss army knife approach, which is

250
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:53,068
Charlie Munger's way of thinking was
Charlie Munger's way of thinking.

251
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:57,508
Basically, he believed in having
wide, a wide range of mental models,

252
00:15:57,518 --> 00:16:00,568
similar to having many tools as
we have in a Swiss army knife.

253
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:04,848
And these metal models, of course,
come from different fields, from

254
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:09,238
different perspectives, and they
help us see challenges from different

255
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:14,778
approaches, approach them from different
angles, to find the best solutions.

256
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:18,938
And if we think if we're
going to a forest, real estate

257
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:19,868
agent and a yoga trainer.

258
00:16:19,868 --> 00:16:22,708
Of course, each of them is going
to see, a different perspective.

259
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:25,028
Maybe the botanist is going to
be marveled by the nature, right?

260
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:25,878
Exactly.

261
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:30,818
How about details from the nature and
appreciate it and think about how we

262
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:36,948
can, we need to keep this as untouched
by human action as possible and so on.

263
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:40,478
A real estate agent maybe thinking more
from the perspective of a business, right?

264
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:45,698
How he could sell this, how, this could
well, a very good place for having, a

265
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:47,608
building, a neighborhood, and so on.

266
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:50,728
Then your veterinarian might be
thinking about the energy and

267
00:16:50,728 --> 00:16:51,698
what is happening in your house.

268
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:55,308
Session would be so useful to have in
there, and to really let our bodies and

269
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:59,428
mind to, to use the energy from there
in order to have a great experience.

270
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:03,438
Each of these perspectives captures
a part, but not the whole picture.

271
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:08,208
And if we rely on a specific
discipline, we develop gaps.

272
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,368
Yeah, those blind spots
that we were talking about.

273
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:14,488
You can adapt, of course,
it is a confirmation bias,

274
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:15,748
which makes things even worse.

275
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:23,698
Next, a mental model that challenges to,
to look a bit at how we are, considering,

276
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:27,248
the materials that we are using or the
way that we are organizing our work is

277
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:33,168
the map is not a territory that refers to
the idea that abstractions like, diagrams

278
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:36,748
and some schemes, that we are doing, yeah.

279
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:42,158
or any representation are not
the same as the reality itself.

280
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:47,318
So any model or map that we create
to understand something is a

281
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:51,328
simplification and doesn't capture
every detail of real world system.

282
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:54,848
And this applies directly to software
development where we work with diagrams,

283
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:58,308
for example, and requirements and
models that not fully represent the

284
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:00,388
complexity of the system itself.

285
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:05,323
And we can think, for example,
Let's say we are, a very careful

286
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:09,883
developer, that follows, the project
specification, document closely.

287
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:16,013
But then when testing in production and,
having our solution in the real world, we

288
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,773
encounter some unexpected issues, right?

289
00:18:18,203 --> 00:18:21,993
So using this model helps us
recognize that the specification.

290
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,693
The document, the map, yeah, it's not
the same as the actual running system,

291
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:29,453
the territory, no matter how detailed
the specification is, it will miss some

292
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,593
real world behaviors or edge cases.

293
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:35,543
And by acknowledging
this, we remain cautious.

294
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:40,363
We implement retesting, including those
edge cases that we were mentioning,

295
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:44,283
to ensure that the actual software
performs as intended in the real world.

296
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:52,933
The third mental model that I
want us to touch today, it's

297
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,183
the second order thinking.

298
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,748
And I would like to start by

299
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:01,368
there is this effect
called the cobra effect.

300
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:04,858
Basically, the story goes that when
the British colonial government in

301
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:08,598
Delhi wanted to reduce the number
of cobras in the city, they offered

302
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:10,198
the bounty for every dead cobra.

303
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:14,188
Initially, this seemed like a good
idea, but in time, there were some

304
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,638
individuals that realized that
they could breed cobras and they'll

305
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:17,778
kill them for the bounty, right?

306
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:20,368
And increasing, of course, their profits.

307
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:23,613
This was not a good idea
since the government found

308
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:25,463
out and stopped the program.

309
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:30,483
Yeah, after discovered this unintended
consequence of their program.

310
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:35,553
And in response, the cobra breeders, of
course, having no use for the snakes,

311
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:40,203
they released them, causing the cobra
population to be even worse than before.

312
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:44,063
So this unintended outcome is
recognized as the cobra effect.

313
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:48,623
And actually, this is, if we look
carefully, we see the consequence and

314
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:51,393
that the consequence of our decisions
in the consequences of our decisions.

315
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:56,113
And this is exactly what the second order,
thinking mental model, patches, because it

316
00:19:56,113 --> 00:20:00,083
encourages us to look beyond the immediate
consequences to understand their long

317
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,343
term effects, as well as ripple effects
that might arouse from these decisions.

318
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:06,103
And let's again, take an
example in software development.

319
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:09,543
Let's say that we are part of a
team that is being assigned to

320
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,623
work with, e commerce platform, right?

321
00:20:14,623 --> 00:20:15,963
Of course.

322
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:20,578
thing that we do, we are focusing
on delivering the, the core

323
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:22,528
functionality of the platform, maybe.

324
00:20:22,528 --> 00:20:25,188
Ensuring that the basic features
like, think first, right?

325
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:30,118
Basic features like product search,
checkout, payment, work smoothly, right?

326
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:34,378
Maybe we even think about, okay, let's
prioritize performance and speed to

327
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:37,058
give users a fast browsing experience.

328
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:39,428
This is the first thing that
we are considering, right?

329
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:40,858
When we are here in e commerce, okay.

330
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:43,528
But these are the first order.

331
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:44,258
thinking.

332
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:47,388
This is an example, again,
take it with a grain of salt.

333
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,768
But if we go a bit more into
details, we can actually consider

334
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:53,418
those second order effects, yeah?

335
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,018
We can start thinking beyond the
immediate functional requirements and

336
00:20:57,018 --> 00:21:02,158
think, okay, but what happens if spikes,
if traffic spikes dramatically, yeah?

337
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:05,208
What happens if part of the system fails?

338
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,048
For example, the payment.

339
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:07,668
component.

340
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:13,718
And if I have to add new features,
features to this, will it be easy?

341
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:15,738
Will it be, hard for
the business to evolve?

342
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:16,468
How things will be?

343
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:20,058
By asking this kind of question, so
going a bit beyond to the second order

344
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:26,308
concerns, we can see other, important
factors surface, like scalability,

345
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:29,218
the need for availability and fault
tolerance, performance under load,

346
00:21:29,218 --> 00:21:30,588
security and compliance and so on.

347
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:37,678
This, this mental model helps us
exercise, considering the ripple effects

348
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:42,778
of our decisions, and help us identify
and prioritize characteristics that

349
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:44,878
will ensure long term success, right?

350
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:49,188
It prevents us from focusing on
short term functional goals and,

351
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:55,598
helps us handle future challenges and
opportunities with minimal, disruptions.

352
00:21:56,598 --> 00:22:00,668
an interesting part about, about
us, and we are discussing before,

353
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:05,068
about this when talking about blind
spots is that we cannot understand

354
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:06,238
a system that we are a part of.

355
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:10,478
And relativity involves understanding
that things are not absolute and often

356
00:22:10,478 --> 00:22:11,818
depend on context or perspective.

357
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:17,288
So my all time favorite example or
situation for this is when we have

358
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:20,988
to choose from or technology language
and application for an application.

359
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:23,468
Doesn't matter technology
language approach.

360
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:24,068
Doesn't matter.

361
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:28,718
I remember some years ago, we were
not sure if this dispute since

362
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:31,198
Phil is, but there is what is best.

363
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:32,468
The net or Java?

364
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:33,308
What is best?

365
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:35,808
React or Angular.

366
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:37,938
Which is the best, has the best approach?

367
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:39,768
How we are going to work with it?

368
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:42,398
things like this, like what
has the most advantages?

369
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:43,978
What, which one is the best?

370
00:22:43,998 --> 00:22:44,548
Where?

371
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,538
instead of asking what's the best
programming language, how about, I

372
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:51,458
think, what is the best programming
language for this specific project?

373
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:55,128
The best language is relative
to the skill set of the team,

374
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:56,718
projects, requirements, timeframe.

375
00:22:56,728 --> 00:22:58,268
There's no absolute best answer.

376
00:22:58,318 --> 00:23:00,958
What matters is the context
in which the decision is made.

377
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:06,918
Then, instead of always striving for
brilliance or perfection, it's often more

378
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,968
effective to focus on avoiding mistakes.

379
00:23:09,418 --> 00:23:12,268
In the context of software, for example,
this could mean focusing on common

380
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:13,888
pitfalls and making sure to avoid them.

381
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:16,028
For example,

382
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:20,878
let's say that you have a deadline.

383
00:23:21,378 --> 00:23:22,458
a very aggressive deadline.

384
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:23,998
You did not expect this.

385
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:26,248
Things have changed in the
project, what we are going to do.

386
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,458
Instead of thinking, okay,
what are the best practices to

387
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,078
follow to meet this deadline?

388
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:37,803
those magazines that are giving you 10
steps to Be the best manager, 10 steps

389
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:39,973
to be a productive developer, and so on.

390
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:44,053
Instead of looking for these 10 steps
to ensure that we meet the deadline,

391
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:46,503
how about we apply inversion, right?

392
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:49,643
And ask what common mistakes
we need to avoid that could

393
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:50,793
make us miss the deadline.

394
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:53,663
What did we do the last time
when we missed the deadline?

395
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:54,883
Let's avoid doing that.

396
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:56,243
Start from that point.

397
00:23:57,013 --> 00:24:00,523
Then, by deliberately avoiding
these common mistakes, you increase

398
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,643
the chances of success rather than
just looking for the best way to

399
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:04,853
do it without being validated.

400
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:09,353
You already validated what are the worst,
the worst things that you can do to not

401
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:11,553
beat the deadline for sure in the past.

402
00:24:12,103 --> 00:24:12,783
Start from there.

403
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:16,873
Focus on ensuring that simple
errors don't derail the project.

404
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:24,148
Then moving forward, you know how we
have this tendency of Thinking that

405
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:27,258
the more complicated something, or
the problem that you're fixing, or the

406
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:31,129
more complicated the solution that we
are giving you, the more complex, the

407
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:35,921
more important we are because we don't
know the same thing as everyone else.

408
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:39,631
So we end up becoming really good at
something specific just to stand out.

409
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:45,311
And sometimes we actually find or
look for complex, resolutions for

410
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:48,931
our problems just to make sure that
others can easily understand it.

411
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:52,076
But besides that, to make
sure that we stand out.

412
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:54,276
with our complex way of looking at things.

413
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:58,266
Or Occam's Razor is a concept that
suggests that when faced with multiple

414
00:24:58,316 --> 00:25:02,156
competing solutions, the best starting
point is to start with the simplest one.

415
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:08,496
If your project is not, explicitly
asking for the most complex solution,

416
00:25:08,496 --> 00:25:09,906
start with the, with the simplest one.

417
00:25:11,446 --> 00:25:13,486
And we have a lot of examples in software.

418
00:25:13,526 --> 00:25:17,396
I'm sure that you've been thinking
about at least three since I

419
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:18,966
opened the conversation about this.

420
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:24,466
But what I can say to wrap up this is
to avoid over engineering solutions in

421
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:29,986
both development, design, architecture,
design for simplicity and usability

422
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:35,076
and focus on straightforward solution
during debugging and problem solving.

423
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:39,526
And a simple, more focused
approach is easier to use and

424
00:25:39,526 --> 00:25:40,666
it's easier to build upon.

425
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:44,266
So of course, again, take it
with a grain of salt, check the

426
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:47,736
context of your situation, problem.

427
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:55,086
whatever it is, and try to build step by
step to see exactly what kind of approach

428
00:25:55,086 --> 00:26:00,486
you need to do, but don't respond out of
ego, which we're mentioning a bit before.

429
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:06,606
Of course, we've touched today
some mental models, and there

430
00:26:06,616 --> 00:26:07,556
are a lot of mental models.

431
00:26:07,556 --> 00:26:11,536
I actually encourage you to look on
it and see, but it's not about knowing

432
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,446
them, knowing as many as possible.

433
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,846
It's about being open and learning.

434
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:22,511
Yeah, we need to move away from solving
immediate tasks and start thinking

435
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:25,011
holistically about the systems we build.

436
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:30,131
And these kind of models help us navigate
complexity and make better decisions.

437
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:35,871
And they allow us to design software that
does not only solve current problems, but

438
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:38,291
is adaptable for future growth and change.

439
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,581
So I'm going to leave you with this
beautiful quote from Alexander, which I

440
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:45,041
think it's the essence of a developer's
mindset, When you build a thing, you

441
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:47,161
cannot merely build a thing in isolation.

442
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:48,761
You must repair the world around it.

443
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:53,561
understanding that every piece of
software contributes to a larger system.

444
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:57,321
So just to close the
circle, build castles.

445
00:26:57,321 --> 00:26:58,431
Don't just break castles.

446
00:26:58,431 --> 00:26:59,621
Don't just break stones.

447
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,031
Think about your, your
work from this perspective.

448
00:27:02,651 --> 00:27:06,111
I want to very much for staying with
me today and for listening to my talk.

449
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:09,271
I hope that I was able to.

450
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:13,086
to open some question for you or
some areas that you would like

451
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:16,806
to explore further and, yeah,
reach out and let's discuss.

452
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:18,146
Thank you very much.
