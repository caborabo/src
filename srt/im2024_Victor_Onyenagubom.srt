00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,500
Hello, my name is Victor
really lovely to meet you guys.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,915
today I'll be speaking on a topic
called react and respond How to enhance

3
00:00:08,995 --> 00:00:11,395
incident management with cyber awareness.

4
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:14,305
It's really important for
you to understand that cyber

5
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:19,224
awareness plays a crucial role
enhancing incident management.

6
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:22,604
Whether you're talking about incident
management for a small incident

7
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:24,594
or for a very large incident.

8
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:29,209
How cyber aware your employees or
your teammates or your colleagues are.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,490
Plays a very big role as regards how
you are able to like bounce back and,

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,729
move on with your business continuity
plan in the case of an incident.

11
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:42,040
So looking at, this in
depth today quickly.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,370
First of all, it's important for us to
understand that the cyber threat landscape

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,920
keeps increasing, and the tactics being
used by cyber criminals keep evolving.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,389
They're on the, with the advent
of AI, generative AI, there's the

15
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,889
attack surface keeps increasing.

16
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,214
And of course, There's a target variety
in the sense that different, there are so

17
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:07,584
many, soft targets, so many people that
could be targeted from small businesses

18
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,844
to hospitals and, manufacturing,
any organization could be a target.

19
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:15,954
So hence the need to be cyber
aware, there's also financial

20
00:01:15,954 --> 00:01:20,844
impact if an organization falls
victim to a cyber security attack.

21
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,614
Obviously it will cause downtime.

22
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:27,684
And if it's, for instance, if it's
a ransomware attack, it could also

23
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:31,974
have some financial impact where the
malicious attacker could ask for some

24
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:36,234
money before they actually give that
organization access to their data.

25
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:39,394
And sometimes even after paying
some organizations are not still

26
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:40,504
sure of getting their data.

27
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:44,504
So the cyber threat landscape
is really, evolving every day.

28
00:01:44,784 --> 00:01:49,894
There's also the issue of data privacy,
with the cyber security attack, the

29
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:51,814
data you have, your sensitive data.

30
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:55,044
is compromised and data
privacy is also compromised.

31
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:59,634
So it's very important for us
to, have a cyber aware culture.

32
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:00,554
very important.

33
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:05,314
So what is important cyber awareness
for incident response, early detection.

34
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:09,554
If you have employees who are
cyber aware, they'll be more

35
00:02:09,554 --> 00:02:11,024
likely to be more eagle eyed.

36
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:14,894
They'll be more likely to spot
inconsistencies, which could

37
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:16,494
actually lead to a cyber attack.

38
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:16,924
Okay.

39
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:19,534
They'll be able to spot
suspicious activities.

40
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:23,764
For instance, if you've trained your
staffs on how to identify a phishing

41
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:28,089
email, it'll be easy for them to,
identify, Efficient email some day

42
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:30,709
and let you know that okay, we're
receiving efficient email from this

43
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:34,909
particular email and stuff like
that You can actually mitigate it.

44
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:39,599
So with Cyber awareness you are
able to effectively mitigate

45
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,084
cyber attacks In your environment.

46
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:44,934
Also, there's also going
to be reduced risk.

47
00:02:44,984 --> 00:02:48,164
because remember that we are not just
talking about technical measures because

48
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:53,214
most companies invest so much in their
technical security, spend billions of

49
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,794
pounds in their technical security, but
they don't do enough to make sure that

50
00:02:56,794 --> 00:02:59,184
their staffs are cyber aware, right?

51
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:00,834
because your staffs are
your human firewall.

52
00:03:00,844 --> 00:03:05,094
So you want to make sure that your staffs
are well trained and they are cyber aware

53
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:07,774
to understand the threats that cyber.

54
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:11,564
that malicious actor
posed to your business.

55
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:16,024
when we talk about cyber security
awareness, what comes to mind will

56
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:20,694
be employee training and continuous
education is very important for you

57
00:03:21,354 --> 00:03:26,359
as part of the induction for your
staffs to give them a very good

58
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,339
and robust cyber security training.

59
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:28,729
Okay.

60
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:32,946
Let them have a good understanding
of common cyber security threats and

61
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,589
cyber security best practices, and
let them have an understanding of

62
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:39,059
the instance response procedures.

63
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:40,639
If you would fall to an attack.

64
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:45,274
Also, you also need to encourage your
staff to update your system regularly

65
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:50,044
because and open the softwares you use
because, with updates, the vendors of

66
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:53,744
those software are able to get patches
wherever these softwares are vulnerable.

67
00:03:54,004 --> 00:03:57,084
The vendors are able to like those
patches with the updates, you

68
00:03:57,084 --> 00:04:01,704
will get a security patch for the
software and practical exercise.

69
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:06,329
Part of your Employee training should
also involve maybe gamifying your

70
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:10,329
trainings in a way that you could
simulate real world scenarios and to

71
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:14,699
make it to be more interesting to your
employees who are participating in

72
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,909
this training so that they can actually
get a hands on experience as regards.

73
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:18,299
Okay.

74
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:21,279
What's the entails when there's
a cyber crime, what do I do?

75
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,229
What do I not do?

76
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:22,899
Okay.

77
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:26,549
It's also important that when you run
this training, you want to get feedback,

78
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:29,039
maybe survey, you want to observe, and.

79
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,819
Axios, trainees, what worked,
what didn't work, so that you can

80
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:35,929
actually keep improving it because,
cybersecurity awareness training

81
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:39,099
is not something that is not just
something you just do in a rigid manner.

82
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,129
You have to be flexible.

83
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,349
You have to keep changing.

84
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,669
You have to keep making it
better based on feedback.

85
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:45,289
So it's very good.

86
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:49,614
practice to always get feedback after
a cyber security awareness training,

87
00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:56,725
then how do you also need to implement
a robust incident response plan so that

88
00:04:56,815 --> 00:05:01,485
if you were to actually fall to a cyber
attack, you want to have players and

89
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:05,055
responsibilities, who's going to handle
what, who's going to call, the police.

90
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:07,875
Who's going to inform the ICO
that there's been a data breach?

91
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:09,945
Who's going to do what and all that?

92
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:14,295
who's going to speak to the, the press,
as regards the extent of the data breach,

93
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,255
do you have a legal team in place?

94
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:17,105
things like that.

95
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:21,375
So you want to have, you want to have, an
established procedure as regards how you

96
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,255
want to, handle your incident response.

97
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:26,755
And communication is really key,
for example, for you, especially

98
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:29,425
for your staff who may be working
remotely, if they find out that

99
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:31,525
they've been hacked or something, your.

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,810
Staffs are supposed to have a, a clear,
and a response, a rapid and responsive

101
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,650
communication channel through which they
can actually contact you as their manager

102
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,730
or maybe their CEO that, okay, this is
the, this is what we are going through.

103
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,320
We've been hacked and stuff like
that, so having a good communication

104
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,660
strategy can also help you in
terms of an incident management.

105
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:59,885
Then you obviously so many organizations
is already, utilizing, automation

106
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:04,205
and automation and AI tools for
fast detection endpoint security.

107
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:08,430
Basically, we have to this is like
the, the CrowdStrike Falcon go,

108
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,600
tools like that can be used cloud
solutions like the Falcon go.

109
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,480
Can be used by small businesses,
medium businesses, and, you can

110
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,770
use those solutions like AI driven
Sentinel one, carbon black, there's

111
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,320
so many solutions you can use for
trade detection and elimination.

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,170
Okay.

113
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,490
So you want to actually make use of those.

114
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,330
If you can actually afford it
and use those for Monitoring the

115
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,710
networks of your vulnerabilities
and keeping your system safe.

116
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,100
So it is very important to foster
a culture of cyber resilience.

117
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:50,180
When we talk about incident response
management, your staffs, your people

118
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,010
who work for you, your employees
have to be, have to need, have

119
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,590
needs to have security awareness.

120
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,490
They need to have security awareness.

121
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,510
And how do you do this?

122
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,230
You do this by communicating best
practices and also promoting.

123
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:07,685
A culture of openness where your employees
feel free to communicate with you, where

124
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:11,635
there's no barrier, they are willing to
be open with you to discuss with you.

125
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:14,895
There should also be a facilitation
of information sharing.

126
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,065
Each department, if there's an information
that could help one department, maybe the

127
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:22,145
accounting department should be able to
share information as regards cybersecurity

128
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:23,575
to the engineering department.

129
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:25,535
If they know that is going to help them.

130
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,880
Mitigate their cybersecurity challenges.

131
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,690
Like I said in the previous slide,
continuous learning is very important.

132
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,750
You should be conducting a
cybersecurity awareness training

133
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,010
regularly for your team.

134
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,930
you shouldn't just say, Oh, I'm going
to be doing this just once again.

135
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,750
You, the cyber attackers
are not really sleeping.

136
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,320
They are also innovating.

137
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,810
They are also improving.

138
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,950
So you want to also make sure that
your human firewalls, which are

139
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,756
your staffs, are also improving
in terms of their cyber awareness.

140
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:55,070
So continuous training is very important.

141
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,680
Okay.

142
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,340
So in conclusion and the key
takeaway, what you need to understand

143
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,460
is that cyber security awareness
is not just a one time thing.

144
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,540
It's an ongoing process as we
keep on discovering new and

145
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,930
new vulnerabilities every day.

146
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,390
Individuals need to also stay on top of
their game and keep, learning and keep

147
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,460
knowing, okay, these are the tricks,
these are the tips and tricks, I can

148
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,440
use to stay safe from cyber attacks.

149
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,750
And employee training and
continuous education, like I said

150
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,005
in this It is a non negotiable.

151
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:27,145
It is important to carry out
employee training regularly.

152
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:30,835
Also, you can also use,
endpoint security tools.

153
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,655
Like I spoke about Falcon.

154
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:37,365
I spoke about Sentinel 1 to protect
your technical, in terms of your

155
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:41,025
technical security, so that you
can protect your attack surface.

156
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:45,345
And you also need to foster
an atmosphere of openness.

157
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,200
Within your staff so that they can
always talk to you and open up to you.

158
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,510
If they feel something isn't right,
they can always talk to you and you can,

159
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,720
mitigate that challenge immediately.

160
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,860
with that, you don't be
proactively to handle, incidents.

161
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,340
So I thank you for listening to me and
thank you for listening to this talk.

162
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:10,055
I hope you actually enjoy this and I hope
you actually learn something from it.

163
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:12,905
Cyber security remains
everybody's business.

164
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:15,165
It's not just the cyber
security analyst business.

165
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:16,455
It is your own business too.

166
