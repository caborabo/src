1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,900
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,550
My name is Dmitry Tarayev.

3
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:21,719
I'm currently a Flutter
developer at Quadcode.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,550
today I would like to speak about
Flutter versus native app development.

5
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:34,305
From a point of view of a former native
mobile app developer, that's me, I used

6
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:39,025
to develop for iOS, and then I switched
to cross platform framework Flutter.

7
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:43,784
So today, first, I'll speak
a little about myself.

8
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:52,304
Then I'll speak about Flutter in general,
the problem, the pros and cons of Flutter.

9
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:56,694
Then we'll do a quick technical
comparison of Flutter and iOS.

10
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:04,455
I'll also speak about my practical
experience using Flutter and, then

11
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:10,914
what alternatives there exists
and summary about my experience.

12
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:12,294
Okay.

13
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:13,935
A few words about myself.

14
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,205
My name is Mithut Tarayev.

15
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:19,235
I used to be an iOS developer.

16
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:25,705
I took part in one of the biggest music
apps in Russia, which is VK music.

17
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:29,164
And a few other projects in VK.

18
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:33,414
And a big part of my career
was also in teaching.

19
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:40,925
I taught a few courses on app development
in Moscow State Technical University.

20
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:43,345
I did an iOS development course.

21
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:49,475
And then when I switched to developing
using Flutter, I also did some

22
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:53,815
teaching at Moscow State University
and a lecture in Apollos University.

23
00:01:57,045 --> 00:02:05,645
I switched in 2019 and my first
big project was Yandex pro it's

24
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:09,534
a driving app, for Yandex taxi.

25
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:14,725
So that's the app used by drivers,
but not only drivers also by

26
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:20,975
couriers, which bring food like
Uber, Uber eats something like that.

27
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:26,235
So it's, an app useful used
by drivers and couriers.

28
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:29,685
and the team was really huge.

29
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:34,705
I was a part of big team, but
after that I joined a startup.

30
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:36,195
it's called blush.

31
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:40,055
The idea was to make a
AI dating, simulator.

32
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:42,315
So that's what we did.

33
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:46,014
Here's a few screenshots
and a QR code to the,

34
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,375
so what is Flutter?

35
00:02:51,925 --> 00:02:55,785
Flutter is one of the frameworks
for cross platform mobile app

36
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:59,005
development, made by Google.

37
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:07,320
It uses Dart programming language and it,
and these projects made using Flutter can

38
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:11,070
be built into several major platforms.

39
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:19,019
major mobile apps, Android and
iOS, as well as web and desktop.

40
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,300
you could ask me, why do
we need cross platform?

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,680
There's already iOS, Android,
and there are lots of

42
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,369
developers who are used to them.

43
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:39,024
But in many cases, it may be more cost
efficient and convenient to develop a

44
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:42,194
cross platform app because it's faster.

45
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,215
not two times faster because
you're making one app, but still

46
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:51,834
significantly faster than two separate
apps, developing two separate apps.

47
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:58,175
Then also, because of that, it's
cheaper, it requires less developers.

48
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,070
It's a bit more difficult to
find developers, but comparing

49
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,000
to the native app development,
but still it's not too difficult.

50
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:12,600
And considering quality, it
works reliably, but the app might

51
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,920
look a bit different from the
native apps, especially in iOS.

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,200
And, it might be important
depending on what app you're doing.

53
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,430
So from the developer point of view,
what do we get when we use Flutter?

54
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,270
We get hot reload and hot restart,
which is super convenient options.

55
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,659
when you're making an app, you have to
rebuild the project many, times when you

56
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:47,270
make changes, but having hot reload and,
it, it makes almost instantly, you just

57
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,880
save it and it hot reloads and you see
the changes, when you change the color

58
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,669
of widgets or change phones, this type
of thing, or do you change the layout?

59
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:03,365
For bigger changes, it might require
to do a hot restart, which might

60
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:08,474
take few minutes, a few seconds,
but it's not too long as well.

61
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:15,704
So it, reduces the, time
it takes to do the rebuild.

62
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:19,635
So you don't need to do complete
rebuilds of the projects that often.

63
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:28,205
So it also, while you lay out, widgets
and flatter, it uses declarative ui.

64
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,320
and it's, it looks quite simple.

65
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,870
It looks very nice and it's much more
easier than doing layout in code in iOS.

66
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,929
At least it used to before,
SwiftUI, came into view.

67
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,740
And from architectural point of
view, it's also quite convenient.

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,020
It's very easy to modularize the app.

69
00:05:55,735 --> 00:06:00,925
and make each feature in different
module or different components and you

70
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:06,685
can reuse them in different parts of
the app or even in different projects.

71
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:13,584
so from the technical point, you
can see, like the difference between

72
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:15,574
declarative and imperative approach.

73
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:19,055
on the left, we have declarative approach.

74
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:22,985
On the right, we have imperative
approach, which is used, which

75
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:25,425
was used in iOS before SwiftUI.

76
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:32,775
And here on the left, it's how it's
done, like the text view, how it's

77
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:40,684
shown in Flutter, which looks very
nice and clean and, easy to use.

78
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:46,395
Another big part of Flutter
is that everything is widgets.

79
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:52,385
You have a huge collection of widgets
using which you can customize them,

80
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:54,745
you can use them to make your own app.

81
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:01,504
few other like technical things.

82
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:03,724
Dart works in a single thread.

83
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:12,145
But there are ways to make, to execute
code on other threads using isolates.

84
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:20,524
And also it's very convenient to work
with asynchrony using async await calls.

85
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,205
It's, very well done and
it's very easy to use.

86
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:32,545
If we look at Flutter pros from a
product owner's point of view from

87
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:37,145
a product, what we get if we use
Flutter comparing with native apps.

88
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:43,670
It is faster, as I said before, like
you make only one app, use a single

89
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,310
code base instead of two separate apps.

90
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,179
So it requires less
developers and it's cheaper.

91
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,130
and as I said, we have a single code
base, so that gives us an opportunity to

92
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:04,289
have releases on both platforms at the
same time, and also the versions would

93
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:09,645
be the same, which can be a problem
if you have, native apps and Each

94
00:08:09,664 --> 00:08:13,815
native app is developed by a separate
team of iOS and Android developers.

95
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:19,905
But as always, there are some
drawbacks from using Flutter.

96
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:25,224
for a developer, one of them is
obvious is that you have to learn

97
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:30,364
a new framework and a programming
language, but that's just life.

98
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:35,505
then there is a smaller demand for
Flutter developers on the market.

99
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,659
And it's not enough to only
learn about Flutter development.

100
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,489
You also have to be very familiar
with platforms, ideally both

101
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,819
platforms, at least one iOS or
Android, because sometimes you have

102
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,210
to get deeper into the platform code.

103
00:08:54,829 --> 00:09:00,600
For example, if there's, some SDK
you want to use and SDK only exists

104
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,820
for iOS and Android, and you need
to use it in your Flutter app, you

105
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,570
have to write to the plugin, which.

106
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:12,355
just, uses that SDK on both platforms.

107
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:16,795
It is obviously possible and it's
not too difficult, but you have to

108
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:18,535
understand how the platforms work.

109
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:24,685
You might experience some strange
bugs, which are associated with a

110
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:30,224
release of new versions, Android
or iOS, mostly iOS or a new Xcode.

111
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:34,775
As iOS is decay, and as I said.

112
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:40,005
You there might be missing the SDKs
you need so you have to make a plug

113
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:45,124
in yourself, but there is a huge
amount of Already made plugins.

114
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:49,175
So you might find the one you
need and not make it yourself

115
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:59,005
from a product point of view The
app It might be a disadvantage that

116
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:04,085
the app can look different from
the native apps Especially on iOS,

117
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:12,535
scroll can feel different or some
UI might feel different from the

118
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:18,974
like typical UI, which is used,
which the users are used to on iOS.

119
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:26,535
Also, I've experienced some
problems with animation lags, but

120
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:28,185
there are ways to overcome them.

121
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:32,595
And, I think this shouldn't
be an issue nowadays.

122
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:37,109
And also there are not too many
Flutter developers, so it might be

123
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,649
easy, not be so easy for you as a,
for example, for a startup or a big

124
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,069
company to find, good developers.

125
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:56,569
and some of my views in, for, situations
where you should or shouldn't use Flutter.

126
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,329
I think you, it's ideal for quick MVPs.

127
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,949
Or the app that should look
the same on both platforms.

128
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,060
And also keep in mind that
you have free web with it.

129
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:17,230
So the app can be built for web 2
or desktop apps if you need them.

130
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,770
And probably a few situations
when you shouldn't use Flutter or

131
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,249
consider it really thoughtfully.

132
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,850
for example, if you
already have a native app.

133
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:35,194
iOS or Android, and you need to
do an app for the second platform.

134
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:38,955
And for example, you already
have like native app developers.

135
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:44,295
So that may, it might be a case
where you don't need to rewrite

136
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:47,644
all the apps, using Flutter.

137
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:53,874
but I do have a successful experience
of switching to Flutter in such cases.

138
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:56,014
And there are two cases I've experienced.

139
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,480
There is a requirement for the
app to look exactly like a native

140
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,150
iOS app, like to follow all the
Apple human interface guidelines.

141
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:12,850
so it might be very difficult
and maybe even impossible to

142
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,469
make such an app using Flutter.

143
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:21,420
So about the practical experience
I've had, implementing Flutter.

144
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,790
The first was Yandex Pro, as I said,
that's the app for drivers and queries.

145
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,455
I joined the team in 2019.

146
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:42,115
Actually, it was the new team Hired
to do the iOS app, but it wasn't

147
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:50,115
we had like long deadlines and We
decided to try the cross platform.

148
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:56,709
We tried the React Native first, but we
had some problems, with our security,

149
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,050
department and they said not to use it.

150
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:06,589
And we decided to try Flutter instead
and all the team really enjoyed using it.

151
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:12,360
And, eventually the decision was made
that we should use it in this prospect of.

152
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:16,505
Replacing the former native Android app.

153
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:25,305
in 2020, we released the app with
the basic functionality for iOS.

154
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:32,064
And the native app for Android still
existed and still was, developing.

155
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:35,895
Because we couldn't just stop
development for Android apps.

156
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:39,615
It was used by, I don't know, like
thousands and thousands of users.

157
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:40,814
So we couldn't stop it.

158
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:48,344
so our goal was to catch up with
the native app's functionality.

159
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:54,750
And at the time there was also new
functionality being developed, so it was

160
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,950
developed simultaneously for the native
Android app and for our Flutter app.

161
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:07,160
And while doing that we wrote few
plugins for SDKs that we needed,

162
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,860
the map, Yandex Map SDK, which was,

163
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,340
biggest part of the app probably.

164
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,460
And, because it's on the main screen and
there's so many functionality in that map.

165
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:25,715
Routing, different points,
different layers, everything.

166
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:31,665
There are so many things there, camera,
audio, Bluetooth, these types of things.

167
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:36,595
They were, the SDKs that we used and
we had to write plugins for them.

168
00:14:37,854 --> 00:14:43,045
And eventually in 2022, we managed
to switch to a single code base.

169
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:48,204
So we caught up with the native
apps functionality on Android and.

170
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:58,205
At one point that Android app was
replaced in, Google play, by the

171
00:14:58,205 --> 00:15:00,765
new Flutter app built for Android.

172
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:07,664
So for the users, it was just like
update, but for us, it was a huge

173
00:15:07,664 --> 00:15:10,345
change and it was really successful.

174
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:16,345
my second experience was
with a much smaller project.

175
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,955
We had a smaller team.

176
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:19,835
It was three people.

177
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:24,705
And in the previous project, it was
up to, I think about 40 developers.

178
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:26,075
So it was a huge project.

179
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:27,915
This was much smaller.

180
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:30,215
I came, I was the second in the team.

181
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:37,264
so the situation we had was
opposite to the one we had, I had

182
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:39,995
before, so we had a native iOS app.

183
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,920
And we had no Android app yet.

184
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,800
And we began writing an
application in Flutter with the

185
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,880
idea to replace the iOS app.

186
00:15:53,359 --> 00:16:00,620
And initially we just built it
only for Android and we were

187
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,050
going and trying to catch up with
the native app functionality.

188
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,170
So in 2023, we released our Android app.

189
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:19,474
And, after that, we still continue
to develop new features for both

190
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:26,185
for the native, iOS app and for
the Flutter app built for Android.

191
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:35,044
And only in the beginning of 2024,
after all the holidays, we came to the

192
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:42,304
point where we migrated the iOS users
to the new Flutter app built for iOS.

193
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:48,560
Which wasn't that easy because,
the initial, the, native iOS app

194
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,849
was built using Firebase, database.

195
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,210
And there was a lot of stuff saved
locally and it doesn't, didn't use

196
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:03,530
any backend, so that was quite a task,
but we finished it and nowadays the,

197
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,609
blush app, if you download it, it's the
same app on iOS and Android built on

198
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:13,670
Flutter, And it was really successful.

199
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,090
So let's look at the few cross
platform options that we have.

200
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:27,490
This is quite a recent chart and Flutter
seems to be the most popular nowadays.

201
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,479
the React Native is very close.

202
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,290
and briefly I mentioned
like few other options.

203
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
So we have Flutter.

204
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:44,565
Then there's Cordova and Ionic,
which use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

205
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:50,035
Then there's React Native, which
uses native widgets with wrappers

206
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:53,674
while Flutter uses Skia engine.

207
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:59,945
And in React Native, it uses
JavaScript virtual machine, while

208
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:02,615
in Flutter, we have binary code.

209
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:04,705
And.

210
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:08,695
But React Native might be very
useful because, you're writing

211
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:12,775
JavaScript and there's much more
JavaScript developers than there

212
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:15,425
are Flutter developers, obviously.

213
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:20,354
but potentially it might have
a lower performance and some

214
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:24,785
security issues because it's a
JavaScript virtual machine, right?

215
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:25,935
Especially on iOS.

216
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:32,725
then there is also Kotlin multi
platform, which is growing

217
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,375
and it looks very promising.

218
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,895
I just had a brief view
on what they offer.

219
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:43,514
And then there is Formal Xamarin,
which, now switched to NET MAUI.

220
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:48,145
It's not very popular yet, but
it also doesn't look too bad.

221
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:56,065
concluding my speech, I would
say that I've had a very

222
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,935
positive experience with Flutter.

223
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:04,540
It successfully replaced native apps,
both in a huge project and, with a

224
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,049
huge team of developers, and then
also with a smaller app and a small

225
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:17,619
team, the, framework, growing, is
growing and, it's being supported

226
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:19,940
and it's being more and more popular.

227
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:27,050
and there is a huge market for cross
platform development, using it for

228
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,590
MVPs, for startups, and you can even
use it in huge and very complex apps.

229
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:40,990
I know this is a recorded speech, but if
you want to, if you have any questions

230
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:46,900
about my experience, about Flutter in
general, you can text me on Telegram,

231
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,999
and email me, or text me on Twitter.

232
00:19:50,515 --> 00:19:54,165
Oh, there is also a link,
a QR code for my LinkedIn.

233
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:57,715
So welcome to join, and send me a text.

234
00:19:58,555 --> 00:19:59,945
