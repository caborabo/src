1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,380
Hello everyone, and thank
you for joining today.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,319
I'm Spyros Konoumakis, Director of
Product Operations at Mattermost, and

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,740
I'm leading the Infrastructure and
Customer Reliability Engineering teams.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,440
As you can understand, there's a
lot of incident management here.

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,559
And we're going to explore today
how AI can help the SRE teams to

6
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:19,509
manage incidents better, right?

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,049
And a bit more efficient.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,310
And as we know, every minute
of downtime matters, right?

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,229
As it can lead to SLA breaches.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,730
Which means service gets to our customers.

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,589
So AI potentially can help us take
some control of the cows and improve

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,740
the way we respond to incidents.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,520
If you ever been on
call, it's tough, right?

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,449
A call in the middle of the night
disrupts your sleep, messes with

15
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:48,760
your focus and adds a lot of stress.

16
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:53,935
There is you are under pressure to
solve multiple problems at once.

17
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:55,795
There is a lot of
multitasking at this time.

18
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:59,664
So these incidents don't
just stress us out, right?

19
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,154
There's other things which are happening.

20
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:04,424
They also slow down the innovation
because there's a constant

21
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:06,105
firefighting done building.

22
00:01:06,744 --> 00:01:14,375
So let's look how the severity incidents
and why are such high pressure situations.

23
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:17,155
As we discussed.

24
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:19,275
Everything happens at once.

25
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:20,645
There's a lot of multitasking.

26
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:25,775
So you need to find the root cause,
update internal teams, provide customer

27
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:33,694
updates, and all of this while you need to
check dashboards, logs, metrics, support

28
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:37,265
issues which are coming from the support
team, customer success are complaining.

29
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,465
So it can be really overwhelming.

30
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:45,900
But what if AI, could help us to
manage this complexity a bit better and

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,930
empower us to make a few things faster?

32
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,660
Before diving into how AI can help,
let's understand what AI can really do

33
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,979
because it's important to understand how
exactly it's going to empower the teams.

34
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,440
As you can see also in this slide,
AI can work across different types of

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,710
data from text, image, audio, video.

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,220
And by connecting all of these, it
gives us a better, bigger picture.

37
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,680
So in practice, AI doesn't
replace our decision making.

38
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,770
Still, we're going to decide what
it's going to say in the end,

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,700
what will be the next action.

40
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,779
But instead, it can empower us
with faster, better decisions.

41
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,560
More informed insights based on
the data we're going to provide.

42
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,150
So let's see how this
works in a real incident.

43
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,630
Imagine this.

44
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:37,825
It's 2 a.

45
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,155
m.

46
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:44,145
You have the perfect REM sleep and you
get paid with a high CPU alert for X

47
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:49,185
component You know You wake up by the
scary alarming sound from PagerDuty

48
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:52,284
or Opgenie or whatever tool you are
using And I believe everyone here

49
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:56,405
actually has gone through this Wondering
it, it's, Oh my God, is this real?

50
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:57,395
What's going to break?

51
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:02,855
And, you're sleepy, you're going to your
desk and sit down, turn on the laptop

52
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:04,664
and just start checking what's going on.

53
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:10,225
And if you are lucky, you have already
a pretty fine process, and this is

54
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:12,045
actually your incident response process.

55
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:15,465
And based on this, you need
to start doing some actions.

56
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:21,765
In our case, we use modern most
playbooks feature to make sure everything

57
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,725
is organized right from the start.

58
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:28,674
We run the playbook and this sets
up an incident tunnel algorithm

59
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,635
so everyone can communicate in
one centralized place, right?

60
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:34,105
So communication is key.

61
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:37,285
In this kind of situation,
it's very crucial 'cause things

62
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:38,484
slip through the cracks, right?

63
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:41,155
And to miscommunication, delays, fixes.

64
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:45,265
So with everything organized with
a checklist and a well defined

65
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:48,775
process, you can move on to the
next step of the playbook, right?

66
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,185
So you have the incident sponsor.

67
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:54,774
Number one priority as you can understand
is to identify the severity so we can

68
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:59,364
communicate internally to teams like
support or customer success and eventually

69
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:03,005
to our customers the impact of the
incident, what has been, what is broken.

70
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:07,545
So AI can process multiple data
and this is where actually AI and

71
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:12,049
Mattermost Copilot can help us as part
of our incident management process.

72
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,489
In this example, you can see that
the compile analyzed different kinds

73
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:22,469
of data we provided, like graphs,
data from our observability tool,

74
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:27,640
specifically the dashboards, screenshots,
and classified this incident as

75
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,879
a severity 2, due to the severe
performance issues with the database.

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,900
And it also provided detailed summary
identifying the nature of the problem.

77
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,180
this triage process allows
us to communicate clearly

78
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,480
with our internal team.

79
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,850
And that's why I didn't find the severity.

80
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,750
We can use the same context right now.

81
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,010
We are ready to communicate clearly
what's happening with our internal teams.

82
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,140
Instead of manually crafting these
updates, AI can generate them quickly.

83
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,560
So as we use modern most
playbook features, right?

84
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,240
And we have the generated summary,
we can just with a few clicks, set a

85
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,289
status update internally in a channel
and we ensure everyone is aligned

86
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,150
from engineer to customer success.

87
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,380
So with communication taken
care of, it's time to dive

88
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,940
deeper into the investigation.

89
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,490
And it's just as important to keep
our customers in the loop, right?

90
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,040
So with AI, we can quickly
generate customer facing updates.

91
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,240
And as you can see also in the video, you
can even use our templates we want to have

92
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,090
with our customers and AI can utilize them
to generate specific, clear status updates

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,730
based on the template we want to have.

94
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,490
In the past, writing both in external
updates would take a lot of time.

95
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,340
leaving room for errors,
and now AI handles this.

96
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,280
So giving us time to focus More on solving
the issue versus just managing the problem

97
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:50,050
and with communication taking care of it's
time to dive deeper into the investigation

98
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,169
and everything said, everyone is informed.

99
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:55,530
Everyone knows exactly what's happening.

100
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,140
And right now we need to
gather more information, right?

101
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,150
So we're starting more in our
observability tools, right?

102
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:01,405
Logs.

103
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:04,615
We get more information by our
support team, more information

104
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:05,565
by customer success team.

105
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,485
Something doesn't work.

106
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:10,485
And AI, in providing all this
information, you can see here we

107
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,755
provide logs and some information
by the support and customer success.

108
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,530
can do a contextual analysis.

109
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,120
So with extra input, AI right now can
pull more information, combines with the

110
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,520
previous context we already gathered, and
help us clarify more what's happening.

111
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:29,059
by bringing logs, tickets, and
input from the team members.

112
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,519
AI with this actually, can
empower us to highlight patterns

113
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:35,239
or issues we might miss.

114
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,189
During the initial response, right?

115
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:38,659
Because we are on rush.

116
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,049
We were under stress,
we were sleepy, right?

117
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:43,809
We just woke up from our REM sleep.

118
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:46,139
this makes the investigation
process a bit faster.

119
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,809
And a bit more efficient, right?

120
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:50,439
Because AI is constantly adding
more pieces to the puzzle.

121
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,979
And helping us see the full picture.

122
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:56,909
now that, let's assume that
the issue has been resolved.

123
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,320
What comes next?

124
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,930
Right now, we need to
generate, a post mortem.

125
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,930
We need to have details
about what happened.

126
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,010
What was the evidence?

127
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,330
What was the events, right?

128
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,720
What were the next action items
based on the whole thread we have?

129
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,649
in this case, we just have a simple
case where we're just going through.

130
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,600
But imagine multiple people talking,
multiple people were discussing, so you

131
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,260
can summarize all these things in one
generated timeline with events, evidence,

132
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,550
and how the issue has been resolved.

133
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:27,275
And this was a super manual process
in the beginning as a starting point.

134
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:30,904
And you have right now just a
quick summary, which we can just

135
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:34,044
start editing and unlock with
a collaboration with a team.

136
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:38,575
And this saves hours of manual work and
ensures that we learn from the incident

137
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:40,685
and prevent it from happening again.

138
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:42,865
Of course, AI isn't perfect, right?

139
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:46,785
As we discussed, collaboration between
the different kinds of people in human

140
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:48,695
context and input is important here.

141
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:50,265
Otherwise, the post mortem is just.

142
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,290
A summary which has been generated by
AI, but in practice, there are a lot

143
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,740
of much more things which happened.

144
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,640
It's just a good starting point to start
using it and collaborating as a team.

145
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:02,170
So AI isn't perfect.

146
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,370
And it's clear, we know that, right?

147
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,150
So AI can make mistakes.

148
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,540
So this is not an artificial
SRE or someone who is going to

149
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,720
do all the work for you, right?

150
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:19,825
What AI can give to us and empower us
actually more is automate some repetitive

151
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:22,895
tasks during stressful incidents.

152
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:26,315
We discussed being on call is very
stressful because of all the things,

153
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:29,795
there's multitasking, multiple updates,
multiple things to, to be done.

154
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:32,815
And you will be lucky if you have a
model where you have different kinds

155
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:35,605
of roles, like an incident commander,
someone who has a communication.

156
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:37,595
most of times there's no such a thing.

157
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:43,885
So AI can give us a very good solid
base and a starting point to automate

158
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:48,465
some of the repetitive tasks, which
can drag us out from the resolving the

159
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:51,965
incident and responding to the incident
versus just managing the incident.

160
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:58,055
So this, it's up to us to engineers
to refine each suggestions and

161
00:08:58,055 --> 00:08:59,635
make the final decisions, right?

162
00:08:59,635 --> 00:09:01,835
AI can give us key insights for us.

163
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,605
So you focus on fixing the problems.

164
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:09,155
And over time, AI improves, like we see
all these breakthroughs and innovation

165
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,285
which is happening in the space.

166
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:14,215
So becoming a more valuable
tool for speeding up incident

167
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:16,405
management, AI can help us.

168
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:19,575
And let's see that key
takeaways, from the today's talk.

169
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:26,405
AI helps us understand the problems faster
by giving you key insights right away.

170
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:30,375
So you can get, you can combine
different kinds of data and get a

171
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,615
summary of it in the end and understand
what's going on and put more context.

172
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:39,275
So AI can reduce some kind of the
multitasking which is happening because

173
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:43,525
you needed before to write all the
internal updates by yourself and you

174
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,265
were lucky if you had a template.

175
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:47,965
All the external updates by
yourself and you were lucky you

176
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:50,965
had another template there and you
need another tool there, right?

177
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:54,565
There was a lot of multitasking,
which has been significantly decreased

178
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:56,345
right now with the use of AI.

179
00:09:56,905 --> 00:10:01,440
And you just spent less time managing,
like sharing updates, discussing with

180
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,775
teams, sharing with the customer updates
to the customer, analyzing some of the

181
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,395
data or put more input to the context.

182
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:13,265
So you spent less time managing the
incident and more fixing it in the end.

183
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:17,385
And you have also the post mortems,
which can be helpful in the end for you

184
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:19,495
and your team to go to the next step.

185
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:21,995
actions and improve your reliability.

186
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:23,505
Thanks, everyone.

187
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:29,185
I hope this session gave you enough
insights into how AI can support SRE and

188
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:31,685
empower them, during incident management.

189
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:35,565
And if you are interested in
diving deeper, about the details

190
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:38,345
