00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,810
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,640
I'm Sai Deepak.

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,600
I'm a staff software engineer at Google.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,665
I lead the Maps quality team, where we
deal with a wide range of challenges

5
00:00:22,915 --> 00:00:26,534
related to auction algorithms modeling
advertiser conversion quality,

6
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:27,975
and the overall quality of ads.

7
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:31,895
I did my bachelor's at Indian
Initiative of Technology and after

8
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:33,845
graduation I started working at Google.

9
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:37,545
I initially worked on the business
software and then for a year and a half.

10
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:41,185
And then from then onwards, I have
started I've worked on the map sets.

11
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:44,885
Today I'm excited to talk to
you about leveraging artificial

12
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:49,395
intelligence for medical cost,
transparency, and consumer empowerment.

13
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:54,414
I think this is a topic I'm deeply
passionate about, as I believe

14
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:57,395
technology can play a transformative
role in making healthcare more

15
00:00:57,405 --> 00:00:58,794
affordable and accessible to everyone.

16
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:04,530
And I'm pretty sure everyone in
their life, Had to go to a doctor,

17
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,550
had had a medical emergency, had
to had to look up costs for either

18
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,820
a procedure or or a medication.

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,090
And this is actually a pretty big issue
in United States and even in other other

20
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,480
parts of the world, where people can
get pretty big surprises on the cost.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,910
In this in this in this in this
article we have explored like how we

22
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,710
can use artificial intelligence and
how we can try to resolve this resolve

23
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,650
the issue of consumer awareness.

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,320
Yeah, let's face it.

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,160
The U.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,330
S.

27
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,130
healthcare system is extremely
complex and often opaque.

28
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:43,725
It's it's whole working is not even
understood like by the doctors and

29
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:47,185
certainly not by the patients or
medical care providers or anyone.

30
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:52,575
The patients frequently find themselves
in the dark when it comes to when it

31
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:55,945
comes to understanding medical procedures
and the cost of medical procedures.

32
00:01:56,535 --> 00:02:00,735
This lack of transparency often leads
to a significant financial strain

33
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:05,195
for millions of Americans, but also
results in delayed or avoided care.

34
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:10,475
And it, it the the delayed or avoided
care can lead to making the issue even

35
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:12,255
worse and driving up the long term costs.

36
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:17,265
For example, one of my friends had when
he was studying, like one of my friends

37
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:21,985
had an injury in his leg, but because
he was he, because he did not have a

38
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:26,265
good medical insurance at this time,
at the time he delayed the care till

39
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:30,975
till he graduated and until he was able
to get a job, but that delayed led to

40
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:33,345
exacerbation of the injury to his leg.

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,860
And ultimately ultimately long term long
term issues and the long term costs.

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,400
As a professional deeply involved in
the intersection of the technology

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,940
and healthcare, I'm hoping to
use cutting edge innovations to

44
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,870
solve these critical challenges.

45
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:54,145
Today I'm excited to announce like a AI
driven platform that has a potential to

46
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:59,215
revolutionize the healthcare affordability
and transparency by empowering customers

47
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:02,035
with much more accurate and much
more personalized cost information.

48
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:06,655
This platform uses the the newest AI
techniques such as like artificial

49
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:09,970
intelligence, ability to process
like large amount of textual data.

50
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,010
And integrating them with analytics
and it it changes how patient interacts

51
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,780
with the healthcare system and it
can improve the quality of the the

52
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,850
care and make the information more
accessible and affordable for all.

53
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,000
There are various problems in
the problems in the healthcare

54
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,600
health healthcare transparency.

55
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,980
One is the high and another is
the unpredictability of the cost.

56
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Basically the pricing is very opaque.

57
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,720
Sometimes the insurance
covers it, sometimes it don't.

58
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,650
Like sometimes one one
provider charges one one price.

59
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,490
Sometimes another provider
charges another price.

60
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,360
Sometimes the prices can change
with zip code and the cities

61
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,940
leading to unexpectedly very high
medical bills, lack of transparency.

62
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,980
Consumers don't have a clear
way or dashboard or a software.

63
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,890
To understand like the clear and
accurate cost for the medical procedures.

64
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,510
This leads to a significant number
of financial stress and poor decision

65
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,030
making in the absence of like complete
accurate picture to the users.

66
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:08,165
Financial strain the burden of the medical
costs like often leads to delaying or

67
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:10,155
completely avoiding the care together.

68
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:14,245
And we have various studies which
shows that for example, like having

69
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:18,005
regular care or the or the yearly
checkups like can actually reduce

70
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:19,845
like the the much the long term costs.

71
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:23,635
Much more significantly inefficiencies.

72
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:27,735
The inefficiencies in the market
contributes to like inflated prices and

73
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:31,745
reduce competition among providers One
of the biggest cause for this is just

74
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:35,794
the lack of transparency in this area
where where very few people have access

75
00:04:35,794 --> 00:04:41,204
to the prices unlike in other systems,
for example If you want to buy clothes or

76
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:44,624
if you want to buy buy any electronics,
you can just simply go to amazon.

77
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:45,424
com or google.

78
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:48,794
com or any other, like any
other aggregator websites.

79
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:52,304
And you can simply look up like the
properties of all the electronics goods.

80
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:53,224
What is the price?

81
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:55,664
What is how much does it
take to deliver everything?

82
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:59,124
Everything is everything is pretty
pretty well exposed to the users.

83
00:04:59,444 --> 00:05:02,574
So they can take all this information
and make the decision for themselves.

84
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:05,614
However, in healthcare, like
everything's very opaque.

85
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:09,299
All this information is hidden
away and known to very few people.

86
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:11,729
Comparison difficulties.

87
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:15,469
Obviously this lack of transparency
makes it very challenging to compare

88
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:18,339
the costs and the quality across
different healthcare providers,

89
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:21,559
limiting their ability to make
an informed, educated choice.

90
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,279
Solution.

91
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,639
Our AI driven platform has
three has has three pillars.

92
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:28,659
One is the AI power transparency.

93
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:32,969
So our platform uses newest LLMs and
machine learning to deliver accurate

94
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:35,549
personalized medical cost estimates.

95
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:41,264
We have integrated data from
multiple sources, including hospital

96
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:44,794
charge masters, insurance claims,
and user reported costs to create

97
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,304
a comprehensive pricing database.

98
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:50,284
This way we have used LLMs to
basically like ingest the data

99
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:54,044
and pass the data and Or put the
data in a much more formatted way.

100
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:59,225
And we use this we can then use this
use this data and run analytics and give

101
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:00,595
personalized information to the user.

102
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,055
Real time estimates.

103
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:06,005
The system provides like real time, like
personalized cost estimates within seconds

104
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,875
using all the data that we have extracted.

105
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:12,355
And it is tailored to individual specific
situation, individual's area, and

106
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:13,865
the insurance the coverage they have.

107
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:15,965
How it works.

108
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:21,045
We have an A Web powered
cost estimation process.

109
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:24,835
So first we collected the data
from various aggregators, either

110
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,715
hospitals or the insurance
claims, or the user reported.

111
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:33,475
A user can also themselves
report cost of the cost, and

112
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:35,515
using all these various sources,

113
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:40,105
pretty robust pricing database.

114
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:43,795
And then we with respect to the machine
learning algorithms, we have like advanced

115
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:47,425
machine learning algorithms where it takes
all this data and we train models on it,

116
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:51,035
with various features such as regional
variations, like provider specific

117
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:55,665
pricing, user specific insurance coverage,
and various various other other signals

118
00:06:55,665 --> 00:07:00,065
to train a model to to understand like the
the, to understand the landscape of the

119
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:04,025
pricing real time estimation and based on
the model we have trained, we can provide

120
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:09,205
like a cost estimate for for the user with
based on based on their own issues, their

121
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:14,775
own geographic area, their own insurance
provider and validation the real time

122
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:18,055
data validation techniques ensures that
the estimates are correct and accurate.

123
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:18,175
Okay.

124
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,890
And the user can themselves give feedback
to us and help us in iterating and

125
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,950
improving the the data output we provide.

126
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,190
Some of the key features of the platform
are the personalized cost estimation.

127
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,270
Giving the personalized cost estimation
with with a variance of plus or

128
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,480
minus 50 percent for the common
procedures and plus or minus 30

129
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,620
percent for the complex procedures.

130
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,540
This allows the user to plan for their
healthcare expenses more effectively.

131
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,990
Even though this this pan might seem
pretty big, this is actually much,

132
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,949
much better than the current blind
the current the current Peace out.

133
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:50,719
The current complete
lack of data that exists.

134
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:54,419
This at least like users this at least
gives an estimate to the to the users.

135
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:56,899
And the huge thing is provider comparison.

136
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:00,205
It enables users to compare like
prices and the, the quality ratings

137
00:08:00,215 --> 00:08:01,925
across multiple healthcare providers.

138
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:07,915
This significantly increases the
competition among them and obviously

139
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:12,905
like people can take the prices and the
quality in order to make that decision to

140
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,445
whether to go to the healthcare providers.

141
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,280
AI provides negotiation support.

142
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,960
It uses assist users in negotiating lower
bills creating creating letters, attaching

143
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,160
information, attaching the billing data,
attaching the comparison data, and the

144
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,910
users can leverage to to identify the
areas where the cost can be reduced.

145
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,120
On average some users saw 18 percent,
more than 18 percent reduction in

146
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,230
their medical bills by using these
the generated support information.

147
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:42,135
And we have to we obviously want to
make sure that there is a fairness and

148
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:43,705
transparency in the cost estimation.

149
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:46,695
We have a significant number of
mechanisms in place to mitigate bias

150
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:50,496
and ensures that all the reasons all
the users receive equitable treatment

151
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:53,966
and we don't use any signals which can
distinguish between for example way

152
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:56,226
where we distinguish between two users.

153
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:59,576
This in this slide, we shared
the impact and results from the

154
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:00,956
impact and results from this.

155
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:04,526
And we have seen significant cost
reduction for the users who have

156
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:06,096
used the negotiation support feature.

157
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:10,431
They saw 18 percent reduction
in the medical bills and

158
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:14,301
significantly decrease low out of
lower out of market expectancies.

159
00:09:14,651 --> 00:09:16,591
You also see an increase
in improved access to care.

160
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:20,411
Now that like users have like an
estimation of like how much How much

161
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:25,381
it will actually cause, they can do a
better budgeting of the finances and

162
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:29,621
and actually and actually use, and
actually try to get the cost sorry try

163
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:32,181
to get get the care and budget for it.

164
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:36,591
And users are now more confident in their
ability to afford the necessary treatment.

165
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:39,941
20 percent reduction in the
avoided or delayed care.

166
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:44,321
This this this also obviously led
to like more better health outcomes.

167
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:48,591
Reducing these financial barriers people's
health outcomes have improved, they're

168
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:50,661
able to save more costs in the longterm.

169
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:53,571
They're able to have a more healthier,
happier, and healthier life.

170
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:58,596
And we hope that this will have a
significant impact in the market.

171
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:02,576
This has the potential to disrupt the
healthcare by increasing the competition

172
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:06,466
among the providers, driving down the
overall healthcare costs improving the

173
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:10,226
transparency in this area, reducing the
anxiety that is faced by everyday people.

174
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:15,946
There are significant challenges while
we were doing the implementation of this.

175
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:18,696
One, I don't think this would
have been possible without the

176
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:21,926
breakthrough technologies that have
come in the last two and three years.

177
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:25,976
For example, the context for
example, analyzing the textual data.

178
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:32,545
And generating more structured output from
the textual data would have an extremely

179
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:37,396
hard without the use of without how good
the large language models are now, which

180
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:41,106
can pass through hundreds of pages of
the document and output the structured

181
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:42,816
data that we are accurately asking for.

182
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:48,276
With respect to the data and the privacy
we use advanced encryption techniques and

183
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:50,716
secure computation to product user data.

184
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,011
Differential privacy measures ensure
that individual data points cannot

185
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:55,811
be traced to the specific users.

186
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:58,171
In fact, we don't even
keep any individual data.

187
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:01,101
as soon as we train the
data is just thrown away.

188
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:04,451
With respect to the data accuracy,
we use a federated learning.

189
00:11:04,451 --> 00:11:07,941
It allows the platform to
continuously improve this algorithm

190
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:11,841
without compromising users privacy
by mainly not taking any user

191
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:13,251
use of personalization signals.

192
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:16,916
And the real time data validation
ensures that the estimates are

193
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:19,606
based on the more current and more
accurate information available.

194
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:24,086
So to do this, like our models train
trains continuously on on the latest

195
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,076
data on the latest data points.

196
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,875
And we give we we force the model
to give like lower and lower, lower

197
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:31,406
weightages to the to the older data.

198
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,126
So that like for example,
the prices are based on like

199
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,081
the 2023 and 20, for example.

200
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:39,976
The cost estimates for 2024 are
based on 2023 and 2024 data,

201
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:42,316
not based on the two 2016 data.

202
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:47,376
The model like automatically uses the
old data for generalization, but it

203
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:51,036
uses the more new data for giving more
accurate data points to the users.

204
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,506
I think ethical AI, we have a
robust ethical AI framework in

205
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:57,216
place to ensure the fairness and
transparency in cost estimation.

206
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:01,236
We don't take any we don't take any
users identifying input features or try

207
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:02,696
to differentiate between two people.

208
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:06,206
The platform actively works to
mitigate the bias and ensure

209
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:07,946
equitable treatment for the all users.

210
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:12,051
This, we mainly do this by not
having any users any user personal

211
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:16,111
IIS identifiers and treating like
two people with the same with the

212
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,925
same condition and in the same way.

213
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:18,156
Okay.

214
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:22,126
Here I want to go a bit into
the future and enhancements.

215
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:25,306
So we wanted we wanted we
have a few other ideas for the

216
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:26,536
future that we would like to do.

217
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:29,226
We want to integrate with the
electronic health records.

218
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:31,886
This way we can provide like
a more comprehensive view

219
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:33,146
of the patient outcomes.

220
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:37,421
And the patient costs, it allows for the
personalized long term financial planning.

221
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:40,951
This data can be integrated into
the other the financial tools.

222
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:45,151
And this can this can let people, for
example, plan their retirement, plan the

223
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:49,211
costs that will plan the general costs
that they will have in the long term.

224
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:53,331
And and also more help them in
the saving for the long term

225
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,411
for the health health costs.

226
00:12:57,056 --> 00:12:58,916
We want to have predictive
health spending models.

227
00:12:58,956 --> 00:13:02,396
This this platform will develop
predictive models to help users anticipate

228
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:05,766
future health care costs based on
the medical industry and lifestyle.

229
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:09,626
This will lead to enabling better
budgeting and the financial planning.

230
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,486
For example, let's say
someone has diabetes.

231
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:17,276
This this model can use that information
to know for example, what is the

232
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,496
cost on average they will be using
they will be seeing one year from

233
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:23,726
now, five years from now, 10 years
from now, and during the retirement.

234
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:27,746
What kind of what is the rough estimate
of the medical cost they they might see?

235
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:31,956
What, how much is the, how much is how
much money they should save right now?

236
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:36,266
And it may, it can even help give
suggestions to to reduce and reduce

237
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:37,546
the amount of money that is needed.

238
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:42,246
Feature expansion currently the
ongoing development is focusing

239
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,896
on expanding platform capabilities
to cover more complex processes

240
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:48,926
and broader datasets, ensuring it
remains relevant and useful across a

241
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:50,466
wide range of healthcare scenarios.

242
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:54,566
With respect to the market opportunity,
we see a significant the potential

243
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:55,636
in the market and the growth.

244
00:13:56,026 --> 00:14:00,116
Obviously, this is like a, this is like
a multi trillion dollar multi trillion

245
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:05,696
dollar area where even if we can make like
a 1 percent dent, we'll be very happy.

246
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:09,416
And that'll be a significant impact
on both in terms of the costs saved in

247
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,926
terms of the anxiety saved by the by
the users and overall improvement in

248
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,966
the health and happiness of the users.

249
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:20,436
There is significant growing demand as
the healthcare cost continue to rise

250
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:24,146
above inflation, there is significant
demand for tools that can provide

251
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:28,076
like cost, transparency and help and
consumers to make informed decisions.

252
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:31,286
This data will help everyone
like this, will help consumers

253
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,276
as will help businesses.

254
00:14:32,276 --> 00:14:35,546
This will help everyone to make
a more informed decision markets.

255
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:37,676
As the market for AI driven
healthcare solutions is

256
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,176
projected to grow significantly.

257
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:42,851
Especially with the new technologies such
as large language models, which which

258
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:46,591
can which can understand like the medical
information much better, which can which

259
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:50,481
can transcribe the medical information and
generate like more actionable information.

260
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:54,966
So there are substantial opportunities
for these platforms to focus on the cost

261
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:57,366
transparency and consumer empowerment.

262
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:01,006
Consumer competitive landscape
we are acknowledging that our

263
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:02,696
platform, it's it's not unique.

264
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:07,596
It stands out in the crowded market due to
its unique combination of the personalized

265
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:10,666
cost estimate, provided compassion
and AI powered negotiation support.

266
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:14,656
However, we do want to do well and
give better service to the users so

267
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:16,676
that this can help them in their life.

268
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:21,236
With respect to the partnership, we
would like to have forged a strategic

269
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:25,826
partnership with healthcare providers,
insurers, technology companies, and also

270
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:28,846
to create new streams and expanded reach.

271
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:33,056
To conclude the cost of
healthcare has has has risen

272
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:34,736
significantly like about inflation.

273
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:39,356
And this is one of the significant
significant financial financial

274
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,276
issue that people people face with.

275
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:45,431
And this is one of the significant
things that people fail to account for

276
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:47,231
account for their in, in their life.

277
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:51,701
And this leads to a significant number of
anxiety significant number of significant

278
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:55,621
amount of impact in their life in the,
during financial and budgeting and so on.

279
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,831
There is a significant need for
the transparency and consumer

280
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:03,021
empowerment because this this
area is extremely opaque.

281
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:08,556
Extremely unknown and extremely complex
and bureaucratic, unlike many of the

282
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:12,446
sectors, for example, like financial
sector consumer and electronic sector

283
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:16,176
services sector, where there's a
significant number of you can just go and

284
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:17,896
look up online to get all the information.

285
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:21,776
This is extremely extremely
opaque and this is screaming for

286
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:23,476
more transparency and openness.

287
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:27,146
The AI driven platform addresses
these pressing issues by

288
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:31,526
providing users with the accurate
personalized medical cost estimate.

289
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:36,166
And it helps them to make informed
decisions about their health care.

290
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:41,096
And our project also would not have been
possible without the The large language

291
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:44,666
models that have come in the last two
and, two and a half to three years.

292
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:48,256
Because most of the, most of our
work involves transcribing like

293
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:49,786
large amount of textual information.

294
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:53,186
With which, which also includes the
cost of specific procedures, the

295
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,766
cost of pharmaceuticals, and so on.

296
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:58,176
This would not have been possible
to do with with the previous with

297
00:16:58,176 --> 00:16:59,736
the previous textual understanding.

298
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:04,476
But with the new LLMs, such as with the
new the new, with the new advanced LLMs

299
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:06,166
this becomes much, much more easier.

300
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:09,576
We also integrate the data
from the diverse sources,

301
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:12,446
including charge hospital,
charge masters, insurance claims.

302
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:16,646
And also we also let the users
themselves report the cost and our

303
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,676
platform creates like a comprehensive
pricing database, which offers real time

304
00:17:20,676 --> 00:17:22,546
insights into all these medical expenses.

305
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:28,026
This level of transparency is designed
to elevate the financial stress that so

306
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:31,476
many Americans face when navigating the
complexity of the healthcare system.

307
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:36,816
We hope that with this project we make
we make impact and let let consumers

308
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:40,606
understand the cost of the healthcare cost
of the procedures, cost of the general

309
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:41,981
cost that they are paying and make.

310
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,156
more informed decisions in their life.

311
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:47,656
Feel free to let me feel free to
contact me if you have any further

312
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:49,966
questions and thank you for your time.
