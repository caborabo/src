00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,220
Hi, I'm Ravi Kamampati.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,640
Welcome to this talk on Mastering Network
Resilience and Scalability through

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,450
Routing and Switching Fundamentals.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,750
In today's session, we will cover the
fundamentals of routing and switching, key

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,900
technologies, advanced concepts, and how
these concepts are applied in industries.

6
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:20,720
By the end of this session, you will
have a clear understanding of how

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,709
routing and switching work together
to build a resilient network capable

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,870
of scaling to meet modern needs.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,160
Now let's look at the, agenda, the
table of contents that I would like

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,350
to discuss on today's, conference.

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,380
first we would like to discuss about the
introduction to routing and switching.

12
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:40,410
The second goal is the layer two
switching and its fundamentals.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,240
and the third one goes, some of the key
technologies that are used in switching.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,850
The fourth goes the routing
fundamentals and core protocols.

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,559
the fifth goes the comparison of
routing, protocols and list of

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,060
different types of protocols that are
used in, widely across the industry.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,060
And then, goes the synergy between the
routing and switching, the next goes the

18
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,080
advanced network design concepts that we
would like to discuss on, the last but not

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,909
the least is the industry applications,
to see where all of these protocols

20
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,809
and switching are being widely used.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,300
And at the end, we would like to conclude,
based on the opinion that I have that

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,580
I would like to share with you guys.

23
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:26,205
All right, so let's begin with
discussing about some introduction

24
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:27,535
about routing and switching.

25
00:01:28,195 --> 00:01:32,535
So in this slide, basically I
would like to introduce two core

26
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:34,714
concepts of routing and switching.

27
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:39,345
switching operates basically at layer
two of the OSA model, which basically

28
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:43,695
handles traffic within the local
area network by using a MAC address.

29
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:48,365
This basically ensures the data
is transmitted efficiently between

30
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:51,555
devices within the same network.

31
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:55,615
On the other hand, the routing operates
at layer three and connects different

32
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,774
networks by using an IP addresses.

33
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:03,372
This enables data transmission between
separate networks or across vast areas.

34
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:07,482
Together, routing and switching form
the foundation of, modern networks.

35
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:11,412
Understanding these concepts is
really crucial for incident management

36
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,772
where quick troubleshooting and
scalability are often required.

37
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:18,602
Now let's look into, some
of the layer 2 switching

38
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:20,922
fundamentals, to discuss in detail.

39
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:24,962
let's, dive a little bit
deeper into layer 2 switching.

40
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:29,752
where, which is essential for local
area networks, switching basically

41
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:33,502
learns the MAC addresses, learns
and uses the MAC addresses to

42
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:38,022
direct traffic, ensuring efficient
communication between the same network.

43
00:02:38,412 --> 00:02:42,332
we'll also discuss VLANs, which
allows network segmentation, instead

44
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:46,282
of treating all devices in, as one
large group, VLANs basically break

45
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:51,852
down into smaller grou logical groups,
improving the performance and security.

46
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:53,677
next we talk about the trunking.

47
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:56,997
Trunking allows the traffic
from multiple VLANs to travel

48
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:58,497
over a single network link.

49
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:03,832
This is significant, this is significant
because it increases the efficiency and

50
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:08,682
also boosts, the network capability,
especially in large area networks.

51
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:12,992
Finally, we would like to, discuss about
the spanning tree protocol, which is

52
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:17,912
one of the important protocols, which is
also called as STP, basically prevents

53
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:23,402
network loops in redundant technologies,
ensuring the network, doesn't experience

54
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:26,482
any downtime due to repeated data flows.

55
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:28,632
All right.

56
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:31,792
So now let's look at some of
the key technologies that are

57
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,552
used in, switching technologies.

58
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:37,572
here we explore some of the key
technologies that are used in switching.

59
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:40,577
the one important thing is, as
we discussed before, the VLAN is

60
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:45,067
nothing but virtual area network, as
mentioned earlier, are critical, are

61
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:47,297
basically for network segmentation.

62
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:51,397
They help reduce broadcast storms,
keeping network traffic localized.

63
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:55,577
By grouping devices into VLANs,
administrator can basically manage

64
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:59,727
network traffic more efficiently and
reduce unnecessary data broadcast.

65
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:01,982
Trunking is the next key technology.

66
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:06,402
Trunking basically eliminates the need
for additional cabling by allowing VLANs

67
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:09,362
to use a single physical connection.

68
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:12,342
This makes your network more
efficient, especially when

69
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,922
managing a number of VLANs.

70
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:18,242
Each of these technologies basically
play a vital role in making the network

71
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,272
more scalable, efficient, and secure.

72
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:24,452
Now in this slide, let's
talk, more about routing.

73
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:27,222
until now we were discussing
about row switching.

74
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:31,152
And now let's switch our gears towards
routing and understand its core protocols

75
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:35,752
and its efficiency and need for, for
its need, need to use these protocols.

76
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,567
Routing unlike switching operates
at layer 3 and it is concerned with,

77
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:44,067
direct data across different networks.

78
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,927
So there are several key routing
protocols which are used for

79
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:50,697
serving, different purposes.

80
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:54,087
let's talk about OSPF,
which is the first protocol.

81
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:57,262
before we get into it, I would like
to list the different protocols.

82
00:04:57,262 --> 00:05:00,252
I would like to give an
high, high level overview.

83
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:03,252
OSPF, Open Status Path First.

84
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:07,052
The next one is EIGRP, which is
Enhanced Interior Gateway Protocol.

85
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:10,322
The third one is BGP, which
is a Border Gateway Protocol.

86
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:14,892
The fourth one is nothing but MPLS,
which is Multi Protocol Label Switching.

87
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:20,152
In OSPF, is a widely used link
state protocol, basically suitable

88
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:21,952
for large, complex networks.

89
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:24,152
It offers quick convergence
and high scalability.

90
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:28,322
In EHRP is a Cisco proprietary protocol
known for its speed and efficiency.

91
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:32,252
BGP is a backbone of the internet.

92
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:34,622
It manages routing between
autonomous systems.

93
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:40,062
Allowing data to travel from one, one
network to other network across the globe.

94
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,982
in MPLS, it's a multi
protocol label switching.

95
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:47,852
It isn't a routing protocol per se, but
a technique which is used by the service

96
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:50,372
providers to optimize network traffic.

97
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:54,402
So these protocols are the heart
of network routing, enabling

98
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:58,482
data to travel quickly, securely,
and efficiently across networks.

99
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:05,322
So now let's do some comparison between
the protocols that we just discussed now.

100
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:11,907
in OSPF, OSPF is basically ideal for
large enterprise networks and service

101
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:16,267
providers where it's for fast convergence
and scalability making it's a top choice.

102
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,697
In EIGRP, as I mentioned, it is designed
for Cisco networks offering quick

103
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:23,447
convergence and efficient bandwidth usage.

104
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:26,677
It's highly efficient in terms
of computational resources.

105
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:31,622
BGP powers the internet allowing for
the policy based routing and managing

106
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:33,952
connections across different networks.

107
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:38,172
It's highly scalable, but
requires careful configuration.

108
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:42,162
MPLS is used in service
provider networks to optimize

109
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,992
traffic and offer VPN services.

110
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:47,312
Understanding the strengths and
weaknesses of each protocol helps

111
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:51,222
network professionals choose the
right one for its infrastructure.

112
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:52,582
All right.

113
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,612
So let's talk about the synergy
between the routing and switching.

114
00:06:56,982 --> 00:07:01,082
Routing and switching, are
basically, aren't basically, two

115
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:02,242
different separate processes.

116
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:07,322
They basically work in tandem to ensure,
smooth data transmission across networks.

117
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:10,602
While switching handles traffic
with the local area, routing,

118
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:12,242
connects different networks.

119
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:15,762
Together, they are, they allow
seamless communication between,

120
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:19,092
within and between LAN and WAN, WANs.

121
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:24,592
this synergy, is as crucial for,
modern networking, whether you are

122
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:28,142
working in a corporate environment or
managing a large scale data center.

123
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:31,832
The combined power of routing and
switching is what keeps everything

124
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:33,992
running smoothly and efficiently.

125
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:35,332
All right.

126
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:39,662
let's, discuss in detail about some of
the advanced network design concepts.

127
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:46,057
let's list out all the advanced concepts
that I would like to, discuss in detail.

128
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,207
the first one being, the route
distribution, the next one

129
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:52,147
being the quality of service,
other one being the IPSec.

130
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:55,727
so basically by integrating this advanced
technology, we can design network that

131
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,907
are more resilient, efficient and secure.

132
00:07:58,397 --> 00:07:59,727
So what is route distribution?

133
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:04,477
Route distribution basically allows
different protocols to share information,

134
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:06,417
ensuring seamless connectivity.

135
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:16,167
Next, one being quality
of service, enables the

136
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,807
prioritization of network traffic.

137
00:08:18,107 --> 00:08:21,147
Crucial services like voice
and video can be given a higher

138
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:23,167
priority or less important traffic.

139
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:26,682
Ensuring smooth operations
for essential services.

140
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:32,052
The next one being IPSec, the
IPSec basically adds another layer

141
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:36,902
of security by encrypting data at
the network layer, especially used

142
00:08:36,902 --> 00:08:38,832
for virtual, private networks.

143
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:43,682
By integrating these advanced concepts,
we can design networks that are more

144
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:46,252
resilient, efficient and secure.

145
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:50,842
So now let's look at the, this
slide on industry applications.

146
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:54,402
We would like to discuss how these
are used in real world scenarios.

147
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:59,922
in enterprise networks, routing
and switching basically play,

148
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:04,782
enable low latency, seamless
business operations, whether it's

149
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,122
finance, retail, or manufacturing.

150
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:10,672
In telecommunications, advanced routing
and switching technologies power

151
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:14,652
5G networks, ensuring high speed,
reliable, and seamless connection.

152
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:18,972
in cloud computing basically relies
on seamless connectivity between on

153
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:23,222
premise cloud services and this is where
routing and switching become very crucial

154
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:26,852
for hybrid cloud models and SD WANs.

155
00:09:26,852 --> 00:09:30,492
For IoT and edge computing, or allow
efficient management of connected

156
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:34,912
devices, reducing latency and ensuring
fast data transmission at edge.

157
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:38,842
these examples show how vital
these technologies are driven in

158
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:40,412
modern digital transformation.

159
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:45,882
So to conclude, we had a detailed
discussion about different

160
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:50,092
topics that we were trying to
touch base on the agenda today.

161
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:54,442
To conclude, I would like to say
routing and switching basically act

162
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:56,182
as a backbone of modern networks.

163
00:09:56,222 --> 00:10:00,722
As we move into the future of
technologies like 5G, IoT, AI driven

164
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:03,662
networks, the role of routing and
switching will continue to expand.

165
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,802
future trends such as
software defined networking.

166
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:10,812
network function, virtual
function virtualization, NFW

167
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:13,312
