1
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,850
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,219
I'm Ravi Kamambatti.

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,330
I'm very excited here to talk
about designing resilient and

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,709
scalable network infrastructure
at the, for the digital age.

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,659
I'm an engineering manager at Realize
with strong focus in networking,

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,400
predominantly in the areas of routing,
switching, firewalls, telecommunication.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,170
Over the next 30 minutes, we will
cover on these following topics

8
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:40,720
related to layer two and layer
three networking technologies.

9
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:44,875
Then advanced networking concepts
like road distribution, quality

10
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,605
of service and security protocols.

11
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:51,225
Then how automation and AI are
shaping the future of networks.

12
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:56,935
And we'll end up with industry
applications, key for future trends.

13
00:00:57,315 --> 00:00:58,754
And my conclusion on it.

14
00:00:59,355 --> 00:01:02,914
So let's dive into the introduction.

15
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:07,374
As we all know, in today's world,
network infrastructure is the heart

16
00:01:07,374 --> 00:01:09,094
of every digital transformation.

17
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:13,854
It acts as the backbone for seamless
data communication, ensuring

18
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:18,084
businesses can operate efficiently
in this fast paced environment.

19
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:22,744
The goal of this presentation is take you
through critical components of the network

20
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:28,404
design with a focus on how we can make
networks, both resilient and scalable.

21
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:32,464
These two factors, resilience
and scalability are the crucial

22
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:36,654
because we need networks that not
only cover from these issues, but

23
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:39,004
also to grow with evolving needs.

24
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:49,024
Next let's talk about in detail with
regards to the switching technologies.

25
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:53,184
At layer two of the OSM model, we
have the switching technologies.

26
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:56,934
Layer two is basically
responsible for local transmission

27
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:58,064
within the network segment.

28
00:01:58,524 --> 00:02:02,834
And it plays a critical role in how data
is handled and moved across devices.

29
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:08,444
One key concept here is the VLANs
or the virtual local area networks.

30
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,999
VLANs allow us to virtually segment
a network, meaning we can group

31
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:17,039
devices together based on a logic
rather than their physical location.

32
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:21,579
Their segmentation enhances the
security by isolating sensitive data,

33
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:25,269
improves performance by reducing
unnecessary traffic over the network.

34
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,019
For example, in the enterprise
setting, you could group the

35
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:32,679
accounting department into one VLAN
and HR department into another.

36
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:37,104
Even though they may share the
same physical network, the VLAN

37
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,754
ensures that data is separated.

38
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:41,734
Now we talk about trunking.

39
00:02:41,774 --> 00:02:46,084
This is where we allow multiple VLANs
to share single physical network link.

40
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:48,654
By doing this, we optimize resources.

41
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,130
Simplify network architecture trunking
allows the VLAN to communicate

42
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:56,720
with each other efficiently while
maintaining the distant boundaries.

43
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:00,829
And finally, a spanning tree
protocol or STP is a critical

44
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,840
piece of layer 2 technology.

45
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:06,605
It prevents network loops where
which can be a major issue,

46
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:10,695
especially in large networks where
data could potentially circulate

47
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,135
endlessly clogging up the network.

48
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:18,505
STP or Spanning Tree Protocol ensures
that there is always a primary path for

49
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:23,385
data and a backup in case the main path
fails, adding much more needed redundancy.

50
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:28,325
Now let's talk about
the routing protocols.

51
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:31,525
Now let's shift the gear to layer three.

52
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,734
This is where routing comes into play.

53
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,720
While Layer 2 focuses on switching within
the network, Layer 3 enables communication

54
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,810
across multiple networks through routing.

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,839
One of the most well known
protocols here is OSPF.

56
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:47,815
Open shortest path first.

57
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:52,365
OSPIP is a dynamic routing protocol,
meaning it constantly updates itself to

58
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,635
find the best path for data transmission.

59
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:58,885
It's highly scalable, and it's highly
used in large enterprise networks.

60
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:00,575
Then we have the BGP.

61
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:04,624
The Border Gateway Protocol is
essential for managing how packets

62
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,065
are routed across the internet.

63
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:10,895
It allows the data to travel between
different autonomous systems or

64
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:15,025
networks, especially those controlled
by different organizations.

65
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:17,785
Think of BGP as a
backbone of the internet.

66
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:21,955
It ensures that data finds its
way across diverse networks.

67
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:27,505
Finally, we talk about MPLS multi
multi protocol label switching.

68
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:32,455
Streamline the routing process by enabling
label rather than long network addresses.

69
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:37,995
This improves speed as an efficiency,
especially in large networks

70
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:39,185
where there is a lot of traffic.

71
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:43,525
By understanding this layer 3
protocols, we can see how data moves

72
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:47,270
it between individual networks and
across the border broader internet.

73
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,000
Now let's talk about the synergy
between Layer 2 and Layer 3.

74
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,319
So how do Layer 2 work work together?

75
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:58,230
The answer lies in their synergy.

76
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,799
These two layers are not
stand alone technologies.

77
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,984
Rather, they complement each other.

78
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:06,515
with each other to create a seamless
and efficient network efficient network.

79
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:11,644
At layer two, we use a VLAN for
segmentation, creating isolated

80
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,455
segment sections within the network.

81
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:17,655
At layer three, we use routing protocols
like OSP of BGP to connect these

82
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:20,375
segments, route data between them.

83
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:24,355
This ensures that both isolation
and connectivity were key

84
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:26,565
components in modern network design.

85
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:28,735
Let me give you an example.

86
00:05:28,764 --> 00:05:32,820
In a corporate environment, you need
to You might use a VLAN to isolate

87
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,710
the marketing, finance, HR department.

88
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,249
However, we still need to communicate
with each other at certain points.

89
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,279
Layer 3 routing protocols allow
this for this communication while

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,800
maintaining the isolation of
each department sensitive data.

91
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,180
This integration between Layer 2 and Layer
3 reduces latency, maximizes throughput,

92
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,370
ensures that data moves efficiently across
the network without unnecessary delays.

93
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,325
This It's about achieving
the right balance between

94
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:03,015
segmentation and performance.

95
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:08,025
Now let's talk about the
advanced networking concepts.

96
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,945
Let's explore some advanced
networking concepts.

97
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:17,155
These technologies enhance networking
performance, security, and efficiency.

98
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:20,015
First, let's talk about
the route distribution.

99
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:24,395
In many large networks, multiple
routing protocols are used.

100
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:29,075
Route distribution enables these
protocols to coexist by sharing

101
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:30,615
route information across them.

102
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:35,135
This ensures cohesive network operation
even when different parts of the

103
00:06:35,135 --> 00:06:36,795
network uses different protocols.

104
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:42,175
Then we have quality of service or QoS
is basically crucial for prioritizing

105
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,845
certain types of traffic over other.

106
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:48,625
For instance, in a video conference,
you may need to make sure that video and

107
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,805
audio packets are given priority over.

108
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,880
Less critical traffic like background
background downloads by doing this

109
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,090
QoS maintains a performance standards
even when network is congested.

110
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,910
Finally, let's touch down on
security concepts like access

111
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,500
control lists or ACLs and IPSec.

112
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,760
ACLs control who and what kind of
certain parts of the network can

113
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,100
access certain part of the network.

114
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,940
For example, ACLs can be used to
ensure that only authorized personnel.

115
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,650
Can access sensitive financial data ipsec
on the other hand is a suite of protocols

116
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:30,420
Used to secure communication by encrypting
and authenticating each IP packet is

117
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,830
commonly used in vpn to secure remote
communications All of these advanced

118
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:42,410
networking tools play a role in optimizing
and securing modern networks Now let's

119
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:48,140
discuss a security in network design
security is a critical, in every aspect

120
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:54,470
of network design without robust measures
Even the most efficient network can

121
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,695
fall victim to breaches and disruptions.

122
00:07:58,465 --> 00:08:03,615
As I mentioned earlier, ACLS or access
control lists are used to define the

123
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:08,405
define which users and systems can
access specific parts of a network.

124
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:14,405
ACL access are filter based on criteria
like IP addresses or protocols.

125
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:18,965
Common use cases is is like
restricting access to a to a sensitive

126
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,520
data in a corporate environment.

127
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:26,065
For instance, in a financial institutions,
ACL might allow only the financial

128
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:30,285
team to access certain database while
keeping others their departments out.

129
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:36,415
Another key in for security feature is
IPSec or Internet Protocol Security.

130
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:41,345
IPSec ensures secure communication
by encrypting and authenticating IP

131
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:43,075
packets in a communication session.

132
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:46,715
This is particularly useful
in virtual private networks.

133
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,850
We are secure data sense
between remote workers and and

134
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,180
corporate network with IPSec.

135
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,650
You can ensure that the data remains
private and unaltered, and even if

136
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,460
intercepted by many malicious actors

137
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,520
in today's increasingly complex
network environments, securing

138
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,540
every layer is crucial.

139
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,390
Network design needs to needs
to account for both internal and

140
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,110
external threats, making sure
the security is the top priority.

141
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:21,755
Next, let's discuss about
the industry applications.

142
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:25,435
So far, we are so how are these
applicator technologies being

143
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:27,115
applied in real world industries?

144
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:31,185
Let's look into a few case studies
that I would like to describe.

145
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:36,425
In a financial operation or an enterprise
level operation, network resilience is

146
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,555
key for critical business functions.

147
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:41,925
For instance, in financial
services, companies rely on

148
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:44,510
high availability networks to
ensure uninterrupted operations.

149
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,655
Let's take a look at a few examples.

150
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:52,060
By using layer 2 and layer 3 networking
concepts, financial firms can create

151
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,970
highly resilient networks that minimize
downtime and ensure business continuity.

152
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,430
In the telecom industry, 5G
networks are a new frontier.

153
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,750
With high speed and low latency
capabilities, telecoms are implementing

154
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,290
5G to provide enhanced service delivery.

155
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,180
Here, layer 3 protocols like BGP play a
critical role in managing the flow of data

156
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,100
across large and distributed networks.

157
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:20,915
Another exciting area is the Internet
of Things or IoT in smart cities,

158
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:25,365
for example, IoT manages the device
connectivity and data flow between

159
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:28,055
thousands of sensors and devices.

160
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:32,705
These network needs to be highly
scalable and secure to ensure

161
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:36,495
the safety and efficiency of the
network city's infrastructure.

162
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:40,535
These examples highlight the real
world impact of well designed,

163
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:43,725
resilient and scalable networks
across different industries.

164
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:49,655
Next, let's look into some of the future
trends in networking and discuss about

165
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:55,325
some of the automation or recent AI
upcoming or developments in networking.

166
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,285
So let's start with automation.

167
00:10:57,305 --> 00:11:01,055
Automation is a quickly becoming essential
in network management as network becomes

168
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:06,744
more complex and large managing or
manually conferring and monitoring a

169
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:08,685
large scale network is no longer feasible.

170
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:08,749
Bye for now.

171
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,490
Especially when increasing number of
devices and the complexity of the modern

172
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,410
networks Automated tools now handle
many routine tasks such as configuration

173
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,020
management Network monitoring and
troubleshooting this reduces the human

174
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,220
error and improves overall Operational
efficiency for example rather than having

175
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,270
to manually configure every device and
automation Tool can basically apply

176
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,480
configurations across multiple devices at
once ensuring consistency and saving time.

177
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,440
Moreover, automation helps
with faster issue resolution

178
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,800
when network problem arises.

179
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,480
Automated monitoring systems can detect
and apply pre configured fixes without

180
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,010
the need for human intervention.

181
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,290
Now let's talk about the AI and machine
learning and network management.

182
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,670
Building on the concept of
automation, AI and machine learning

183
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,290
are now playing an increasingly
critical role in network management.

184
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:06,595
AI and ML have introduced proactive
analysis, allowing networks to

185
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:09,085
anticipate issues before they occur.

186
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:15,055
For example, ML algorithms can analyze
historical data to identify patterns that

187
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:20,575
might indicate potential network failures,
enabling protect proactive maintenance.

188
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,105
Anomaly detection is another
key area where AI shines.

189
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,140
AI powered systems can continuously
monitor traffic, identify unusual

190
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,710
behavior that could increase a security
breach, or assist a malfunction.

191
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,060
Once detected, these systems can
automatically apply corrective measures,

192
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,680
minimizing the downtime and reducing
the impact of the potential threats.

193
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,440
AI and ML are also improving network
efficiency through automated decision

194
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:55,275
making by continuously analyzing network
performance, And these technologies can

195
00:12:55,315 --> 00:13:00,695
significantly adjust configurations to
optimize traffic flow, ensuring networks

196
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,565
are always running at peak performance.

197
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:07,525
The perform the future of networking
will heavily rely on intelligent systems

198
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:11,185
to manage increasingly complexity
of the network of modern networks.

199
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:16,085
Now let's look into the
evolving security trends.

200
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:20,795
As network becomes more distributed and
complex, security must also, you want

201
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:22,545
to keep the pace with the new trends.

202
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,350
One of the biggest shifts we are seeing
in the move from traditional security

203
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,650
models to a zero trust architecture.

204
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,200
In a zero trust model, we no longer
assume that trusts are only external.

205
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,030
Instead, we treat every part of
the network as a potential target.

206
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,850
This means every user device and data
must flow through authentication,

207
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,140
authorized, and continuously validated.

208
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,750
It is more rigorous approach, but
one needs to be one needs to make

209
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,770
sure it's really important or
necessary in today's threat landscape.

210
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,290
Within this, we are seeing an adoption
of more sophisticated and encrypted

211
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,730
methods and enhanced identity management
systems, advanced encryption ensures

212
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,674
the data is encrypted and encrypted.

213
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:09,555
It is cannot be read or
altered by any means.

214
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:13,695
Meanwhile, the identity solution
management ensures that only authorized

215
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:16,115
users have access to sensitive data.

216
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:19,535
Network security is no longer
just keeping threads out.

217
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:22,605
It's about protecting the network
from both internal and external.

218
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,725
Risk while maintaining
performance and resilience.

219
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:29,974
Now that we are at the conclusion and
we are trying to wrap up the session.

220
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:33,804
As we wrap up this presentation,
let's take a moment to recap

221
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,424
the point, the key points.

222
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:39,954
We have explored the foundation of routing
and switching, looked at how layer 2 and

223
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:44,474
layer 3 technologies work together to
create resilient and scalable networks.

224
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:48,774
We also discussed the advanced networking
concepts like route distribution, quality

225
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,975
of service, and which are critical
for optimizing performance and complex

226
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:57,565
environments security has been a recurring
theme throughout the today's talk from

227
00:14:57,575 --> 00:15:03,065
access control list ipsecs to Evolving
landscape of zero trust architecture as

228
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:07,815
network continues to grow in complexity
security must remain a top priority We

229
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:12,835
have also test on importance of automation
Ai machine learning in shaping the future

230
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:17,225
of network management These technologies
are not only and not just in the future,

231
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:21,685
they're already transforming how we
design, build, and manage today's network.

232
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:26,415
Finally, we looked into the real world
application of these technologies in

233
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:30,835
industries like financial services,
telecom, IOT, and discussed some of the

234
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:34,935
trends that will continue to prevail
to shape the future of networking.

235
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:38,315
As we move forward, the key
takeaway is that the resilient.

236
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,300
And scalable and secure networks
are foundation of any successful

237
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,970
digital transformation.

238
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,570
The decisions we make today in in
designing these networks will shape

239
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,850
how businesses will operate together.
